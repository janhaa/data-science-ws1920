austen#"When you are tired of eating strawberries in the garden , there shall be cold meat in the house ."" "" Well -- as you please ; only don ' t have a great set out . And , by the bye , can I or my housekeeper be of any use to you with our opinion ?-- Pray be sincere , Knightley . If you wish me to talk to Mrs . Hodges , or to inspect anything --"" "" I have not the least wish for it , I thank you ."" "" Well -- but if any difficulties should arise , my housekeeper is extremely clever ."""
austen#""" I will answer for it , that mine thinks herself full as clever , and would spurn any body ' s assistance ."" "" I wish we had a donkey . The thing would be for us all to come on donkeys , Jane , Miss Bates , and me -- and my caro sposo walking by . I really must talk to him about purchasing a donkey . In a country life I conceive it to be a sort of necessary ; for , let a woman have ever so many resources , it is not possible for her to be always shut up at home ;-- and very long walks , you know -- in summer there is dust , and in winter there is dirt ."" "" You will not find either , between Donwell and Highbury ."
austen#"Donwell Lane is never dusty , and now it is perfectly dry . Come on a donkey , however , if you prefer it . You can borrow Mrs . Cole ' s . I would wish every thing to be as much to your taste as possible ."" "" That I am sure you would . Indeed I do you justice , my good friend ."
austen#"Under that peculiar sort of dry , blunt manner , I know you have the warmest heart . As I tell Mr . E ., you are a thorough humourist .-- Yes , believe me , Knightley , I am fully sensible of your attention to me in the whole of this scheme . You have hit upon the very thing to please me ."" Mr . Knightley had another reason for avoiding a table in the shade . He wished to persuade Mr . Woodhouse , as well as Emma , to join the party ; and he knew that to have any of them sitting down out of doors to eat would inevitably make him ill . Mr . Woodhouse must not , under the specious pretence of a morning drive , and an hour or two spent at Donwell , be tempted away to his misery . He was invited on good faith ."
austen#"No lurking horrors were to upbraid him for his easy credulity . He did consent . He had not been at Donwell for two years . "" Some very fine morning , he , and Emma , and Harriet , could go very well ; and he could sit still with Mrs . Weston , while the dear girls walked about the gardens . He did not suppose they could be damp now , in the middle of the day . He should like to see the old house again exceedingly , and should be very happy to meet Mr . and Mrs . Elton , and any other of his neighbours .-- He could not see any objection at all to his , and Emma ' s , and Harriet ' s going there some very fine morning ."
austen#"He thought it very well done of Mr . Knightley to invite them -- very kind and sensible -- much cleverer than dining out .-- He was not fond of dining out ."" Mr . Knightley was fortunate in every body ' s most ready concurrence . The invitation was everywhere so well received , that it seemed as if , like Mrs . Elton , they were all taking the scheme as a particular compliment to themselves .-- Emma and Harriet professed very high expectations of pleasure from it ; and Mr . Weston , unasked , promised to get Frank over to join them , if possible ; a proof of approbation and gratitude which could have been dispensed with .-- Mr . Knightley was then obliged to say that he should be glad to see him ; and Mr . Weston engaged to lose no time in writing , and spare no arguments to induce him to come . In the meanwhile the lame horse recovered so fast , that the party to Box Hill was again under happy consideration ; and at last Donwell was settled for one day , and Box Hill for the next ,-- the weather appearing exactly right . Under a bright mid - day sun , at almost Midsummer , Mr . Woodhouse was safely conveyed in his carriage , with one window down , to partake of this al - fresco party ; and in one of the most comfortable rooms in the Abbey , especially prepared for him by a fire all the morning , he was happily placed , quite at his ease , ready to talk with pleasure of what had been achieved , and advise every body to come and sit down , and not to heat themselves .-- Mrs . Weston , who seemed to have walked there on purpose to be tired , and sit all the time with him , remained , when all the others were invited or persuaded out , his patient listener and sympathiser . It was so long since Emma had been at the Abbey , that as soon as she was satisfied of her father ' s comfort , she was glad to leave him , and look around her ; eager to refresh and correct her memory with more particular observation , more exact understanding of a house and grounds which must ever be so interesting to her and all her family ."
austen#"She felt all the honest pride and complacency which her alliance with the present and future proprietor could fairly warrant , as she viewed the respectable size and style of the building , its suitable , becoming , characteristic situation , low and sheltered -- its ample gardens stretching down to meadows washed by a stream , of which the Abbey , with all the old neglect of prospect , had scarcely a sight -- and its abundance of timber in rows and avenues , which neither fashion nor extravagance had rooted up .-- The house was larger than Hartfield , and totally unlike it , covering a good deal of ground , rambling and irregular , with many comfortable , and one or two handsome rooms .-- It was just what it ought to be , and it looked what it was -- and Emma felt an increasing respect for it , as the residence of a family of such true gentility , untainted in blood and understanding .-- Some faults of temper John Knightley had ; but Isabella had connected herself unexceptionably . She had given them neither men , nor names , nor places , that could raise a blush . These were pleasant feelings , and she walked about and indulged them till it was necessary to do as the others did , and collect round the strawberry - beds .-- The whole party were assembled , excepting Frank Churchill , who was expected every moment from Richmond ; and Mrs . Elton , in all her apparatus of happiness , her large bonnet and her basket , was very ready to lead the way in gathering , accepting , or talking -- strawberries , and only strawberries , could now be thought or spoken of .--"" The best fruit in England -- every body ' s favourite -- always wholesome .-- These the finest beds and finest sorts .-- Delightful to gather for one ' s self -- the only way of really enjoying them .-- Morning decidedly the best time -- never tired -- every sort good -- hautboy infinitely superior -- no comparison -- the others hardly eatable -- hautboys very scarce -- Chili preferred -- white wood finest flavour of all -- price of strawberries in London -- abundance about Bristol -- Maple Grove -- cultivation -- beds when to be renewed -- gardeners thinking exactly different -- no general rule -- gardeners never to be put out of their way -- delicious fruit -- only too rich to be eaten much of -- inferior to cherries -- currants more refreshing -- only objection to gathering strawberries the stooping -- glaring sun -- tired to death -- could bear it no longer -- must go and sit in the shade ."" Such , for half an hour , was the conversation -- interrupted only once by Mrs . Weston , who came out , in her solicitude after her son - in - law , to inquire if he were come -- and she was a little uneasy .-- She had some fears of his horse . Seats tolerably in the shade were found ; and now Emma was obliged to overhear what Mrs . Elton and Jane Fairfax were talking of .-- A situation , a most desirable situation , was in question . Mrs . Elton had received notice of it that morning , and was in raptures ."
austen#"It was not with Mrs . Suckling , it was not with Mrs . Bragge , but in felicity and splendour it fell short only of them : it was with a cousin of Mrs . Bragge , an acquaintance of Mrs . Suckling , a lady known at Maple Grove . Delightful , charming , superior , first circles , spheres , lines , ranks , every thing -- and Mrs . Elton was wild to have the offer closed with immediately .-- On her side , all was warmth , energy , and triumph -- and she positively refused to take her friend ' s negative , though Miss Fairfax continued to assure her that she would not at present engage in any thing , repeating the same motives which she had been heard to urge before .-- Still Mrs . Elton insisted on being authorised to write an acquiescence by the morrow ' s post .-- How Jane could bear it at all , was astonishing to Emma .-- She did look vexed , she did speak pointedly -- and at last , with a decision of action unusual to her , proposed a removal .-- "" Should not they walk ? Would not Mr . Knightley shew them the gardens -- all the gardens ?-- She wished to see the whole extent ."" -- The pertinacity of her friend seemed more than she could bear . It was hot ; and after walking some time over the gardens in a scattered , dispersed way , scarcely any three together , they insensibly followed one another to the delicious shade of a broad short avenue of limes , which stretching beyond the garden at an equal distance from the river , seemed the finish of the pleasure grounds .-- It led to nothing ; nothing but a view at the end over a low stone wall with high pillars , which seemed intended , in their erection , to give the appearance of an approach to the house , which never had been there . Disputable , however , as might be the taste of such a termination , it was in itself a charming walk , and the view which closed it extremely pretty .-- The considerable slope , at nearly the foot of which the Abbey stood , gradually acquired a steeper form beyond its grounds ; and at half a mile distant was a bank of considerable abruptness and grandeur , well clothed with wood ;-- and at the bottom of this bank , favourably placed and sheltered , rose the Abbey Mill Farm , with meadows in front , and the river making a close and handsome curve around it ."
austen#It was a sweet view -- sweet to the eye and the mind . English verdure , English culture , English comfort , seen under a sun bright , without being oppressive . In this walk Emma and Mr . Weston found all the others assembled ; and towards this view she immediately perceived Mr . Knightley and Harriet distinct from the rest , quietly leading the way . Mr . Knightley and Harriet !-- It was an odd tete - a - tete ; but she was glad to see it .-- There had been a time when he would have scorned her as a companion , and turned from her with little ceremony . Now they seemed in pleasant conversation . There had been a time also when Emma would have been sorry to see Harriet in a spot so favourable for the Abbey Mill Farm ; but now she feared it not .
austen#"It might be safely viewed with all its appendages of prosperity and beauty , its rich pastures , spreading flocks , orchard in blossom , and light column of smoke ascending .-- She joined them at the wall , and found them more engaged in talking than in looking around . He was giving Harriet information as to modes of agriculture , etc . and Emma received a smile which seemed to say , "" These are my own concerns . I have a right to talk on such subjects , without being suspected of introducing Robert Martin ."" -- She did not suspect him . It was too old a story .-- Robert Martin had probably ceased to think of Harriet .-- They took a few turns together along the walk .-- The shade was most refreshing , and Emma found it the pleasantest part of the day ."
austen#"The next remove was to the house ; they must all go in and eat ;-- and they were all seated and busy , and still Frank Churchill did not come . Mrs . Weston looked , and looked in vain . His father would not own himself uneasy , and laughed at her fears ; but she could not be cured of wishing that he would part with his black mare . He had expressed himself as to coming , with more than common certainty . "" His aunt was so much better , that he had not a doubt of getting over to them .""-- Mrs . Churchill ' s state , however , as many were ready to remind her , was liable to such sudden variation as might disappoint her nephew in the most reasonable dependence -- and Mrs . Weston was at last persuaded to believe , or to say , that it must be by some attack of Mrs . Churchill that he was prevented coming .-- Emma looked at Harriet while the point was under consideration ; she behaved very well , and betrayed no emotion ."
austen#The cold repast was over , and the party were to go out once more to see what had not yet been seen , the old Abbey fish - ponds ; perhaps get as far as the clover , which was to be begun cutting on the morrow , or , at any rate , have the pleasure of being hot , and growing cool again .-- Mr . Woodhouse , who had already taken his little round in the highest part of the gardens , where no damps from the river were imagined even by him , stirred no more ; and his daughter resolved to remain with him , that Mrs . Weston might be persuaded away by her husband to the exercise and variety which her spirits seemed to need . Mr . Knightley had done all in his power for Mr . Woodhouse ' s entertainment . Books of engravings , drawers of medals , cameos , corals , shells , and every other family collection within his cabinets , had been prepared for his old friend , to while away the morning ; and the kindness had perfectly answered . Mr . Woodhouse had been exceedingly well amused . Mrs . Weston had been shewing them all to him , and now he would shew them all to Emma ;-- fortunate in having no other resemblance to a child , than in a total want of taste for what he saw , for he was slow , constant , and methodical .-- Before this second looking over was begun , however , Emma walked into the hall for the sake of a few moments ' free observation of the entrance and ground - plot of the house -- and was hardly there , when Jane Fairfax appeared , coming quickly in from the garden , and with a look of escape .-- Little expecting to meet Miss Woodhouse so soon , there was a start at first ; but Miss Woodhouse was the very person she was in quest of .
austen#""" Will you be so kind ,"" said she , "" when I am missed , as to say that I am gone home ?-- I am going this moment .-- My aunt is not aware how late it is , nor how long we have been absent -- but I am sure we shall be wanted , and I am determined to go directly .-- I have said nothing about it to any body . It would only be giving trouble and distress . Some are gone to the ponds , and some to the lime walk . Till they all come in I shall not be missed ; and when they do , will you have the goodness to say that I am gone ?"" "" Certainly , if you wish it ;-- but you are not going to walk to Highbury alone ?"" "" Yes -- what should hurt me ?-- I walk fast ."
austen#"I shall be at home in twenty minutes ."" "" But it is too far , indeed it is , to be walking quite alone . Let my father ' s servant go with you .-- Let me order the carriage . It can be round in five minutes ."" "" Thank you , thank you -- but on no account .-- I would rather walk .-- And for _me_ to be afraid of walking alone !-- I , who may so soon have to guard others !"" She spoke with great agitation ; and Emma very feelingly replied , "" That can be no reason for your being exposed to danger now ."
austen#"I must order the carriage . The heat even would be danger .-- You are fatigued already ."" "" I am ,""-- she answered --"" I am fatigued ; but it is not the sort of fatigue -- quick walking will refresh me .-- Miss Woodhouse , we all know at times what it is to be wearied in spirits . Mine , I confess , are exhausted . The greatest kindness you can shew me , will be to let me have my own way , and only say that I am gone when it is necessary ."" Emma had not another word to oppose ."
austen#"She saw it all ; and entering into her feelings , promoted her quitting the house immediately , and watched her safely off with the zeal of a friend . Her parting look was grateful -- and her parting words , "" Oh ! Miss Woodhouse , the comfort of being sometimes alone !"" -- seemed to burst from an overcharged heart , and to describe somewhat of the continual endurance to be practised by her , even towards some of those who loved her best . "" Such a home , indeed ! such an aunt !"""
austen#"said Emma , as she turned back into the hall again . "" I do pity you . And the more sensibility you betray of their just horrors , the more I shall like you ."" Jane had not been gone a quarter of an hour , and they had only accomplished some views of St . Mark ' s Place , Venice , when Frank Churchill entered the room . Emma had not been thinking of him , she had forgotten to think of him -- but she was very glad to see him . Mrs . Weston would be at ease ."
austen#"The black mare was blameless ; _they_ were right who had named Mrs . Churchill as the cause . He had been detained by a temporary increase of illness in her ; a nervous seizure , which had lasted some hours -- and he had quite given up every thought of coming , till very late ;-- and had he known how hot a ride he should have , and how late , with all his hurry , he must be , he believed he should not have come at all . The heat was excessive ; he had never suffered any thing like it -- almost wished he had staid at home -- nothing killed him like heat -- he could bear any degree of cold , etc ., but heat was intolerable -- and he sat down , at the greatest possible distance from the slight remains of Mr . Woodhouse ' s fire , looking very deplorable . "" You will soon be cooler , if you sit still ,"" said Emma . "" As soon as I am cooler I shall go back again . I could very ill be spared -- but such a point had been made of my coming !"
austen#"You will all be going soon I suppose ; the whole party breaking up . I met _one_ as I came -- Madness in such weather !-- absolute madness !"" Emma listened , and looked , and soon perceived that Frank Churchill ' s state might be best defined by the expressive phrase of being out of humour . Some people were always cross when they were hot . Such might be his constitution ; and as she knew that eating and drinking were often the cure of such incidental complaints , she recommended his taking some refreshment ; he would find abundance of every thing in the dining - room -- and she humanely pointed out the door . "" No -- he should not eat ."
austen#"He was not hungry ; it would only make him hotter ."" In two minutes , however , he relented in his own favour ; and muttering something about spruce - beer , walked off . Emma returned all her attention to her father , saying in secret -- "" I am glad I have done being in love with him . I should not like a man who is so soon discomposed by a hot morning . Harriet ' s sweet easy temper will not mind it ."""
austen#"He was gone long enough to have had a very comfortable meal , and came back all the better -- grown quite cool -- and , with good manners , like himself -- able to draw a chair close to them , take an interest in their employment ; and regret , in a reasonable way , that he should be so late . He was not in his best spirits , but seemed trying to improve them ; and , at last , made himself talk nonsense very agreeably . They were looking over views in Swisserland . "" As soon as my aunt gets well , I shall go abroad ,"" said he . "" I shall never be easy till I have seen some of these places . You will have my sketches , some time or other , to look at -- or my tour to read -- or my poem ."
austen#"I shall do something to expose myself ."" "" That may be -- but not by sketches in Swisserland . You will never go to Swisserland . Your uncle and aunt will never allow you to leave England ."" "" They may be induced to go too . A warm climate may be prescribed for her ."
austen#I have more than half an expectation of our all going abroad . I assure you I have . I feel a strong persuasion , this morning , that I shall soon be abroad . I ought to travel . I am tired of doing nothing . I want a change .
austen#"I am serious , Miss Woodhouse , whatever your penetrating eyes may fancy -- I am sick of England -- and would leave it to - morrow , if I could ."" "" You are sick of prosperity and indulgence . Cannot you invent a few hardships for yourself , and be contented to stay ?"" "" _I_ sick of prosperity and indulgence ! You are quite mistaken . I do not look upon myself as either prosperous or indulged ."
austen#"I am thwarted in every thing material . I do not consider myself at all a fortunate person ."" "" You are not quite so miserable , though , as when you first came . Go and eat and drink a little more , and you will do very well . Another slice of cold meat , another draught of Madeira and water , will make you nearly on a par with the rest of us ."" "" No -- I shall not stir ."
austen#"I shall sit by you . You are my best cure ."" "" We are going to Box Hill to - morrow ;-- you will join us . It is not Swisserland , but it will be something for a young man so much in want of a change . You will stay , and go with us ?"" "" No , certainly not ; I shall go home in the cool of the evening ."""
austen#""" But you may come again in the cool of to - morrow morning ."" "" No -- It will not be worth while . If I come , I shall be cross ."" "" Then pray stay at Richmond ."" "" But if I do , I shall be crosser still . I can never bear to think of you all there without me ."""
austen#""" These are difficulties which you must settle for yourself . Chuse your own degree of crossness . I shall press you no more ."" The rest of the party were now returning , and all were soon collected . With some there was great joy at the sight of Frank Churchill ; others took it very composedly ; but there was a very general distress and disturbance on Miss Fairfax ' s disappearance being explained . That it was time for every body to go , concluded the subject ; and with a short final arrangement for the next day ' s scheme , they parted ."
austen#"Frank Churchill ' s little inclination to exclude himself increased so much , that his last words to Emma were , "" Well ;-- if _you_ wish me to stay and join the party , I will ."" She smiled her acceptance ; and nothing less than a summons from Richmond was to take him back before the following evening . CHAPTER VII They had a very fine day for Box Hill ; and all the other outward circumstances of arrangement , accommodation , and punctuality , were in favour of a pleasant party . Mr . Weston directed the whole , officiating safely between Hartfield and the Vicarage , and every body was in good time ."
austen#Emma and Harriet went together ; Miss Bates and her niece , with the Eltons ; the gentlemen on horseback . Mrs . Weston remained with Mr . Woodhouse . Nothing was wanting but to be happy when they got there . Seven miles were travelled in expectation of enjoyment , and every body had a burst of admiration on first arriving ; but in the general amount of the day there was deficiency . There was a languor , a want of spirits , a want of union , which could not be got over . They separated too much into parties .
austen#The Eltons walked together ; Mr . Knightley took charge of Miss Bates and Jane ; and Emma and Harriet belonged to Frank Churchill . And Mr . Weston tried , in vain , to make them harmonise better . It seemed at first an accidental division , but it never materially varied . Mr . and Mrs . Elton , indeed , shewed no unwillingness to mix , and be as agreeable as they could ; but during the two whole hours that were spent on the hill , there seemed a principle of separation , between the other parties , too strong for any fine prospects , or any cold collation , or any cheerful Mr . Weston , to remove . At first it was downright dulness to Emma . She had never seen Frank Churchill so silent and stupid .
austen#"He said nothing worth hearing -- looked without seeing -- admired without intelligence -- listened without knowing what she said . While he was so dull , it was no wonder that Harriet should be dull likewise ; and they were both insufferable . When they all sat down it was better ; to her taste a great deal better , for Frank Churchill grew talkative and gay , making her his first object . Every distinguishing attention that could be paid , was paid to her . To amuse her , and be agreeable in her eyes , seemed all that he cared for -- and Emma , glad to be enlivened , not sorry to be flattered , was gay and easy too , and gave him all the friendly encouragement , the admission to be gallant , which she had ever given in the first and most animating period of their acquaintance ; but which now , in her own estimation , meant nothing , though in the judgment of most people looking on it must have had such an appearance as no English word but flirtation could very well describe . "" Mr . Frank Churchill and Miss Woodhouse flirted together excessively ."""
austen#"They were laying themselves open to that very phrase -- and to having it sent off in a letter to Maple Grove by one lady , to Ireland by another . Not that Emma was gay and thoughtless from any real felicity ; it was rather because she felt less happy than she had expected . She laughed because she was disappointed ; and though she liked him for his attentions , and thought them all , whether in friendship , admiration , or playfulness , extremely judicious , they were not winning back her heart . She still intended him for her friend . "" How much I am obliged to you ,"" said he , "" for telling me to come to - day !-- If it had not been for you , I should certainly have lost all the happiness of this party . I had quite determined to go away again ."""
austen#""" Yes , you were very cross ; and I do not know what about , except that you were too late for the best strawberries . I was a kinder friend than you deserved . But you were humble . You begged hard to be commanded to come ."" "" Don ' t say I was cross . I was fatigued ."
austen#"The heat overcame me ."" "" It is hotter to - day ."" "" Not to my feelings . I am perfectly comfortable to - day ."" "" You are comfortable because you are under command ."" "" Your command ?-- Yes ."""
austen#""" Perhaps I intended you to say so , but I meant self - command . You had , somehow or other , broken bounds yesterday , and run away from your own management ; but to - day you are got back again -- and as I cannot be always with you , it is best to believe your temper under your own command rather than mine ."" "" It comes to the same thing . I can have no self - command without a motive . You order me , whether you speak or not . And you can be always with me ."
austen#"You are always with me ."" "" Dating from three o ' clock yesterday . My perpetual influence could not begin earlier , or you would not have been so much out of humour before ."" "" Three o ' clock yesterday ! That is your date . I thought I had seen you first in February ."""
austen#""" Your gallantry is really unanswerable . But ( lowering her voice )-- nobody speaks except ourselves , and it is rather too much to be talking nonsense for the entertainment of seven silent people ."" "" I say nothing of which I am ashamed ,"" replied he , with lively impudence . "" I saw you first in February . Let every body on the Hill hear me if they can . Let my accents swell to Mickleham on one side , and Dorking on the other ."
austen#"I saw you first in February ."" And then whispering -- "" Our companions are excessively stupid . What shall we do to rouse them ? Any nonsense will serve . They _shall_ talk . Ladies and gentlemen , I am ordered by Miss Woodhouse ( who , wherever she is , presides ) to say , that she desires to know what you are all thinking of ?"""
austen#"Some laughed , and answered good - humouredly . Miss Bates said a great deal ; Mrs . Elton swelled at the idea of Miss Woodhouse ' s presiding ; Mr . Knightley ' s answer was the most distinct . "" Is Miss Woodhouse sure that she would like to hear what we are all thinking of ?"" "" Oh ! no , no ""-- cried Emma , laughing as carelessly as she could -- "" Upon no account in the world . It is the very last thing I would stand the brunt of just now ."
austen#"Let me hear any thing rather than what you are all thinking of . I will not say quite all . There are one or two , perhaps , ( glancing at Mr . Weston and Harriet ,) whose thoughts I might not be afraid of knowing ."" "" It is a sort of thing ,"" cried Mrs . Elton emphatically , "" which _I_ should not have thought myself privileged to inquire into . Though , perhaps , as the _Chaperon_ of the party -- _I_ never was in any circle -- exploring parties -- young ladies -- married women --"" Her mutterings were chiefly to her husband ; and he murmured , in reply ,"
austen#""" Very true , my love , very true . Exactly so , indeed -- quite unheard of -- but some ladies say any thing . Better pass it off as a joke . Every body knows what is due to _you_ ."" "" It will not do ,"" whispered Frank to Emma ; "" they are most of them affronted . I will attack them with more address ."
austen#"Ladies and gentlemen -- I am ordered by Miss Woodhouse to say , that she waives her right of knowing exactly what you may all be thinking of , and only requires something very entertaining from each of you , in a general way . Here are seven of you , besides myself , ( who , she is pleased to say , am very entertaining already ,) and she only demands from each of you either one thing very clever , be it prose or verse , original or repeated -- or two things moderately clever -- or three things very dull indeed , and she engages to laugh heartily at them all ."" "" Oh ! very well ,"" exclaimed Miss Bates , "" then I need not be uneasy . ` Three things very dull indeed .' That will just do for me , you know ."
austen#"I shall be sure to say three dull things as soon as ever I open my mouth , shan ' t I ? ( looking round with the most good - humoured dependence on every body ' s assent )-- Do not you all think I shall ?"" Emma could not resist . "" Ah ! ma ' am , but there may be a difficulty . Pardon me -- but you will be limited as to number -- only three at once ."""
austen#"Miss Bates , deceived by the mock ceremony of her manner , did not immediately catch her meaning ; but , when it burst on her , it could not anger , though a slight blush shewed that it could pain her . "" Ah !-- well -- to be sure . Yes , I see what she means , ( turning to Mr . Knightley ,) and I will try to hold my tongue . I must make myself very disagreeable , or she would not have said such a thing to an old friend ."" "" I like your plan ,"" cried Mr . Weston . "" Agreed , agreed ."
austen#"I will do my best . I am making a conundrum . How will a conundrum reckon ?"" "" Low , I am afraid , sir , very low ,"" answered his son ;--"" but we shall be indulgent -- especially to any one who leads the way ."" "" No , no ,"" said Emma , "" it will not reckon low . A conundrum of Mr . Weston ' s shall clear him and his next neighbour ."
austen#"Come , sir , pray let me hear it ."" "" I doubt its being very clever myself ,"" said Mr . Weston . "" It is too much a matter of fact , but here it is .-- What two letters of the alphabet are there , that express perfection ?"" "" What two letters !-- express perfection ! I am sure I do not know ."" "" Ah !"
austen#"you will never guess . You , ( to Emma ), I am certain , will never guess .-- I will tell you .-- M . and A .-- Em - ma .-- Do you understand ?"" Understanding and gratification came together . It might be a very indifferent piece of wit , but Emma found a great deal to laugh at and enjoy in it -- and so did Frank and Harriet .-- It did not seem to touch the rest of the party equally ; some looked very stupid about it , and Mr . Knightley gravely said , "" This explains the sort of clever thing that is wanted , and Mr . Weston has done very well for himself ; but he must have knocked up every body else ."
austen#"_Perfection_ should not have come quite so soon ."" "" Oh ! for myself , I protest I must be excused ,"" said Mrs . Elton ; "" _I_ really cannot attempt -- I am not at all fond of the sort of thing . I had an acrostic once sent to me upon my own name , which I was not at all pleased with . I knew who it came from . An abominable puppy !-- You know who I mean ( nodding to her husband )."
austen#These kind of things are very well at Christmas , when one is sitting round the fire ; but quite out of place , in my opinion , when one is exploring about the country in summer . Miss Woodhouse must excuse me . I am not one of those who have witty things at every body ' s service . I do not pretend to be a wit . I have a great deal of vivacity in my own way , but I really must be allowed to judge when to speak and when to hold my tongue . Pass us , if you please , Mr . Churchill .
austen#"Pass Mr . E ., Knightley , Jane , and myself . We have nothing clever to say -- not one of us . "" Yes , yes , pray pass _me_ ,"" added her husband , with a sort of sneering consciousness ; "" _I_ have nothing to say that can entertain Miss Woodhouse , or any other young lady . An old married man -- quite good for nothing . Shall we walk , Augusta ?"" "" With all my heart ."
austen#"I am really tired of exploring so long on one spot . Come , Jane , take my other arm ."" Jane declined it , however , and the husband and wife walked off . "" Happy couple !"" said Frank Churchill , as soon as they were out of hearing :--"" How well they suit one another !-- Very lucky -- marrying as they did , upon an acquaintance formed only in a public place !-- They only knew each other , I think , a few weeks in Bath ! Peculiarly lucky !-- for as to any real knowledge of a person ' s disposition that Bath , or any public place , can give -- it is all nothing ; there can be no knowledge ."
austen#"It is only by seeing women in their own homes , among their own set , just as they always are , that you can form any just judgment . Short of that , it is all guess and luck -- and will generally be ill - luck . How many a man has committed himself on a short acquaintance , and rued it all the rest of his life !"" Miss Fairfax , who had seldom spoken before , except among her own confederates , spoke now . "" Such things do occur , undoubtedly ."" -- She was stopped by a cough ."
austen#"Frank Churchill turned towards her to listen . "" You were speaking ,"" said he , gravely . She recovered her voice . "" I was only going to observe , that though such unfortunate circumstances do sometimes occur both to men and women , I cannot imagine them to be very frequent . A hasty and imprudent attachment may arise -- but there is generally time to recover from it afterwards . I would be understood to mean , that it can be only weak , irresolute characters , ( whose happiness must be always at the mercy of chance ,) who will suffer an unfortunate acquaintance to be an inconvenience , an oppression for ever ."""
austen#"He made no answer ; merely looked , and bowed in submission ; and soon afterwards said , in a lively tone , "" Well , I have so little confidence in my own judgment , that whenever I marry , I hope some body will chuse my wife for me . Will you ? ( turning to Emma .) Will you chuse a wife for me ?-- I am sure I should like any body fixed on by you . You provide for the family , you know , ( with a smile at his father )."
austen#"Find some body for me . I am in no hurry . Adopt her , educate her ."" "" And make her like myself ."" "" By all means , if you can ."" "" Very well ."
austen#"I undertake the commission . You shall have a charming wife ."" "" She must be very lively , and have hazle eyes . I care for nothing else . I shall go abroad for a couple of years -- and when I return , I shall come to you for my wife . Remember ."""
austen#Emma was in no danger of forgetting . It was a commission to touch every favourite feeling . Would not Harriet be the very creature described ? Hazle eyes excepted , two years more might make her all that he wished . He might even have Harriet in his thoughts at the moment ; who could say ? Referring the education to her seemed to imply it .
austen#""" Now , ma ' am ,"" said Jane to her aunt , "" shall we join Mrs . Elton ?"" "" If you please , my dear . With all my heart . I am quite ready . I was ready to have gone with her , but this will do just as well ."
austen#"We shall soon overtake her . There she is -- no , that ' s somebody else . That ' s one of the ladies in the Irish car party , not at all like her .-- Well , I declare --"" They walked off , followed in half a minute by Mr . Knightley . Mr . Weston , his son , Emma , and Harriet , only remained ; and the young man ' s spirits now rose to a pitch almost unpleasant . Even Emma grew tired at last of flattery and merriment , and wished herself rather walking quietly about with any of the others , or sitting almost alone , and quite unattended to , in tranquil observation of the beautiful views beneath her ."
austen#"The appearance of the servants looking out for them to give notice of the carriages was a joyful sight ; and even the bustle of collecting and preparing to depart , and the solicitude of Mrs . Elton to have _her_ carriage first , were gladly endured , in the prospect of the quiet drive home which was to close the very questionable enjoyments of this day of pleasure . Such another scheme , composed of so many ill - assorted people , she hoped never to be betrayed into again . While waiting for the carriage , she found Mr . Knightley by her side . He looked around , as if to see that no one were near , and then said , "" Emma , I must once more speak to you as I have been used to do : a privilege rather endured than allowed , perhaps , but I must still use it . I cannot see you acting wrong , without a remonstrance ."
austen#"How could you be so unfeeling to Miss Bates ? How could you be so insolent in your wit to a woman of her character , age , and situation ?-- Emma , I had not thought it possible ."" Emma recollected , blushed , was sorry , but tried to laugh it off . "" Nay , how could I help saying what I did ?-- Nobody could have helped it . It was not so very bad . I dare say she did not understand me ."""
austen#""" I assure you she did . She felt your full meaning . She has talked of it since . I wish you could have heard how she talked of it -- with what candour and generosity . I wish you could have heard her honouring your forbearance , in being able to pay her such attentions , as she was for ever receiving from yourself and your father , when her society must be so irksome ."" "" Oh !"""
austen#"cried Emma , "" I know there is not a better creature in the world : but you must allow , that what is good and what is ridiculous are most unfortunately blended in her ."" "" They are blended ,"" said he , "" I acknowledge ; and , were she prosperous , I could allow much for the occasional prevalence of the ridiculous over the good . Were she a woman of fortune , I would leave every harmless absurdity to take its chance , I would not quarrel with you for any liberties of manner . Were she your equal in situation -- but , Emma , consider how far this is from being the case . She is poor ; she has sunk from the comforts she was born to ; and , if she live to old age , must probably sink more . Her situation should secure your compassion ."
austen#"It was badly done , indeed ! You , whom she had known from an infant , whom she had seen grow up from a period when her notice was an honour , to have you now , in thoughtless spirits , and the pride of the moment , laugh at her , humble her -- and before her niece , too -- and before others , many of whom ( certainly _some_ ,) would be entirely guided by _your_ treatment of her .-- This is not pleasant to you , Emma -- and it is very far from pleasant to me ; but I must , I will ,-- I will tell you truths while I can ; satisfied with proving myself your friend by very faithful counsel , and trusting that you will some time or other do me greater justice than you can do now ."" While they talked , they were advancing towards the carriage ; it was ready ; and , before she could speak again , he had handed her in . He had misinterpreted the feelings which had kept her face averted , and her tongue motionless . They were combined only of anger against herself , mortification , and deep concern . She had not been able to speak ; and , on entering the carriage , sunk back for a moment overcome -- then reproaching herself for having taken no leave , making no acknowledgment , parting in apparent sullenness , she looked out with voice and hand eager to shew a difference ; but it was just too late ."
austen#He had turned away , and the horses were in motion . She continued to look back , but in vain ; and soon , with what appeared unusual speed , they were half way down the hill , and every thing left far behind . She was vexed beyond what could have been expressed -- almost beyond what she could conceal . Never had she felt so agitated , mortified , grieved , at any circumstance in her life . She was most forcibly struck . The truth of this representation there was no denying .
austen#She felt it at her heart . How could she have been so brutal , so cruel to Miss Bates ! How could she have exposed herself to such ill opinion in any one she valued ! And how suffer him to leave her without saying one word of gratitude , of concurrence , of common kindness ! Time did not compose her . As she reflected more , she seemed but to feel it more .
austen#She never had been so depressed . Happily it was not necessary to speak . There was only Harriet , who seemed not in spirits herself , fagged , and very willing to be silent ; and Emma felt the tears running down her cheeks almost all the way home , without being at any trouble to check them , extraordinary as they were . CHAPTER VIII The wretchedness of a scheme to Box Hill was in Emma ' s thoughts all the evening . How it might be considered by the rest of the party , she could not tell .
austen#"They , in their different homes , and their different ways , might be looking back on it with pleasure ; but in her view it was a morning more completely misspent , more totally bare of rational satisfaction at the time , and more to be abhorred in recollection , than any she had ever passed . A whole evening of back - gammon with her father , was felicity to it . _There_ , indeed , lay real pleasure , for there she was giving up the sweetest hours of the twenty - four to his comfort ; and feeling that , unmerited as might be the degree of his fond affection and confiding esteem , she could not , in her general conduct , be open to any severe reproach . As a daughter , she hoped she was not without a heart . She hoped no one could have said to her , "" How could you be so unfeeling to your father ?-- I must , I will tell you truths while I can ."" Miss Bates should never again -- no , never !"
austen#If attention , in future , could do away the past , she might hope to be forgiven . She had been often remiss , her conscience told her so ; remiss , perhaps , more in thought than fact ; scornful , ungracious . But it should be so no more . In the warmth of true contrition , she would call upon her the very next morning , and it should be the beginning , on her side , of a regular , equal , kindly intercourse . She was just as determined when the morrow came , and went early , that nothing might prevent her . It was not unlikely , she thought , that she might see Mr . Knightley in her way ; or , perhaps , he might come in while she were paying her visit .
austen#"She had no objection . She would not be ashamed of the appearance of the penitence , so justly and truly hers . Her eyes were towards Donwell as she walked , but she saw him not . "" The ladies were all at home ."" She had never rejoiced at the sound before , nor ever before entered the passage , nor walked up the stairs , with any wish of giving pleasure , but in conferring obligation , or of deriving it , except in subsequent ridicule . There was a bustle on her approach ; a good deal of moving and talking ."
austen#"She heard Miss Bates ' s voice , something was to be done in a hurry ; the maid looked frightened and awkward ; hoped she would be pleased to wait a moment , and then ushered her in too soon . The aunt and niece seemed both escaping into the adjoining room . Jane she had a distinct glimpse of , looking extremely ill ; and , before the door had shut them out , she heard Miss Bates saying , "" Well , my dear , I shall _say_ you are laid down upon the bed , and I am sure you are ill enough ."" Poor old Mrs . Bates , civil and humble as usual , looked as if she did not quite understand what was going on . "" I am afraid Jane is not very well ,"" said she , "" but I do not know ; they _tell_ me she is well . I dare say my daughter will be here presently , Miss Woodhouse ."
austen#"I hope you find a chair . I wish Hetty had not gone . I am very little able -- Have you a chair , ma ' am ? Do you sit where you like ? I am sure she will be here presently ."" Emma seriously hoped she would ."
austen#"She had a moment ' s fear of Miss Bates keeping away from her . But Miss Bates soon came --"" Very happy and obliged ""-- but Emma ' s conscience told her that there was not the same cheerful volubility as before -- less ease of look and manner . A very friendly inquiry after Miss Fairfax , she hoped , might lead the way to a return of old feelings . The touch seemed immediate . "" Ah ! Miss Woodhouse , how kind you are !-- I suppose you have heard -- and are come to give us joy ."
austen#This does not seem much like joy , indeed , in me --( twinkling away a tear or two )-- but it will be very trying for us to part with her , after having had her so long , and she has a dreadful headache just now , writing all the morning :-- such long letters , you know , to be written to Colonel Campbell , and Mrs . Dixon . ` My dear ,' said I , ` you will blind yourself '-- for tears were in her eyes perpetually . One cannot wonder , one cannot wonder . It is a great change ; and though she is amazingly fortunate -- such a situation , I suppose , as no young woman before ever met with on first going out -- do not think us ungrateful , Miss Woodhouse , for such surprising good fortune --( again dispersing her tears )-- but , poor dear soul ! if you were to see what a headache she has . When one is in great pain , you know one cannot feel any blessing quite as it may deserve .
austen#She is as low as possible . To look at her , nobody would think how delighted and happy she is to have secured such a situation . You will excuse her not coming to you -- she is not able -- she is gone into her own room -- I want her to lie down upon the bed . ` My dear ,' said I , ` I shall say you are laid down upon the bed :' but , however , she is not ; she is walking about the room . But , now that she has written her letters , she says she shall soon be well . She will be extremely sorry to miss seeing you , Miss Woodhouse , but your kindness will excuse her .
austen#You were kept waiting at the door -- I was quite ashamed -- but somehow there was a little bustle -- for it so happened that we had not heard the knock , and till you were on the stairs , we did not know any body was coming . ` It is only Mrs . Cole ,' said I , ` depend upon it . Nobody else would come so early .' ` Well ,' said she , ` it must be borne some time or other , and it may as well be now .' But then Patty came in , and said it was you . ` Oh !'
austen#"said I , ` it is Miss Woodhouse : I am sure you will like to see her .' -- ` I can see nobody ,' said she ; and up she got , and would go away ; and that was what made us keep you waiting -- and extremely sorry and ashamed we were . ` If you must go , my dear ,' said I , ` you must , and I will say you are laid down upon the bed .'"" Emma was most sincerely interested . Her heart had been long growing kinder towards Jane ; and this picture of her present sufferings acted as a cure of every former ungenerous suspicion , and left her nothing but pity ; and the remembrance of the less just and less gentle sensations of the past , obliged her to admit that Jane might very naturally resolve on seeing Mrs . Cole or any other steady friend , when she might not bear to see herself . She spoke as she felt , with earnest regret and solicitude -- sincerely wishing that the circumstances which she collected from Miss Bates to be now actually determined on , might be as much for Miss Fairfax ' s advantage and comfort as possible ."
austen#""" It must be a severe trial to them all . She had understood it was to be delayed till Colonel Campbell ' s return ."" "" So very kind !"" replied Miss Bates . "" But you are always kind ."" There was no bearing such an "" always ;"" and to break through her dreadful gratitude , Emma made the direct inquiry of --"
austen#""" Where -- may I ask ?-- is Miss Fairfax going ?"" "" To a Mrs . Smallridge -- charming woman -- most superior -- to have the charge of her three little girls -- delightful children . Impossible that any situation could be more replete with comfort ; if we except , perhaps , Mrs . Suckling ' s own family , and Mrs . Bragge ' s ; but Mrs . Smallridge is intimate with both , and in the very same neighbourhood :-- lives only four miles from Maple Grove . Jane will be only four miles from Maple Grove ."" "" Mrs . Elton , I suppose , has been the person to whom Miss Fairfax owes --"" "" Yes , our good Mrs . Elton ."
austen#"The most indefatigable , true friend . She would not take a denial . She would not let Jane say , ` No ;' for when Jane first heard of it , ( it was the day before yesterday , the very morning we were at Donwell ,) when Jane first heard of it , she was quite decided against accepting the offer , and for the reasons you mention ; exactly as you say , she had made up her mind to close with nothing till Colonel Campbell ' s return , and nothing should induce her to enter into any engagement at present -- and so she told Mrs . Elton over and over again -- and I am sure I had no more idea that she would change her mind !-- but that good Mrs . Elton , whose judgment never fails her , saw farther than I did . It is not every body that would have stood out in such a kind way as she did , and refuse to take Jane ' s answer ; but she positively declared she would _not_ write any such denial yesterday , as Jane wished her ; she would wait -- and , sure enough , yesterday evening it was all settled that Jane should go . Quite a surprize to me ! I had not the least idea !-- Jane took Mrs . Elton aside , and told her at once , that upon thinking over the advantages of Mrs . Smallridge ' s situation , she had come to the resolution of accepting it .-- I did not know a word of it till it was all settled ."""
austen#""" You spent the evening with Mrs . Elton ?"" "" Yes , all of us ; Mrs . Elton would have us come . It was settled so , upon the hill , while we were walking about with Mr . Knightley . ` You _must_ _all_ spend your evening with us ,' said she --` I positively must have you _all_ come .'"" "" Mr . Knightley was there too , was he ?"""
austen#""" No , not Mr . Knightley ; he declined it from the first ; and though I thought he would come , because Mrs . Elton declared she would not let him off , he did not ;-- but my mother , and Jane , and I , were all there , and a very agreeable evening we had . Such kind friends , you know , Miss Woodhouse , one must always find agreeable , though every body seemed rather fagged after the morning ' s party . Even pleasure , you know , is fatiguing -- and I cannot say that any of them seemed very much to have enjoyed it . However , _I_ shall always think it a very pleasant party , and feel extremely obliged to the kind friends who included me in it ."" "" Miss Fairfax , I suppose , though you were not aware of it , had been making up her mind the whole day ?"" "" I dare say she had ."""
austen#""" Whenever the time may come , it must be unwelcome to her and all her friends -- but I hope her engagement will have every alleviation that is possible -- I mean , as to the character and manners of the family ."" "" Thank you , dear Miss Woodhouse . Yes , indeed , there is every thing in the world that can make her happy in it . Except the Sucklings and Bragges , there is not such another nursery establishment , so liberal and elegant , in all Mrs . Elton ' s acquaintance . Mrs . Smallridge , a most delightful woman !-- A style of living almost equal to Maple Grove -- and as to the children , except the little Sucklings and little Bragges , there are not such elegant sweet children anywhere . Jane will be treated with such regard and kindness !-- It will be nothing but pleasure , a life of pleasure .-- And her salary !-- I really cannot venture to name her salary to you , Miss Woodhouse ."
austen#"Even you , used as you are to great sums , would hardly believe that so much could be given to a young person like Jane ."" "" Ah ! madam ,"" cried Emma , "" if other children are at all like what I remember to have been myself , I should think five times the amount of what I have ever yet heard named as a salary on such occasions , dearly earned ."" "" You are so noble in your ideas !"" "" And when is Miss Fairfax to leave you ?"" "" Very soon , very soon , indeed ; that ' s the worst of it ."
austen#"Within a fortnight . Mrs . Smallridge is in a great hurry . My poor mother does not know how to bear it . So then , I try to put it out of her thoughts , and say , Come ma ' am , do not let us think about it any more ."" "" Her friends must all be sorry to lose her ; and will not Colonel and Mrs . Campbell be sorry to find that she has engaged herself before their return ?"" "" Yes ; Jane says she is sure they will ; but yet , this is such a situation as she cannot feel herself justified in declining ."
austen#I was so astonished when she first told me what she had been saying to Mrs . Elton , and when Mrs . Elton at the same moment came congratulating me upon it ! It was before tea -- stay -- no , it could not be before tea , because we were just going to cards -- and yet it was before tea , because I remember thinking -- Oh ! no , now I recollect , now I have it ; something happened before tea , but not that . Mr . Elton was called out of the room before tea , old John Abdy ' s son wanted to speak with him . Poor old John , I have a great regard for him ; he was clerk to my poor father twenty - seven years ; and now , poor old man , he is bed - ridden , and very poorly with the rheumatic gout in his joints -- I must go and see him to - day ; and so will Jane , I am sure , if she gets out at all . And poor John ' s son came to talk to Mr . Elton about relief from the parish ; he is very well to do himself , you know , being head man at the Crown , ostler , and every thing of that sort , but still he cannot keep his father without some help ; and so , when Mr . Elton came back , he told us what John ostler had been telling him , and then it came out about the chaise having been sent to Randalls to take Mr . Frank Churchill to Richmond .
austen#"That was what happened before tea . It was after tea that Jane spoke to Mrs . Elton ."" Miss Bates would hardly give Emma time to say how perfectly new this circumstance was to her ; but as without supposing it possible that she could be ignorant of any of the particulars of Mr . Frank Churchill ' s going , she proceeded to give them all , it was of no consequence . What Mr . Elton had learned from the ostler on the subject , being the accumulation of the ostler ' s own knowledge , and the knowledge of the servants at Randalls , was , that a messenger had come over from Richmond soon after the return of the party from Box Hill -- which messenger , however , had been no more than was expected ; and that Mr . Churchill had sent his nephew a few lines , containing , upon the whole , a tolerable account of Mrs . Churchill , and only wishing him not to delay coming back beyond the next morning early ; but that Mr . Frank Churchill having resolved to go home directly , without waiting at all , and his horse seeming to have got a cold , Tom had been sent off immediately for the Crown chaise , and the ostler had stood out and seen it pass by , the boy going a good pace , and driving very steady . There was nothing in all this either to astonish or interest , and it caught Emma ' s attention only as it united with the subject which already engaged her mind ."
austen#"The contrast between Mrs . Churchill ' s importance in the world , and Jane Fairfax ' s , struck her ; one was every thing , the other nothing -- and she sat musing on the difference of woman ' s destiny , and quite unconscious on what her eyes were fixed , till roused by Miss Bates ' s saying , "" Aye , I see what you are thinking of , the pianoforte . What is to become of that ?-- Very true . Poor dear Jane was talking of it just now .-- ` You must go ,' said she . ` You and I must part . You will have no business here .-- Let it stay , however ,' said she ; ` give it houseroom till Colonel Campbell comes back ."
austen#"I shall talk about it to him ; he will settle for me ; he will help me out of all my difficulties .' -- And to this day , I do believe , she knows not whether it was his present or his daughter ' s ."" Now Emma was obliged to think of the pianoforte ; and the remembrance of all her former fanciful and unfair conjectures was so little pleasing , that she soon allowed herself to believe her visit had been long enough ; and , with a repetition of every thing that she could venture to say of the good wishes which she really felt , took leave . CHAPTER IX Emma ' s pensive meditations , as she walked home , were not interrupted ; but on entering the parlour , she found those who must rouse her . Mr . Knightley and Harriet had arrived during her absence , and were sitting with her father .-- Mr ."
austen#"Knightley immediately got up , and in a manner decidedly graver than usual , said , "" I would not go away without seeing you , but I have no time to spare , and therefore must now be gone directly . I am going to London , to spend a few days with John and Isabella . Have you any thing to send or say , besides the ` love ,' which nobody carries ?"" "" Nothing at all . But is not this a sudden scheme ?"""
austen#""" Yes -- rather -- I have been thinking of it some little time ."" Emma was sure he had not forgiven her ; he looked unlike himself . Time , however , she thought , would tell him that they ought to be friends again . While he stood , as if meaning to go , but not going -- her father began his inquiries . "" Well , my dear , and did you get there safely ?-- And how did you find my worthy old friend and her daughter ?-- I dare say they must have been very much obliged to you for coming . Dear Emma has been to call on Mrs . and Miss Bates , Mr . Knightley , as I told you before ."
austen#"She is always so attentive to them !"" Emma ' s colour was heightened by this unjust praise ; and with a smile , and shake of the head , which spoke much , she looked at Mr . Knightley .-- It seemed as if there were an instantaneous impression in her favour , as if his eyes received the truth from her ' s , and all that had passed of good in her feelings were at once caught and honoured .-- He looked at her with a glow of regard . She was warmly gratified -- and in another moment still more so , by a little movement of more than common friendliness on his part .-- He took her hand ;-- whether she had not herself made the first motion , she could not say -- she might , perhaps , have rather offered it -- but he took her hand , pressed it , and certainly was on the point of carrying it to his lips -- when , from some fancy or other , he suddenly let it go .-- Why he should feel such a scruple , why he should change his mind when it was all but done , she could not perceive .-- He would have judged better , she thought , if he had not stopped .-- The intention , however , was indubitable ; and whether it was that his manners had in general so little gallantry , or however else it happened , but she thought nothing became him more .-- It was with him , of so simple , yet so dignified a nature .-- She could not but recall the attempt with great satisfaction . It spoke such perfect amity .-- He left them immediately afterwards -- gone in a moment . He always moved with the alertness of a mind which could neither be undecided nor dilatory , but now he seemed more sudden than usual in his disappearance ."
austen#"Emma could not regret her having gone to Miss Bates , but she wished she had left her ten minutes earlier ;-- it would have been a great pleasure to talk over Jane Fairfax ' s situation with Mr . Knightley .-- Neither would she regret that he should be going to Brunswick Square , for she knew how much his visit would be enjoyed -- but it might have happened at a better time -- and to have had longer notice of it , would have been pleasanter .-- They parted thorough friends , however ; she could not be deceived as to the meaning of his countenance , and his unfinished gallantry ;-- it was all done to assure her that she had fully recovered his good opinion .-- He had been sitting with them half an hour , she found . It was a pity that she had not come back earlier ! In the hope of diverting her father ' s thoughts from the disagreeableness of Mr . Knightley ' s going to London ; and going so suddenly ; and going on horseback , which she knew would be all very bad ; Emma communicated her news of Jane Fairfax , and her dependence on the effect was justified ; it supplied a very useful check ,-- interested , without disturbing him . He had long made up his mind to Jane Fairfax ' s going out as governess , and could talk of it cheerfully , but Mr . Knightley ' s going to London had been an unexpected blow . "" I am very glad , indeed , my dear , to hear she is to be so comfortably settled ."
austen#"Mrs . Elton is very good - natured and agreeable , and I dare say her acquaintance are just what they ought to be . I hope it is a dry situation , and that her health will be taken good care of . It ought to be a first object , as I am sure poor Miss Taylor ' s always was with me . You know , my dear , she is going to be to this new lady what Miss Taylor was to us . And I hope she will be better off in one respect , and not be induced to go away after it has been her home so long ."" The following day brought news from Richmond to throw every thing else into the background ."
austen#An express arrived at Randalls to announce the death of Mrs . Churchill ! Though her nephew had had no particular reason to hasten back on her account , she had not lived above six - and - thirty hours after his return . A sudden seizure of a different nature from any thing foreboded by her general state , had carried her off after a short struggle . The great Mrs . Churchill was no more . It was felt as such things must be felt . Every body had a degree of gravity and sorrow ; tenderness towards the departed , solicitude for the surviving friends ; and , in a reasonable time , curiosity to know where she would be buried .
austen#"Goldsmith tells us , that when lovely woman stoops to folly , she has nothing to do but to die ; and when she stoops to be disagreeable , it is equally to be recommended as a clearer of ill - fame . Mrs . Churchill , after being disliked at least twenty - five years , was now spoken of with compassionate allowances . In one point she was fully justified . She had never been admitted before to be seriously ill . The event acquitted her of all the fancifulness , and all the selfishness of imaginary complaints . "" Poor Mrs . Churchill !"
austen#"no doubt she had been suffering a great deal : more than any body had ever supposed -- and continual pain would try the temper . It was a sad event -- a great shock -- with all her faults , what would Mr . Churchill do without her ? Mr . Churchill ' s loss would be dreadful indeed . Mr . Churchill would never get over it ."" -- Even Mr . Weston shook his head , and looked solemn , and said , "" Ah ! poor woman , who would have thought it !"""
austen#and resolved , that his mourning should be as handsome as possible ; and his wife sat sighing and moralising over her broad hems with a commiseration and good sense , true and steady . How it would affect Frank was among the earliest thoughts of both . It was also a very early speculation with Emma . The character of Mrs . Churchill , the grief of her husband -- her mind glanced over them both with awe and compassion -- and then rested with lightened feelings on how Frank might be affected by the event , how benefited , how freed . She saw in a moment all the possible good . Now , an attachment to Harriet Smith would have nothing to encounter .
austen#Mr . Churchill , independent of his wife , was feared by nobody ; an easy , guidable man , to be persuaded into any thing by his nephew . All that remained to be wished was , that the nephew should form the attachment , as , with all her goodwill in the cause , Emma could feel no certainty of its being already formed . Harriet behaved extremely well on the occasion , with great self - command . What ever she might feel of brighter hope , she betrayed nothing . Emma was gratified , to observe such a proof in her of strengthened character , and refrained from any allusion that might endanger its maintenance . They spoke , therefore , of Mrs . Churchill ' s death with mutual forbearance .
austen#Short letters from Frank were received at Randalls , communicating all that was immediately important of their state and plans . Mr . Churchill was better than could be expected ; and their first removal , on the departure of the funeral for Yorkshire , was to be to the house of a very old friend in Windsor , to whom Mr . Churchill had been promising a visit the last ten years . At present , there was nothing to be done for Harriet ; good wishes for the future were all that could yet be possible on Emma ' s side . It was a more pressing concern to shew attention to Jane Fairfax , whose prospects were closing , while Harriet ' s opened , and whose engagements now allowed of no delay in any one at Highbury , who wished to shew her kindness -- and with Emma it was grown into a first wish . She had scarcely a stronger regret than for her past coldness ; and the person , whom she had been so many months neglecting , was now the very one on whom she would have lavished every distinction of regard or sympathy . She wanted to be of use to her ; wanted to shew a value for her society , and testify respect and consideration .
austen#"She resolved to prevail on her to spend a day at Hartfield . A note was written to urge it . The invitation was refused , and by a verbal message . "" Miss Fairfax was not well enough to write ;"" and when Mr . Perry called at Hartfield , the same morning , it appeared that she was so much indisposed as to have been visited , though against her own consent , by himself , and that she was suffering under severe headaches , and a nervous fever to a degree , which made him doubt the possibility of her going to Mrs . Smallridge ' s at the time proposed . Her health seemed for the moment completely deranged -- appetite quite gone -- and though there were no absolutely alarming symptoms , nothing touching the pulmonary complaint , which was the standing apprehension of the family , Mr . Perry was uneasy about her . He thought she had undertaken more than she was equal to , and that she felt it so herself , though she would not own it ."
austen#Her spirits seemed overcome . Her present home , he could not but observe , was unfavourable to a nervous disorder :-- confined always to one room ;-- he could have wished it otherwise -- and her good aunt , though his very old friend , he must acknowledge to be not the best companion for an invalid of that description . Her care and attention could not be questioned ; they were , in fact , only too great . He very much feared that Miss Fairfax derived more evil than good from them . Emma listened with the warmest concern ; grieved for her more and more , and looked around eager to discover some way of being useful . To take her -- be it only an hour or two -- from her aunt , to give her change of air and scene , and quiet rational conversation , even for an hour or two , might do her good ; and the following morning she wrote again to say , in the most feeling language she could command , that she would call for her in the carriage at any hour that Jane would name -- mentioning that she had Mr . Perry ' s decided opinion , in favour of such exercise for his patient .
austen#"The answer was only in this short note : "" Miss Fairfax ' s compliments and thanks , but is quite unequal to any exercise ."" Emma felt that her own note had deserved something better ; but it was impossible to quarrel with words , whose tremulous inequality shewed indisposition so plainly , and she thought only of how she might best counteract this unwillingness to be seen or assisted . In spite of the answer , therefore , she ordered the carriage , and drove to Mrs . Bates ' s , in the hope that Jane would be induced to join her -- but it would not do ;-- Miss Bates came to the carriage door , all gratitude , and agreeing with her most earnestly in thinking an airing might be of the greatest service -- and every thing that message could do was tried -- but all in vain . Miss Bates was obliged to return without success ; Jane was quite unpersuadable ; the mere proposal of going out seemed to make her worse .-- Emma wished she could have seen her , and tried her own powers ; but , almost before she could hint the wish , Miss Bates made it appear that she had promised her niece on no account to let Miss Woodhouse in . "" Indeed , the truth was , that poor dear Jane could not bear to see any body -- any body at all -- Mrs . Elton , indeed , could not be denied -- and Mrs . Cole had made such a point -- and Mrs . Perry had said so much -- but , except them , Jane would really see nobody ."""
austen#"Emma did not want to be classed with the Mrs . Eltons , the Mrs . Perrys , and the Mrs . Coles , who would force themselves anywhere ; neither could she feel any right of preference herself -- she submitted , therefore , and only questioned Miss Bates farther as to her niece ' s appetite and diet , which she longed to be able to assist . On that subject poor Miss Bates was very unhappy , and very communicative ; Jane would hardly eat any thing :-- Mr . Perry recommended nourishing food ; but every thing they could command ( and never had any body such good neighbours ) was distasteful . Emma , on reaching home , called the housekeeper directly , to an examination of her stores ; and some arrowroot of very superior quality was speedily despatched to Miss Bates with a most friendly note . In half an hour the arrowroot was returned , with a thousand thanks from Miss Bates , but "" dear Jane would not be satisfied without its being sent back ; it was a thing she could not take -- and , moreover , she insisted on her saying , that she was not at all in want of any thing ."" When Emma afterwards heard that Jane Fairfax had been seen wandering about the meadows , at some distance from Highbury , on the afternoon of the very day on which she had , under the plea of being unequal to any exercise , so peremptorily refused to go out with her in the carriage , she could have no doubt -- putting every thing together -- that Jane was resolved to receive no kindness from _her_ . She was sorry , very sorry ."
austen#"Her heart was grieved for a state which seemed but the more pitiable from this sort of irritation of spirits , inconsistency of action , and inequality of powers ; and it mortified her that she was given so little credit for proper feeling , or esteemed so little worthy as a friend : but she had the consolation of knowing that her intentions were good , and of being able to say to herself , that could Mr . Knightley have been privy to all her attempts of assisting Jane Fairfax , could he even have seen into her heart , he would not , on this occasion , have found any thing to reprove . CHAPTER X One morning , about ten days after Mrs . Churchill ' s decease , Emma was called downstairs to Mr . Weston , who "" could not stay five minutes , and wanted particularly to speak with her ."" -- He met her at the parlour - door , and hardly asking her how she did , in the natural key of his voice , sunk it immediately , to say , unheard by her father , "" Can you come to Randalls at any time this morning ?-- Do , if it be possible . Mrs . Weston wants to see you ."
austen#"She must see you ."" "" Is she unwell ?"" "" No , no , not at all -- only a little agitated . She would have ordered the carriage , and come to you , but she must see you _alone_ , and that you know --( nodding towards her father )-- Humph !-- Can you come ?"" "" Certainly . This moment , if you please ."
austen#"It is impossible to refuse what you ask in such a way . But what can be the matter ?-- Is she really not ill ?"" "" Depend upon me -- but ask no more questions . You will know it all in time . The most unaccountable business ! But hush , hush !"""
austen#"To guess what all this meant , was impossible even for Emma . Something really important seemed announced by his looks ; but , as her friend was well , she endeavoured not to be uneasy , and settling it with her father , that she would take her walk now , she and Mr . Weston were soon out of the house together and on their way at a quick pace for Randalls . "" Now ,""-- said Emma , when they were fairly beyond the sweep gates ,-- "" now Mr . Weston , do let me know what has happened ."" "" No , no ,""-- he gravely replied .--"" Don ' t ask me . I promised my wife to leave it all to her . She will break it to you better than I can ."
austen#"Do not be impatient , Emma ; it will all come out too soon ."" "" Break it to me ,"" cried Emma , standing still with terror .-- "" Good God !-- Mr . Weston , tell me at once .-- Something has happened in Brunswick Square . I know it has . Tell me , I charge you tell me this moment what it is ."" "" No , indeed you are mistaken ."""
austen#"-- "" Mr . Weston do not trifle with me .-- Consider how many of my dearest friends are now in Brunswick Square . Which of them is it ?-- I charge you by all that is sacred , not to attempt concealment ."" "" Upon my word , Emma ."" -- "" Your word !-- why not your honour !-- why not say upon your honour , that it has nothing to do with any of them ?"
austen#"Good Heavens !-- What can be to be _broke_ to me , that does not relate to one of that family ?"" "" Upon my honour ,"" said he very seriously , "" it does not . It is not in the smallest degree connected with any human being of the name of Knightley ."" Emma ' s courage returned , and she walked on . "" I was wrong ,"" he continued , "" in talking of its being _broke_ to you . I should not have used the expression ."
austen#"In fact , it does not concern you -- it concerns only myself ,-- that is , we hope .-- Humph !-- In short , my dear Emma , there is no occasion to be so uneasy about it . I don ' t say that it is not a disagreeable business -- but things might be much worse .-- If we walk fast , we shall soon be at Randalls ."" Emma found that she must wait ; and now it required little effort . She asked no more questions therefore , merely employed her own fancy , and that soon pointed out to her the probability of its being some money concern -- something just come to light , of a disagreeable nature in the circumstances of the family ,-- something which the late event at Richmond had brought forward . Her fancy was very active . Half a dozen natural children , perhaps -- and poor Frank cut off !-- This , though very undesirable , would be no matter of agony to her ."
austen#"It inspired little more than an animating curiosity . "" Who is that gentleman on horseback ?"" said she , as they proceeded -- speaking more to assist Mr . Weston in keeping his secret , than with any other view . "" I do not know .-- One of the Otways .-- Not Frank ;-- it is not Frank , I assure you . You will not see him . He is half way to Windsor by this time ."""
austen#""" Has your son been with you , then ?"" "" Oh ! yes -- did not you know ?-- Well , well , never mind ."" For a moment he was silent ; and then added , in a tone much more guarded and demure , "" Yes , Frank came over this morning , just to ask us how we did ."" They hurried on , and were speedily at Randalls .--"" Well , my dear ,"" said he , as they entered the room --"" I have brought her , and now I hope you will soon be better ."
austen#"I shall leave you together . There is no use in delay . I shall not be far off , if you want me ."" -- And Emma distinctly heard him add , in a lower tone , before he quitted the room ,--"" I have been as good as my word . She has not the least idea ."" Mrs . Weston was looking so ill , and had an air of so much perturbation , that Emma ' s uneasiness increased ; and the moment they were alone , she eagerly said ,"
austen#""" What is it my dear friend ? Something of a very unpleasant nature , I find , has occurred ;-- do let me know directly what it is . I have been walking all this way in complete suspense . We both abhor suspense . Do not let mine continue longer . It will do you good to speak of your distress , whatever it may be ."""
austen#""" Have you indeed no idea ?"" said Mrs . Weston in a trembling voice . "" Cannot you , my dear Emma -- cannot you form a guess as to what you are to hear ?"" "" So far as that it relates to Mr . Frank Churchill , I do guess ."" "" You are right . It does relate to him , and I will tell you directly ;"" ( resuming her work , and seeming resolved against looking up .)"
austen#""" He has been here this very morning , on a most extraordinary errand . It is impossible to express our surprize . He came to speak to his father on a subject ,-- to announce an attachment --"" She stopped to breathe . Emma thought first of herself , and then of Harriet . "" More than an attachment , indeed ,"" resumed Mrs . Weston ; "" an engagement -- a positive engagement .-- What will you say , Emma -- what will any body say , when it is known that Frank Churchill and Miss Fairfax are engaged ;-- nay , that they have been long engaged !"""
austen#"Emma even jumped with surprize ;-- and , horror - struck , exclaimed , "" Jane Fairfax !-- Good God ! You are not serious ? You do not mean it ?"" "" You may well be amazed ,"" returned Mrs . Weston , still averting her eyes , and talking on with eagerness , that Emma might have time to recover -- "" You may well be amazed . But it is even so ."
austen#"There has been a solemn engagement between them ever since October -- formed at Weymouth , and kept a secret from every body . Not a creature knowing it but themselves -- neither the Campbells , nor her family , nor his .-- It is so wonderful , that though perfectly convinced of the fact , it is yet almost incredible to myself . I can hardly believe it .-- I thought I knew him ."" Emma scarcely heard what was said .-- Her mind was divided between two ideas -- her own former conversations with him about Miss Fairfax ; and poor Harriet ;-- and for some time she could only exclaim , and require confirmation , repeated confirmation . "" Well ,"" said she at last , trying to recover herself ; "" this is a circumstance which I must think of at least half a day , before I can at all comprehend it . What !-- engaged to her all the winter -- before either of them came to Highbury ?"""
austen#""" Engaged since October ,-- secretly engaged .-- It has hurt me , Emma , very much . It has hurt his father equally . _Some_ _part_ of his conduct we cannot excuse ."" Emma pondered a moment , and then replied , "" I will not pretend _not_ to understand you ; and to give you all the relief in my power , be assured that no such effect has followed his attentions to me , as you are apprehensive of ."" Mrs . Weston looked up , afraid to believe ; but Emma ' s countenance was as steady as her words . "" That you may have less difficulty in believing this boast , of my present perfect indifference ,"" she continued , "" I will farther tell you , that there was a period in the early part of our acquaintance , when I did like him , when I was very much disposed to be attached to him -- nay , was attached -- and how it came to cease , is perhaps the wonder ."
austen#"Fortunately , however , it did cease . I have really for some time past , for at least these three months , cared nothing about him . You may believe me , Mrs . Weston . This is the simple truth ."" Mrs . Weston kissed her with tears of joy ; and when she could find utterance , assured her , that this protestation had done her more good than any thing else in the world could do . "" Mr . Weston will be almost as much relieved as myself ,"" said she ."
austen#""" On this point we have been wretched . It was our darling wish that you might be attached to each other -- and we were persuaded that it was so .-- Imagine what we have been feeling on your account ."" "" I have escaped ; and that I should escape , may be a matter of grateful wonder to you and myself . But this does not acquit _him_ , Mrs . Weston ; and I must say , that I think him greatly to blame . What right had he to come among us with affection and faith engaged , and with manners so _very_ disengaged ? What right had he to endeavour to please , as he certainly did -- to distinguish any one young woman with persevering attention , as he certainly did -- while he really belonged to another ?-- How could he tell what mischief he might be doing ?-- How could he tell that he might not be making me in love with him ?-- very wrong , very wrong indeed ."""
austen#""" From something that he said , my dear Emma , I rather imagine --"" "" And how could _she_ bear such behaviour ! Composure with a witness ! to look on , while repeated attentions were offering to another woman , before her face , and not resent it .-- That is a degree of placidity , which I can neither comprehend nor respect ."" "" There were misunderstandings between them , Emma ; he said so expressly . He had not time to enter into much explanation ."
austen#"He was here only a quarter of an hour , and in a state of agitation which did not allow the full use even of the time he could stay -- but that there had been misunderstandings he decidedly said . The present crisis , indeed , seemed to be brought on by them ; and those misunderstandings might very possibly arise from the impropriety of his conduct ."" "" Impropriety ! Oh ! Mrs . Weston -- it is too calm a censure . Much , much beyond impropriety !-- It has sunk him , I cannot say how it has sunk him in my opinion ."
austen#"So unlike what a man should be !-- None of that upright integrity , that strict adherence to truth and principle , that disdain of trick and littleness , which a man should display in every transaction of his life ."" "" Nay , dear Emma , now I must take his part ; for though he has been wrong in this instance , I have known him long enough to answer for his having many , very many , good qualities ; and --"" "" Good God !"" cried Emma , not attending to her .--"" Mrs . Smallridge , too ! Jane actually on the point of going as governess !"
austen#"What could he mean by such horrible indelicacy ? To suffer her to engage herself -- to suffer her even to think of such a measure !"" "" He knew nothing about it , Emma . On this article I can fully acquit him . It was a private resolution of hers , not communicated to him -- or at least not communicated in a way to carry conviction .-- Till yesterday , I know he said he was in the dark as to her plans . They burst on him , I do not know how , but by some letter or message -- and it was the discovery of what she was doing , of this very project of hers , which determined him to come forward at once , own it all to his uncle , throw himself on his kindness , and , in short , put an end to the miserable state of concealment that had been carrying on so long ."""
austen#"Emma began to listen better . "" I am to hear from him soon ,"" continued Mrs . Weston . "" He told me at parting , that he should soon write ; and he spoke in a manner which seemed to promise me many particulars that could not be given now . Let us wait , therefore , for this letter . It may bring many extenuations . It may make many things intelligible and excusable which now are not to be understood ."
austen#"Don ' t let us be severe , don ' t let us be in a hurry to condemn him . Let us have patience . I must love him ; and now that I am satisfied on one point , the one material point , I am sincerely anxious for its all turning out well , and ready to hope that it may . They must both have suffered a great deal under such a system of secresy and concealment ."" "" _His_ sufferings ,"" replied Emma dryly , "" do not appear to have done him much harm . Well , and how did Mr . Churchill take it ?"""
austen#""" Most favourably for his nephew -- gave his consent with scarcely a difficulty . Conceive what the events of a week have done in that family ! While poor Mrs . Churchill lived , I suppose there could not have been a hope , a chance , a possibility ;-- but scarcely are her remains at rest in the family vault , than her husband is persuaded to act exactly opposite to what she would have required . What a blessing it is , when undue influence does not survive the grave !-- He gave his consent with very little persuasion ."" "" Ah !"" thought Emma , "" he would have done as much for Harriet ."""
austen#""" This was settled last night , and Frank was off with the light this morning . He stopped at Highbury , at the Bates ' s , I fancy , some time -- and then came on hither ; but was in such a hurry to get back to his uncle , to whom he is just now more necessary than ever , that , as I tell you , he could stay with us but a quarter of an hour .-- He was very much agitated -- very much , indeed -- to a degree that made him appear quite a different creature from any thing I had ever seen him before .-- In addition to all the rest , there had been the shock of finding her so very unwell , which he had had no previous suspicion of -- and there was every appearance of his having been feeling a great deal ."" "" And do you really believe the affair to have been carrying on with such perfect secresy ?-- The Campbells , the Dixons , did none of them know of the engagement ?"" Emma could not speak the name of Dixon without a little blush . "" None ; not one . He positively said that it had been known to no being in the world but their two selves ."""
austen#""" Well ,"" said Emma , "" I suppose we shall gradually grow reconciled to the idea , and I wish them very happy . But I shall always think it a very abominable sort of proceeding . What has it been but a system of hypocrisy and deceit ,-- espionage , and treachery ?-- To come among us with professions of openness and simplicity ; and such a league in secret to judge us all !-- Here have we been , the whole winter and spring , completely duped , fancying ourselves all on an equal footing of truth and honour , with two people in the midst of us who may have been carrying round , comparing and sitting in judgment on sentiments and words that were never meant for both to hear .-- They must take the consequence , if they have heard each other spoken of in a way not perfectly agreeable !"" "" I am quite easy on that head ,"" replied Mrs . Weston . "" I am very sure that I never said any thing of either to the other , which both might not have heard ."" "" You are in luck .-- Your only blunder was confined to my ear , when you imagined a certain friend of ours in love with the lady ."""
austen#""" True . But as I have always had a thoroughly good opinion of Miss Fairfax , I never could , under any blunder , have spoken ill of her ; and as to speaking ill of him , there I must have been safe ."" At this moment Mr . Weston appeared at a little distance from the window , evidently on the watch . His wife gave him a look which invited him in ; and , while he was coming round , added , "" Now , dearest Emma , let me intreat you to say and look every thing that may set his heart at ease , and incline him to be satisfied with the match . Let us make the best of it -- and , indeed , almost every thing may be fairly said in her favour . It is not a connexion to gratify ; but if Mr . Churchill does not feel that , why should we ?"
austen#"and it may be a very fortunate circumstance for him , for Frank , I mean , that he should have attached himself to a girl of such steadiness of character and good judgment as I have always given her credit for -- and still am disposed to give her credit for , in spite of this one great deviation from the strict rule of right . And how much may be said in her situation for even that error !"" "" Much , indeed !"" cried Emma feelingly . "" If a woman can ever be excused for thinking only of herself , it is in a situation like Jane Fairfax ' s .-- Of such , one may almost say , that ` the world is not their ' s , nor the world ' s law .'"" She met Mr . Weston on his entrance , with a smiling countenance , exclaiming ,"
austen#""" A very pretty trick you have been playing me , upon my word ! This was a device , I suppose , to sport with my curiosity , and exercise my talent of guessing . But you really frightened me . I thought you had lost half your property , at least . And here , instead of its being a matter of condolence , it turns out to be one of congratulation .-- I congratulate you , Mr . Weston , with all my heart , on the prospect of having one of the most lovely and accomplished young women in England for your daughter ."" A glance or two between him and his wife , convinced him that all was as right as this speech proclaimed ; and its happy effect on his spirits was immediate ."
austen#"His air and voice recovered their usual briskness : he shook her heartily and gratefully by the hand , and entered on the subject in a manner to prove , that he now only wanted time and persuasion to think the engagement no very bad thing . His companions suggested only what could palliate imprudence , or smooth objections ; and by the time they had talked it all over together , and he had talked it all over again with Emma , in their walk back to Hartfield , he was become perfectly reconciled , and not far from thinking it the very best thing that Frank could possibly have done . CHAPTER XI "" Harriet , poor Harriet !"" -- Those were the words ; in them lay the tormenting ideas which Emma could not get rid of , and which constituted the real misery of the business to her . Frank Churchill had behaved very ill by herself -- very ill in many ways ,-- but it was not so much _his_ behaviour as her _own_ , which made her so angry with him ."
austen#"It was the scrape which he had drawn her into on Harriet ' s account , that gave the deepest hue to his offence .-- Poor Harriet ! to be a second time the dupe of her misconceptions and flattery . Mr . Knightley had spoken prophetically , when he once said , "" Emma , you have been no friend to Harriet Smith ."" -- She was afraid she had done her nothing but disservice .-- It was true that she had not to charge herself , in this instance as in the former , with being the sole and original author of the mischief ; with having suggested such feelings as might otherwise never have entered Harriet ' s imagination ; for Harriet had acknowledged her admiration and preference of Frank Churchill before she had ever given her a hint on the subject ; but she felt completely guilty of having encouraged what she might have repressed . She might have prevented the indulgence and increase of such sentiments . Her influence would have been enough ."
austen#"And now she was very conscious that she ought to have prevented them .-- She felt that she had been risking her friend ' s happiness on most insufficient grounds . Common sense would have directed her to tell Harriet , that she must not allow herself to think of him , and that there were five hundred chances to one against his ever caring for her .--"" But , with common sense ,"" she added , "" I am afraid I have had little to do ."" She was extremely angry with herself . If she could not have been angry with Frank Churchill too , it would have been dreadful .-- As for Jane Fairfax , she might at least relieve her feelings from any present solicitude on her account . Harriet would be anxiety enough ; she need no longer be unhappy about Jane , whose troubles and whose ill - health having , of course , the same origin , must be equally under cure .-- Her days of insignificance and evil were over .-- She would soon be well , and happy , and prosperous .-- Emma could now imagine why her own attentions had been slighted . This discovery laid many smaller matters open ."
austen#No doubt it had been from jealousy .-- In Jane ' s eyes she had been a rival ; and well might any thing she could offer of assistance or regard be repulsed . An airing in the Hartfield carriage would have been the rack , and arrowroot from the Hartfield storeroom must have been poison . She understood it all ; and as far as her mind could disengage itself from the injustice and selfishness of angry feelings , she acknowledged that Jane Fairfax would have neither elevation nor happiness beyond her desert . But poor Harriet was such an engrossing charge ! There was little sympathy to be spared for any body else . Emma was sadly fearful that this second disappointment would be more severe than the first .
austen#"Considering the very superior claims of the object , it ought ; and judging by its apparently stronger effect on Harriet ' s mind , producing reserve and self - command , it would .-- She must communicate the painful truth , however , and as soon as possible . An injunction of secresy had been among Mr . Weston ' s parting words . "" For the present , the whole affair was to be completely a secret . Mr . Churchill had made a point of it , as a token of respect to the wife he had so very recently lost ; and every body admitted it to be no more than due decorum ."" -- Emma had promised ; but still Harriet must be excepted . It was her superior duty ."
austen#"In spite of her vexation , she could not help feeling it almost ridiculous , that she should have the very same distressing and delicate office to perform by Harriet , which Mrs . Weston had just gone through by herself . The intelligence , which had been so anxiously announced to her , she was now to be anxiously announcing to another . Her heart beat quick on hearing Harriet ' s footstep and voice ; so , she supposed , had poor Mrs . Weston felt when _she_ was approaching Randalls . Could the event of the disclosure bear an equal resemblance !-- But of that , unfortunately , there could be no chance . "" Well , Miss Woodhouse !"" cried Harriet , coming eagerly into the room -- "" is not this the oddest news that ever was ?"""
austen#""" What news do you mean ?"" replied Emma , unable to guess , by look or voice , whether Harriet could indeed have received any hint . "" About Jane Fairfax . Did you ever hear any thing so strange ? Oh !-- you need not be afraid of owning it to me , for Mr . Weston has told me himself . I met him just now ."
austen#"He told me it was to be a great secret ; and , therefore , I should not think of mentioning it to any body but you , but he said you knew it ."" "" What did Mr . Weston tell you ?"" -- said Emma , still perplexed . "" Oh ! he told me all about it ; that Jane Fairfax and Mr . Frank Churchill are to be married , and that they have been privately engaged to one another this long while . How very odd !"""
austen#"It was , indeed , so odd ; Harriet ' s behaviour was so extremely odd , that Emma did not know how to understand it . Her character appeared absolutely changed . She seemed to propose shewing no agitation , or disappointment , or peculiar concern in the discovery . Emma looked at her , quite unable to speak . "" Had you any idea ,"" cried Harriet , "" of his being in love with her ?-- You , perhaps , might .-- You ( blushing as she spoke ) who can see into every body ' s heart ; but nobody else --"" "" Upon my word ,"" said Emma , "" I begin to doubt my having any such talent ."
austen#"Can you seriously ask me , Harriet , whether I imagined him attached to another woman at the very time that I was -- tacitly , if not openly -- encouraging you to give way to your own feelings ?-- I never had the slightest suspicion , till within the last hour , of Mr . Frank Churchill ' s having the least regard for Jane Fairfax . You may be very sure that if I had , I should have cautioned you accordingly ."" "" Me !"" cried Harriet , colouring , and astonished . "" Why should you caution me ?-- You do not think I care about Mr . Frank Churchill ."" "" I am delighted to hear you speak so stoutly on the subject ,"" replied Emma , smiling ; "" but you do not mean to deny that there was a time -- and not very distant either -- when you gave me reason to understand that you did care about him ?"""
austen#""" Him !-- never , never . Dear Miss Woodhouse , how could you so mistake me ?"" turning away distressed . "" Harriet !"" cried Emma , after a moment ' s pause --"" What do you mean ?-- Good Heaven ! what do you mean ?-- Mistake you !-- Am I to suppose then ?--"""
austen#"She could not speak another word .-- Her voice was lost ; and she sat down , waiting in great terror till Harriet should answer . Harriet , who was standing at some distance , and with face turned from her , did not immediately say any thing ; and when she did speak , it was in a voice nearly as agitated as Emma ' s . "" I should not have thought it possible ,"" she began , "" that you could have misunderstood me ! I know we agreed never to name him -- but considering how infinitely superior he is to every body else , I should not have thought it possible that I could be supposed to mean any other person . Mr . Frank Churchill , indeed ! I do not know who would ever look at him in the company of the other ."
austen#"I hope I have a better taste than to think of Mr . Frank Churchill , who is like nobody by his side . And that you should have been so mistaken , is amazing !-- I am sure , but for believing that you entirely approved and meant to encourage me in my attachment , I should have considered it at first too great a presumption almost , to dare to think of him . At first , if you had not told me that more wonderful things had happened ; that there had been matches of greater disparity ( those were your very words );-- I should not have dared to give way to -- I should not have thought it possible -- But if _you_ , who had been always acquainted with him --"" "" Harriet !"" cried Emma , collecting herself resolutely --"" Let us understand each other now , without the possibility of farther mistake . Are you speaking of -- Mr ."
austen#"Knightley ?"" "" To be sure I am . I never could have an idea of any body else -- and so I thought you knew . When we talked about him , it was as clear as possible ."" "" Not quite ,"" returned Emma , with forced calmness , "" for all that you then said , appeared to me to relate to a different person . I could almost assert that you had _named_ Mr . Frank Churchill ."
austen#"I am sure the service Mr . Frank Churchill had rendered you , in protecting you from the gipsies , was spoken of ."" "" Oh ! Miss Woodhouse , how you do forget !"" "" My dear Harriet , I perfectly remember the substance of what I said on the occasion . I told you that I did not wonder at your attachment ; that considering the service he had rendered you , it was extremely natural :-- and you agreed to it , expressing yourself very warmly as to your sense of that service , and mentioning even what your sensations had been in seeing him come forward to your rescue .-- The impression of it is strong on my memory ."" "" Oh , dear ,"" cried Harriet , "" now I recollect what you mean ; but I was thinking of something very different at the time ."
austen#"It was not the gipsies -- it was not Mr . Frank Churchill that I meant . No ! ( with some elevation ) I was thinking of a much more precious circumstance -- of Mr . Knightley ' s coming and asking me to dance , when Mr . Elton would not stand up with me ; and when there was no other partner in the room . That was the kind action ; that was the noble benevolence and generosity ; that was the service which made me begin to feel how superior he was to every other being upon earth ."" "" Good God !"" cried Emma , "" this has been a most unfortunate -- most deplorable mistake !-- What is to be done ?"""
austen#""" You would not have encouraged me , then , if you had understood me ? At least , however , I cannot be worse off than I should have been , if the other had been the person ; and now -- it _is_ possible --"" She paused a few moments . Emma could not speak . "" I do not wonder , Miss Woodhouse ,"" she resumed , "" that you should feel a great difference between the two , as to me or as to any body . You must think one five hundred million times more above me than the other ."
austen#"But I hope , Miss Woodhouse , that supposing -- that if -- strange as it may appear --. But you know they were your own words , that _more_ wonderful things had happened , matches of _greater_ disparity had taken place than between Mr . Frank Churchill and me ; and , therefore , it seems as if such a thing even as this , may have occurred before -- and if I should be so fortunate , beyond expression , as to -- if Mr . Knightley should really -- if _he_ does not mind the disparity , I hope , dear Miss Woodhouse , you will not set yourself against it , and try to put difficulties in the way . But you are too good for that , I am sure ."" Harriet was standing at one of the windows . Emma turned round to look at her in consternation , and hastily said , "" Have you any idea of Mr . Knightley ' s returning your affection ?"""
austen#""" Yes ,"" replied Harriet modestly , but not fearfully --"" I must say that I have ."" Emma ' s eyes were instantly withdrawn ; and she sat silently meditating , in a fixed attitude , for a few minutes . A few minutes were sufficient for making her acquainted with her own heart . A mind like hers , once opening to suspicion , made rapid progress . She touched -- she admitted -- she acknowledged the whole truth . Why was it so much worse that Harriet should be in love with Mr . Knightley , than with Frank Churchill ?"
austen#Why was the evil so dreadfully increased by Harriet ' s having some hope of a return ? It darted through her , with the speed of an arrow , that Mr . Knightley must marry no one but herself ! Her own conduct , as well as her own heart , was before her in the same few minutes . She saw it all with a clearness which had never blessed her before . How improperly had she been acting by Harriet ! How inconsiderate , how indelicate , how irrational , how unfeeling had been her conduct !
austen#What blindness , what madness , had led her on ! It struck her with dreadful force , and she was ready to give it every bad name in the world . Some portion of respect for herself , however , in spite of all these demerits -- some concern for her own appearance , and a strong sense of justice by Harriet --( there would be no need of _compassion_ to the girl who believed herself loved by Mr . Knightley -- but justice required that she should not be made unhappy by any coldness now ,) gave Emma the resolution to sit and endure farther with calmness , with even apparent kindness .-- For her own advantage indeed , it was fit that the utmost extent of Harriet ' s hopes should be enquired into ; and Harriet had done nothing to forfeit the regard and interest which had been so voluntarily formed and maintained -- or to deserve to be slighted by the person , whose counsels had never led her right .-- Rousing from reflection , therefore , and subduing her emotion , she turned to Harriet again , and , in a more inviting accent , renewed the conversation ; for as to the subject which had first introduced it , the wonderful story of Jane Fairfax , that was quite sunk and lost .-- Neither of them thought but of Mr . Knightley and themselves . Harriet , who had been standing in no unhappy reverie , was yet very glad to be called from it , by the now encouraging manner of such a judge , and such a friend as Miss Woodhouse , and only wanted invitation , to give the history of her hopes with great , though trembling delight .-- Emma ' s tremblings as she asked , and as she listened , were better concealed than Harriet ' s , but they were not less . Her voice was not unsteady ; but her mind was in all the perturbation that such a development of self , such a burst of threatening evil , such a confusion of sudden and perplexing emotions , must create .-- She listened with much inward suffering , but with great outward patience , to Harriet ' s detail .-- Methodical , or well arranged , or very well delivered , it could not be expected to be ; but it contained , when separated from all the feebleness and tautology of the narration , a substance to sink her spirit -- especially with the corroborating circumstances , which her own memory brought in favour of Mr . Knightley ' s most improved opinion of Harriet . Harriet had been conscious of a difference in his behaviour ever since those two decisive dances .-- Emma knew that he had , on that occasion , found her much superior to his expectation .
austen#From that evening , or at least from the time of Miss Woodhouse ' s encouraging her to think of him , Harriet had begun to be sensible of his talking to her much more than he had been used to do , and of his having indeed quite a different manner towards her ; a manner of kindness and sweetness !-- Latterly she had been more and more aware of it . When they had been all walking together , he had so often come and walked by her , and talked so very delightfully !-- He seemed to want to be acquainted with her . Emma knew it to have been very much the case . She had often observed the change , to almost the same extent .-- Harriet repeated expressions of approbation and praise from him -- and Emma felt them to be in the closest agreement with what she had known of his opinion of Harriet . He praised her for being without art or affectation , for having simple , honest , generous , feelings .-- She knew that he saw such recommendations in Harriet ; he had dwelt on them to her more than once .-- Much that lived in Harriet ' s memory , many little particulars of the notice she had received from him , a look , a speech , a removal from one chair to another , a compliment implied , a preference inferred , had been unnoticed , because unsuspected , by Emma . Circumstances that might swell to half an hour ' s relation , and contained multiplied proofs to her who had seen them , had passed undiscerned by her who now heard them ; but the two latest occurrences to be mentioned , the two of strongest promise to Harriet , were not without some degree of witness from Emma herself .-- The first , was his walking with her apart from the others , in the lime - walk at Donwell , where they had been walking some time before Emma came , and he had taken pains ( as she was convinced ) to draw her from the rest to himself -- and at first , he had talked to her in a more particular way than he had ever done before , in a very particular way indeed !--( Harriet could not recall it without a blush .)
austen#"He seemed to be almost asking her , whether her affections were engaged .-- But as soon as she ( Miss Woodhouse ) appeared likely to join them , he changed the subject , and began talking about farming :-- The second , was his having sat talking with her nearly half an hour before Emma came back from her visit , the very last morning of his being at Hartfield -- though , when he first came in , he had said that he could not stay five minutes -- and his having told her , during their conversation , that though he must go to London , it was very much against his inclination that he left home at all , which was much more ( as Emma felt ) than he had acknowledged to _her_ . The superior degree of confidence towards Harriet , which this one article marked , gave her severe pain . On the subject of the first of the two circumstances , she did , after a little reflection , venture the following question . "" Might he not ?-- Is not it possible , that when enquiring , as you thought , into the state of your affections , he might be alluding to Mr . Martin -- he might have Mr . Martin ' s interest in view ? But Harriet rejected the suspicion with spirit . "" Mr . Martin !"
austen#"No indeed !-- There was not a hint of Mr . Martin . I hope I know better now , than to care for Mr . Martin , or to be suspected of it ."" When Harriet had closed her evidence , she appealed to her dear Miss Woodhouse , to say whether she had not good ground for hope . "" I never should have presumed to think of it at first ,"" said she , "" but for you . You told me to observe him carefully , and let his behaviour be the rule of mine -- and so I have . But now I seem to feel that I may deserve him ; and that if he does chuse me , it will not be any thing so very wonderful ."""
austen#"The bitter feelings occasioned by this speech , the many bitter feelings , made the utmost exertion necessary on Emma ' s side , to enable her to say on reply , "" Harriet , I will only venture to declare , that Mr . Knightley is the last man in the world , who would intentionally give any woman the idea of his feeling for her more than he really does ."" Harriet seemed ready to worship her friend for a sentence so satisfactory ; and Emma was only saved from raptures and fondness , which at that moment would have been dreadful penance , by the sound of her father ' s footsteps . He was coming through the hall . Harriet was too much agitated to encounter him . "" She could not compose herself -- Mr . Woodhouse would be alarmed -- she had better go ;""-- with most ready encouragement from her friend , therefore , she passed off through another door -- and the moment she was gone , this was the spontaneous burst of Emma ' s feelings : "" Oh God !"
austen#"that I had never seen her !"" The rest of the day , the following night , were hardly enough for her thoughts .-- She was bewildered amidst the confusion of all that had rushed on her within the last few hours . Every moment had brought a fresh surprize ; and every surprize must be matter of humiliation to her .-- How to understand it all ! How to understand the deceptions she had been thus practising on herself , and living under !-- The blunders , the blindness of her own head and heart !-- she sat still , she walked about , she tried her own room , she tried the shrubbery -- in every place , every posture , she perceived that she had acted most weakly ; that she had been imposed on by others in a most mortifying degree ; that she had been imposing on herself in a degree yet more mortifying ; that she was wretched , and should probably find this day but the beginning of wretchedness . To understand , thoroughly understand her own heart , was the first endeavour . To that point went every leisure moment which her father ' s claims on her allowed , and every moment of involuntary absence of mind ."
austen#How long had Mr . Knightley been so dear to her , as every feeling declared him now to be ? When had his influence , such influence begun ?-- When had he succeeded to that place in her affection , which Frank Churchill had once , for a short period , occupied ?-- She looked back ; she compared the two -- compared them , as they had always stood in her estimation , from the time of the latter ' s becoming known to her -- and as they must at any time have been compared by her , had it -- oh ! had it , by any blessed felicity , occurred to her , to institute the comparison .-- She saw that there never had been a time when she did not consider Mr . Knightley as infinitely the superior , or when his regard for her had not been infinitely the most dear . She saw , that in persuading herself , in fancying , in acting to the contrary , she had been entirely under a delusion , totally ignorant of her own heart -- and , in short , that she had never really cared for Frank Churchill at all ! This was the conclusion of the first series of reflection . This was the knowledge of herself , on the first question of inquiry , which she reached ; and without being long in reaching it .-- She was most sorrowfully indignant ; ashamed of every sensation but the one revealed to her -- her affection for Mr .
austen#Knightley .-- Every other part of her mind was disgusting . With insufferable vanity had she believed herself in the secret of every body ' s feelings ; with unpardonable arrogance proposed to arrange every body ' s destiny . She was proved to have been universally mistaken ; and she had not quite done nothing -- for she had done mischief . She had brought evil on Harriet , on herself , and she too much feared , on Mr . Knightley .-- Were this most unequal of all connexions to take place , on her must rest all the reproach of having given it a beginning ; for his attachment , she must believe to be produced only by a consciousness of Harriet ' s ;-- and even were this not the case , he would never have known Harriet at all but for her folly . Mr . Knightley and Harriet Smith !-- It was a union to distance every wonder of the kind .-- The attachment of Frank Churchill and Jane Fairfax became commonplace , threadbare , stale in the comparison , exciting no surprize , presenting no disparity , affording nothing to be said or thought .-- Mr .
austen#Knightley and Harriet Smith !-- Such an elevation on her side ! Such a debasement on his ! It was horrible to Emma to think how it must sink him in the general opinion , to foresee the smiles , the sneers , the merriment it would prompt at his expense ; the mortification and disdain of his brother , the thousand inconveniences to himself .-- Could it be ?-- No ; it was impossible . And yet it was far , very far , from impossible .-- Was it a new circumstance for a man of first - rate abilities to be captivated by very inferior powers ? Was it new for one , perhaps too busy to seek , to be the prize of a girl who would seek him ?-- Was it new for any thing in this world to be unequal , inconsistent , incongruous -- or for chance and circumstance ( as second causes ) to direct the human fate ? Oh !
austen#had she never brought Harriet forward ! Had she left her where she ought , and where he had told her she ought !-- Had she not , with a folly which no tongue could express , prevented her marrying the unexceptionable young man who would have made her happy and respectable in the line of life to which she ought to belong -- all would have been safe ; none of this dreadful sequel would have been . How Harriet could ever have had the presumption to raise her thoughts to Mr . Knightley !-- How she could dare to fancy herself the chosen of such a man till actually assured of it !-- But Harriet was less humble , had fewer scruples than formerly .-- Her inferiority , whether of mind or situation , seemed little felt .-- She had seemed more sensible of Mr . Elton ' s being to stoop in marrying her , than she now seemed of Mr . Knightley ' s .-- Alas ! was not that her own doing too ?
austen#Who had been at pains to give Harriet notions of self - consequence but herself ?-- Who but herself had taught her , that she was to elevate herself if possible , and that her claims were great to a high worldly establishment ?-- If Harriet , from being humble , were grown vain , it was her doing too . CHAPTER XII Till now that she was threatened with its loss , Emma had never known how much of her happiness depended on being _first_ with Mr . Knightley , first in interest and affection .-- Satisfied that it was so , and feeling it her due , she had enjoyed it without reflection ; and only in the dread of being supplanted , found how inexpressibly important it had been .-- Long , very long , she felt she had been first ; for , having no female connexions of his own , there had been only Isabella whose claims could be compared with hers , and she had always known exactly how far he loved and esteemed Isabella . She had herself been first with him for many years past . She had not deserved it ; she had often been negligent or perverse , slighting his advice , or even wilfully opposing him , insensible of half his merits , and quarrelling with him because he would not acknowledge her false and insolent estimate of her own -- but still , from family attachment and habit , and thorough excellence of mind , he had loved her , and watched over her from a girl , with an endeavour to improve her , and an anxiety for her doing right , which no other creature had at all shared . In spite of all her faults , she knew she was dear to him ; might she not say , very dear ?-- When the suggestions of hope , however , which must follow here , presented themselves , she could not presume to indulge them .
austen#Harriet Smith might think herself not unworthy of being peculiarly , exclusively , passionately loved by Mr . Knightley . _She_ could not . She could not flatter herself with any idea of blindness in his attachment to _her_ . She had received a very recent proof of its impartiality .-- How shocked had he been by her behaviour to Miss Bates ! How directly , how strongly had he expressed himself to her on the subject !-- Not too strongly for the offence -- but far , far too strongly to issue from any feeling softer than upright justice and clear - sighted goodwill .-- She had no hope , nothing to deserve the name of hope , that he could have that sort of affection for herself which was now in question ; but there was a hope ( at times a slight one , at times much stronger ,) that Harriet might have deceived herself , and be overrating his regard for _her_ .-- Wish it she must , for his sake -- be the consequence nothing to herself , but his remaining single all his life . Could she be secure of that , indeed , of his never marrying at all , she believed she should be perfectly satisfied .-- Let him but continue the same Mr . Knightley to her and her father , the same Mr . Knightley to all the world ; let Donwell and Hartfield lose none of their precious intercourse of friendship and confidence , and her peace would be fully secured .-- Marriage , in fact , would not do for her .
austen#It would be incompatible with what she owed to her father , and with what she felt for him . Nothing should separate her from her father . She would not marry , even if she were asked by Mr . Knightley . It must be her ardent wish that Harriet might be disappointed ; and she hoped , that when able to see them together again , she might at least be able to ascertain what the chances for it were .-- She should see them henceforward with the closest observance ; and wretchedly as she had hitherto misunderstood even those she was watching , she did not know how to admit that she could be blinded here .-- He was expected back every day . The power of observation would be soon given -- frightfully soon it appeared when her thoughts were in one course . In the meanwhile , she resolved against seeing Harriet .-- It would do neither of them good , it would do the subject no good , to be talking of it farther .-- She was resolved not to be convinced , as long as she could doubt , and yet had no authority for opposing Harriet ' s confidence .
austen#"To talk would be only to irritate .-- She wrote to her , therefore , kindly , but decisively , to beg that she would not , at present , come to Hartfield ; acknowledging it to be her conviction , that all farther confidential discussion of _one_ topic had better be avoided ; and hoping , that if a few days were allowed to pass before they met again , except in the company of others -- she objected only to a tete - a - tete -- they might be able to act as if they had forgotten the conversation of yesterday .-- Harriet submitted , and approved , and was grateful . This point was just arranged , when a visitor arrived to tear Emma ' s thoughts a little from the one subject which had engrossed them , sleeping or waking , the last twenty - four hours -- Mrs . Weston , who had been calling on her daughter - in - law elect , and took Hartfield in her way home , almost as much in duty to Emma as in pleasure to herself , to relate all the particulars of so interesting an interview . Mr . Weston had accompanied her to Mrs . Bates ' s , and gone through his share of this essential attention most handsomely ; but she having then induced Miss Fairfax to join her in an airing , was now returned with much more to say , and much more to say with satisfaction , than a quarter of an hour spent in Mrs . Bates ' s parlour , with all the encumbrance of awkward feelings , could have afforded . A little curiosity Emma had ; and she made the most of it while her friend related . Mrs . Weston had set off to pay the visit in a good deal of agitation herself ; and in the first place had wished not to go at all at present , to be allowed merely to write to Miss Fairfax instead , and to defer this ceremonious call till a little time had passed , and Mr . Churchill could be reconciled to the engagement ' s becoming known ; as , considering every thing , she thought such a visit could not be paid without leading to reports :-- but Mr . Weston had thought differently ; he was extremely anxious to shew his approbation to Miss Fairfax and her family , and did not conceive that any suspicion could be excited by it ; or if it were , that it would be of any consequence ; for "" such things ,"" he observed , "" always got about ."" Emma smiled , and felt that Mr . Weston had very good reason for saying so ."
austen#They had gone , in short -- and very great had been the evident distress and confusion of the lady . She had hardly been able to speak a word , and every look and action had shewn how deeply she was suffering from consciousness . The quiet , heart - felt satisfaction of the old lady , and the rapturous delight of her daughter -- who proved even too joyous to talk as usual , had been a gratifying , yet almost an affecting , scene . They were both so truly respectable in their happiness , so disinterested in every sensation ; thought so much of Jane ; so much of every body , and so little of themselves , that every kindly feeling was at work for them . Miss Fairfax ' s recent illness had offered a fair plea for Mrs . Weston to invite her to an airing ; she had drawn back and declined at first , but , on being pressed had yielded ; and , in the course of their drive , Mrs . Weston had , by gentle encouragement , overcome so much of her embarrassment , as to bring her to converse on the important subject . Apologies for her seemingly ungracious silence in their first reception , and the warmest expressions of the gratitude she was always feeling towards herself and Mr . Weston , must necessarily open the cause ; but when these effusions were put by , they had talked a good deal of the present and of the future state of the engagement .
austen#"Mrs . Weston was convinced that such conversation must be the greatest relief to her companion , pent up within her own mind as every thing had so long been , and was very much pleased with all that she had said on the subject . "" On the misery of what she had suffered , during the concealment of so many months ,"" continued Mrs . Weston , "" she was energetic . This was one of her expressions . ` I will not say , that since I entered into the engagement I have not had some happy moments ; but I can say , that I have never known the blessing of one tranquil hour :'-- and the quivering lip , Emma , which uttered it , was an attestation that I felt at my heart ."" "" Poor girl !"" said Emma ."
austen#""" She thinks herself wrong , then , for having consented to a private engagement ?"" "" Wrong ! No one , I believe , can blame her more than she is disposed to blame herself . ` The consequence ,' said she , ` has been a state of perpetual suffering to me ; and so it ought . But after all the punishment that misconduct can bring , it is still not less misconduct . Pain is no expiation ."
austen#"I never can be blameless . I have been acting contrary to all my sense of right ; and the fortunate turn that every thing has taken , and the kindness I am now receiving , is what my conscience tells me ought not to be .' ` Do not imagine , madam ,' she continued , ` that I was taught wrong . Do not let any reflection fall on the principles or the care of the friends who brought me up . The error has been all my own ; and I do assure you that , with all the excuse that present circumstances may appear to give , I shall yet dread making the story known to Colonel Campbell .'"" "" Poor girl !"""
austen#"said Emma again . "" She loves him then excessively , I suppose . It must have been from attachment only , that she could be led to form the engagement . Her affection must have overpowered her judgment ."" "" Yes , I have no doubt of her being extremely attached to him ."" "" I am afraid ,"" returned Emma , sighing , "" that I must often have contributed to make her unhappy ."""
austen#""" On your side , my love , it was very innocently done . But she probably had something of that in her thoughts , when alluding to the misunderstandings which he had given us hints of before . One natural consequence of the evil she had involved herself in ,"" she said , "" was that of making her _unreasonable_ . The consciousness of having done amiss , had exposed her to a thousand inquietudes , and made her captious and irritable to a degree that must have been -- that had been -- hard for him to bear . ` I did not make the allowances ,' said she , ` which I ought to have done , for his temper and spirits -- his delightful spirits , and that gaiety , that playfulness of disposition , which , under any other circumstances , would , I am sure , have been as constantly bewitching to me , as they were at first .' She then began to speak of you , and of the great kindness you had shewn her during her illness ; and with a blush which shewed me how it was all connected , desired me , whenever I had an opportunity , to thank you -- I could not thank you too much -- for every wish and every endeavour to do her good ."
austen#"She was sensible that you had never received any proper acknowledgment from herself ."" "" If I did not know her to be happy now ,"" said Emma , seriously , "" which , in spite of every little drawback from her scrupulous conscience , she must be , I could not bear these thanks ;-- for , oh ! Mrs . Weston , if there were an account drawn up of the evil and the good I have done Miss Fairfax !-- Well ( checking herself , and trying to be more lively ), this is all to be forgotten . You are very kind to bring me these interesting particulars . They shew her to the greatest advantage . I am sure she is very good -- I hope she will be very happy ."
austen#"It is fit that the fortune should be on his side , for I think the merit will be all on hers ."" Such a conclusion could not pass unanswered by Mrs . Weston . She thought well of Frank in almost every respect ; and , what was more , she loved him very much , and her defence was , therefore , earnest . She talked with a great deal of reason , and at least equal affection -- but she had too much to urge for Emma ' s attention ; it was soon gone to Brunswick Square or to Donwell ; she forgot to attempt to listen ; and when Mrs . Weston ended with , "" We have not yet had the letter we are so anxious for , you know , but I hope it will soon come ,"" she was obliged to pause before she answered , and at last obliged to answer at random , before she could at all recollect what letter it was which they were so anxious for . "" Are you well , my Emma ?"" was Mrs . Weston ' s parting question ."
austen#""" Oh ! perfectly . I am always well , you know . Be sure to give me intelligence of the letter as soon as possible ."" Mrs . Weston ' s communications furnished Emma with more food for unpleasant reflection , by increasing her esteem and compassion , and her sense of past injustice towards Miss Fairfax . She bitterly regretted not having sought a closer acquaintance with her , and blushed for the envious feelings which had certainly been , in some measure , the cause ."
austen#Had she followed Mr . Knightley ' s known wishes , in paying that attention to Miss Fairfax , which was every way her due ; had she tried to know her better ; had she done her part towards intimacy ; had she endeavoured to find a friend there instead of in Harriet Smith ; she must , in all probability , have been spared from every pain which pressed on her now .-- Birth , abilities , and education , had been equally marking one as an associate for her , to be received with gratitude ; and the other -- what was she ?-- Supposing even that they had never become intimate friends ; that she had never been admitted into Miss Fairfax ' s confidence on this important matter -- which was most probable -- still , in knowing her as she ought , and as she might , she must have been preserved from the abominable suspicions of an improper attachment to Mr . Dixon , which she had not only so foolishly fashioned and harboured herself , but had so unpardonably imparted ; an idea which she greatly feared had been made a subject of material distress to the delicacy of Jane ' s feelings , by the levity or carelessness of Frank Churchill ' s . Of all the sources of evil surrounding the former , since her coming to Highbury , she was persuaded that she must herself have been the worst . She must have been a perpetual enemy . They never could have been all three together , without her having stabbed Jane Fairfax ' s peace in a thousand instances ; and on Box Hill , perhaps , it had been the agony of a mind that would bear no more . The evening of this day was very long , and melancholy , at Hartfield . The weather added what it could of gloom .
austen#A cold stormy rain set in , and nothing of July appeared but in the trees and shrubs , which the wind was despoiling , and the length of the day , which only made such cruel sights the longer visible . The weather affected Mr . Woodhouse , and he could only be kept tolerably comfortable by almost ceaseless attention on his daughter ' s side , and by exertions which had never cost her half so much before . It reminded her of their first forlorn tete - a - tete , on the evening of Mrs . Weston ' s wedding - day ; but Mr . Knightley had walked in then , soon after tea , and dissipated every melancholy fancy . Alas ! such delightful proofs of Hartfield ' s attraction , as those sort of visits conveyed , might shortly be over . The picture which she had then drawn of the privations of the approaching winter , had proved erroneous ; no friends had deserted them , no pleasures had been lost .-- But her present forebodings she feared would experience no similar contradiction .
austen#The prospect before her now , was threatening to a degree that could not be entirely dispelled -- that might not be even partially brightened . If all took place that might take place among the circle of her friends , Hartfield must be comparatively deserted ; and she left to cheer her father with the spirits only of ruined happiness . The child to be born at Randalls must be a tie there even dearer than herself ; and Mrs . Weston ' s heart and time would be occupied by it . They should lose her ; and , probably , in great measure , her husband also .-- Frank Churchill would return among them no more ; and Miss Fairfax , it was reasonable to suppose , would soon cease to belong to Highbury . They would be married , and settled either at or near Enscombe . All that were good would be withdrawn ; and if to these losses , the loss of Donwell were to be added , what would remain of cheerful or of rational society within their reach ?
austen#Mr . Knightley to be no longer coming there for his evening comfort !-- No longer walking in at all hours , as if ever willing to change his own home for their ' s !-- How was it to be endured ? And if he were to be lost to them for Harriet ' s sake ; if he were to be thought of hereafter , as finding in Harriet ' s society all that he wanted ; if Harriet were to be the chosen , the first , the dearest , the friend , the wife to whom he looked for all the best blessings of existence ; what could be increasing Emma ' s wretchedness but the reflection never far distant from her mind , that it had been all her own work ? When it came to such a pitch as this , she was not able to refrain from a start , or a heavy sigh , or even from walking about the room for a few seconds -- and the only source whence any thing like consolation or composure could be drawn , was in the resolution of her own better conduct , and the hope that , however inferior in spirit and gaiety might be the following and every future winter of her life to the past , it would yet find her more rational , more acquainted with herself , and leave her less to regret when it were gone . CHAPTER XIII The weather continued much the same all the following morning ; and the same loneliness , and the same melancholy , seemed to reign at Hartfield -- but in the afternoon it cleared ; the wind changed into a softer quarter ; the clouds were carried off ; the sun appeared ; it was summer again . With all the eagerness which such a transition gives , Emma resolved to be out of doors as soon as possible .
austen#"Never had the exquisite sight , smell , sensation of nature , tranquil , warm , and brilliant after a storm , been more attractive to her . She longed for the serenity they might gradually introduce ; and on Mr . Perry ' s coming in soon after dinner , with a disengaged hour to give her father , she lost no time ill hurrying into the shrubbery .-- There , with spirits freshened , and thoughts a little relieved , she had taken a few turns , when she saw Mr . Knightley passing through the garden door , and coming towards her .-- It was the first intimation of his being returned from London . She had been thinking of him the moment before , as unquestionably sixteen miles distant .-- There was time only for the quickest arrangement of mind . She must be collected and calm . In half a minute they were together . The "" How d ' ye do ' s "" were quiet and constrained on each side ."
austen#"She asked after their mutual friends ; they were all well .-- When had he left them ?-- Only that morning . He must have had a wet ride .-- Yes .-- He meant to walk with her , she found . "" He had just looked into the dining - room , and as he was not wanted there , preferred being out of doors ."" -- She thought he neither looked nor spoke cheerfully ; and the first possible cause for it , suggested by her fears , was , that he had perhaps been communicating his plans to his brother , and was pained by the manner in which they had been received . They walked together . He was silent ."
austen#She thought he was often looking at her , and trying for a fuller view of her face than it suited her to give . And this belief produced another dread . Perhaps he wanted to speak to her , of his attachment to Harriet ; he might be watching for encouragement to begin .-- She did not , could not , feel equal to lead the way to any such subject . He must do it all himself . Yet she could not bear this silence . With him it was most unnatural .
austen#"She considered -- resolved -- and , trying to smile , began -- "" You have some news to hear , now you are come back , that will rather surprize you ."" "" Have I ?"" said he quietly , and looking at her ; "" of what nature ?"" "" Oh ! the best nature in the world -- a wedding ."""
austen#"After waiting a moment , as if to be sure she intended to say no more , he replied , "" If you mean Miss Fairfax and Frank Churchill , I have heard that already ."" "" How is it possible ?"" cried Emma , turning her glowing cheeks towards him ; for , while she spoke , it occurred to her that he might have called at Mrs . Goddard ' s in his way . "" I had a few lines on parish business from Mr . Weston this morning , and at the end of them he gave me a brief account of what had happened ."" Emma was quite relieved , and could presently say , with a little more composure ,"
austen#""" _You_ probably have been less surprized than any of us , for you have had your suspicions .-- I have not forgotten that you once tried to give me a caution .-- I wish I had attended to it -- but --( with a sinking voice and a heavy sigh ) I seem to have been doomed to blindness ."" For a moment or two nothing was said , and she was unsuspicious of having excited any particular interest , till she found her arm drawn within his , and pressed against his heart , and heard him thus saying , in a tone of great sensibility , speaking low , "" Time , my dearest Emma , time will heal the wound .-- Your own excellent sense -- your exertions for your father ' s sake -- I know you will not allow yourself --."" Her arm was pressed again , as he added , in a more broken and subdued accent , "" The feelings of the warmest friendship -- Indignation -- Abominable scoundrel !"" -- And in a louder , steadier tone , he concluded with , "" He will soon be gone . They will soon be in Yorkshire ."
austen#"I am sorry for _her_ . She deserves a better fate ."" Emma understood him ; and as soon as she could recover from the flutter of pleasure , excited by such tender consideration , replied , "" You are very kind -- but you are mistaken -- and I must set you right .-- I am not in want of that sort of compassion . My blindness to what was going on , led me to act by them in a way that I must always be ashamed of , and I was very foolishly tempted to say and do many things which may well lay me open to unpleasant conjectures , but I have no other reason to regret that I was not in the secret earlier ."" "" Emma !"""
austen#"cried he , looking eagerly at her , "" are you , indeed ?"" -- but checking himself --"" No , no , I understand you -- forgive me -- I am pleased that you can say even so much .-- He is no object of regret , indeed ! and it will not be very long , I hope , before that becomes the acknowledgment of more than your reason .-- Fortunate that your affections were not farther entangled !-- I could never , I confess , from your manners , assure myself as to the degree of what you felt -- I could only be certain that there was a preference -- and a preference which I never believed him to deserve .-- He is a disgrace to the name of man .-- And is he to be rewarded with that sweet young woman ?-- Jane , Jane , you will be a miserable creature ."" "" Mr . Knightley ,"" said Emma , trying to be lively , but really confused -- "" I am in a very extraordinary situation . I cannot let you continue in your error ; and yet , perhaps , since my manners gave such an impression , I have as much reason to be ashamed of confessing that I never have been at all attached to the person we are speaking of , as it might be natural for a woman to feel in confessing exactly the reverse .-- But I never have ."" He listened in perfect silence ."
austen#"She wished him to speak , but he would not . She supposed she must say more before she were entitled to his clemency ; but it was a hard case to be obliged still to lower herself in his opinion . She went on , however . "" I have very little to say for my own conduct .-- I was tempted by his attentions , and allowed myself to appear pleased .-- An old story , probably -- a common case -- and no more than has happened to hundreds of my sex before ; and yet it may not be the more excusable in one who sets up as I do for Understanding . Many circumstances assisted the temptation . He was the son of Mr . Weston -- he was continually here -- I always found him very pleasant -- and , in short , for ( with a sigh ) let me swell out the causes ever so ingeniously , they all centre in this at last -- my vanity was flattered , and I allowed his attentions ."
austen#"Latterly , however -- for some time , indeed -- I have had no idea of their meaning any thing .-- I thought them a habit , a trick , nothing that called for seriousness on my side . He has imposed on me , but he has not injured me . I have never been attached to him . And now I can tolerably comprehend his behaviour . He never wished to attach me . It was merely a blind to conceal his real situation with another .-- It was his object to blind all about him ; and no one , I am sure , could be more effectually blinded than myself -- except that I was _not_ blinded -- that it was my good fortune -- that , in short , I was somehow or other safe from him ."""
austen#"She had hoped for an answer here -- for a few words to say that her conduct was at least intelligible ; but he was silent ; and , as far as she could judge , deep in thought . At last , and tolerably in his usual tone , he said , "" I have never had a high opinion of Frank Churchill .-- I can suppose , however , that I may have underrated him . My acquaintance with him has been but trifling .-- And even if I have not underrated him hitherto , he may yet turn out well .-- With such a woman he has a chance .-- I have no motive for wishing him ill -- and for her sake , whose happiness will be involved in his good character and conduct , I shall certainly wish him well ."" "" I have no doubt of their being happy together ,"" said Emma ; "" I believe them to be very mutually and very sincerely attached ."" "" He is a most fortunate man !"""
austen#"returned Mr . Knightley , with energy . "" So early in life -- at three - and - twenty -- a period when , if a man chuses a wife , he generally chuses ill . At three - and - twenty to have drawn such a prize ! What years of felicity that man , in all human calculation , has before him !-- Assured of the love of such a woman -- the disinterested love , for Jane Fairfax ' s character vouches for her disinterestedness ; every thing in his favour ,-- equality of situation -- I mean , as far as regards society , and all the habits and manners that are important ; equality in every point but one -- and that one , since the purity of her heart is not to be doubted , such as must increase his felicity , for it will be his to bestow the only advantages she wants .-- A man would always wish to give a woman a better home than the one he takes her from ; and he who can do it , where there is no doubt of _her_ regard , must , I think , be the happiest of mortals .-- Frank Churchill is , indeed , the favourite of fortune . Every thing turns out for his good .-- He meets with a young woman at a watering - place , gains her affection , cannot even weary her by negligent treatment -- and had he and all his family sought round the world for a perfect wife for him , they could not have found her superior .-- His aunt is in the way .-- His aunt dies .-- He has only to speak .-- His friends are eager to promote his happiness .-- He had used every body ill -- and they are all delighted to forgive him .-- He is a fortunate man indeed !"" "" You speak as if you envied him ."" "" And I do envy him , Emma ."
austen#"In one respect he is the object of my envy ."" Emma could say no more . They seemed to be within half a sentence of Harriet , and her immediate feeling was to avert the subject , if possible . She made her plan ; she would speak of something totally different -- the children in Brunswick Square ; and she only waited for breath to begin , when Mr . Knightley startled her , by saying , "" You will not ask me what is the point of envy .-- You are determined , I see , to have no curiosity .-- You are wise -- but _I_ cannot be wise . Emma , I must tell you what you will not ask , though I may wish it unsaid the next moment ."""
austen#""" Oh ! then , don ' t speak it , don ' t speak it ,"" she eagerly cried . "" Take a little time , consider , do not commit yourself ."" "" Thank you ,"" said he , in an accent of deep mortification , and not another syllable followed . Emma could not bear to give him pain . He was wishing to confide in her -- perhaps to consult her ;-- cost her what it would , she would listen ."
austen#"She might assist his resolution , or reconcile him to it ; she might give just praise to Harriet , or , by representing to him his own independence , relieve him from that state of indecision , which must be more intolerable than any alternative to such a mind as his .-- They had reached the house . "" You are going in , I suppose ?"" said he . "" No ,""-- replied Emma -- quite confirmed by the depressed manner in which he still spoke --"" I should like to take another turn . Mr . Perry is not gone ."" And , after proceeding a few steps , she added -- "" I stopped you ungraciously , just now , Mr . Knightley , and , I am afraid , gave you pain .-- But if you have any wish to speak openly to me as a friend , or to ask my opinion of any thing that you may have in contemplation -- as a friend , indeed , you may command me .-- I will hear whatever you like ."
austen#"I will tell you exactly what I think ."" "" As a friend !"" -- repeated Mr . Knightley .--"" Emma , that I fear is a word -- No , I have no wish -- Stay , yes , why should I hesitate ?-- I have gone too far already for concealment .-- Emma , I accept your offer -- Extraordinary as it may seem , I accept it , and refer myself to you as a friend .-- Tell me , then , have I no chance of ever succeeding ?"" He stopped in his earnestness to look the question , and the expression of his eyes overpowered her . "" My dearest Emma ,"" said he , "" for dearest you will always be , whatever the event of this hour ' s conversation , my dearest , most beloved Emma -- tell me at once ."
austen#"Say ` No ,' if it is to be said ."" -- She could really say nothing .--"" You are silent ,"" he cried , with great animation ; "" absolutely silent ! at present I ask no more ."" Emma was almost ready to sink under the agitation of this moment . The dread of being awakened from the happiest dream , was perhaps the most prominent feeling . "" I cannot make speeches , Emma :"" he soon resumed ; and in a tone of such sincere , decided , intelligible tenderness as was tolerably convincing .--"" If I loved you less , I might be able to talk about it more ."
austen#"But you know what I am .-- You hear nothing but truth from me .-- I have blamed you , and lectured you , and you have borne it as no other woman in England would have borne it .-- Bear with the truths I would tell you now , dearest Emma , as well as you have borne with them . The manner , perhaps , may have as little to recommend them . God knows , I have been a very indifferent lover .-- But you understand me .-- Yes , you see , you understand my feelings -- and will return them if you can . At present , I ask only to hear , once to hear your voice ."" While he spoke , Emma ' s mind was most busy , and , with all the wonderful velocity of thought , had been able -- and yet without losing a word -- to catch and comprehend the exact truth of the whole ; to see that Harriet ' s hopes had been entirely groundless , a mistake , a delusion , as complete a delusion as any of her own -- that Harriet was nothing ; that she was every thing herself ; that what she had been saying relative to Harriet had been all taken as the language of her own feelings ; and that her agitation , her doubts , her reluctance , her discouragement , had been all received as discouragement from herself .-- And not only was there time for these convictions , with all their glow of attendant happiness ; there was time also to rejoice that Harriet ' s secret had not escaped her , and to resolve that it need not , and should not .-- It was all the service she could now render her poor friend ; for as to any of that heroism of sentiment which might have prompted her to entreat him to transfer his affection from herself to Harriet , as infinitely the most worthy of the two -- or even the more simple sublimity of resolving to refuse him at once and for ever , without vouchsafing any motive , because he could not marry them both , Emma had it not . She felt for Harriet , with pain and with contrition ; but no flight of generosity run mad , opposing all that could be probable or reasonable , entered her brain ."
austen#She had led her friend astray , and it would be a reproach to her for ever ; but her judgment was as strong as her feelings , and as strong as it had ever been before , in reprobating any such alliance for him , as most unequal and degrading . Her way was clear , though not quite smooth .-- She spoke then , on being so entreated .-- What did she say ?-- Just what she ought , of course . A lady always does .-- She said enough to shew there need not be despair -- and to invite him to say more himself . He _had_ despaired at one period ; he had received such an injunction to caution and silence , as for the time crushed every hope ;-- she had begun by refusing to hear him .-- The change had perhaps been somewhat sudden ;-- her proposal of taking another turn , her renewing the conversation which she had just put an end to , might be a little extraordinary !-- She felt its inconsistency ; but Mr . Knightley was so obliging as to put up with it , and seek no farther explanation . Seldom , very seldom , does complete truth belong to any human disclosure ; seldom can it happen that something is not a little disguised , or a little mistaken ; but where , as in this case , though the conduct is mistaken , the feelings are not , it may not be very material .-- Mr . Knightley could not impute to Emma a more relenting heart than she possessed , or a heart more disposed to accept of his . He had , in fact , been wholly unsuspicious of his own influence .
austen#He had followed her into the shrubbery with no idea of trying it . He had come , in his anxiety to see how she bore Frank Churchill ' s engagement , with no selfish view , no view at all , but of endeavouring , if she allowed him an opening , to soothe or to counsel her .-- The rest had been the work of the moment , the immediate effect of what he heard , on his feelings . The delightful assurance of her total indifference towards Frank Churchill , of her having a heart completely disengaged from him , had given birth to the hope , that , in time , he might gain her affection himself ;-- but it had been no present hope -- he had only , in the momentary conquest of eagerness over judgment , aspired to be told that she did not forbid his attempt to attach her .-- The superior hopes which gradually opened were so much the more enchanting .-- The affection , which he had been asking to be allowed to create , if he could , was already his !-- Within half an hour , he had passed from a thoroughly distressed state of mind , to something so like perfect happiness , that it could bear no other name . _Her_ change was equal .-- This one half - hour had given to each the same precious certainty of being beloved , had cleared from each the same degree of ignorance , jealousy , or distrust .-- On his side , there had been a long - standing jealousy , old as the arrival , or even the expectation , of Frank Churchill .-- He had been in love with Emma , and jealous of Frank Churchill , from about the same period , one sentiment having probably enlightened him as to the other . It was his jealousy of Frank Churchill that had taken him from the country .-- The Box Hill party had decided him on going away . He would save himself from witnessing again such permitted , encouraged attentions .-- He had gone to learn to be indifferent .-- But he had gone to a wrong place .
austen#There was too much domestic happiness in his brother ' s house ; woman wore too amiable a form in it ; Isabella was too much like Emma -- differing only in those striking inferiorities , which always brought the other in brilliancy before him , for much to have been done , even had his time been longer .-- He had stayed on , however , vigorously , day after day -- till this very morning ' s post had conveyed the history of Jane Fairfax .-- Then , with the gladness which must be felt , nay , which he did not scruple to feel , having never believed Frank Churchill to be at all deserving Emma , was there so much fond solicitude , so much keen anxiety for her , that he could stay no longer . He had ridden home through the rain ; and had walked up directly after dinner , to see how this sweetest and best of all creatures , faultless in spite of all her faults , bore the discovery . He had found her agitated and low .-- Frank Churchill was a villain .-- He heard her declare that she had never loved him . Frank Churchill ' s character was not desperate .-- She was his own Emma , by hand and word , when they returned into the house ; and if he could have thought of Frank Churchill then , he might have deemed him a very good sort of fellow . CHAPTER XIV What totally different feelings did Emma take back into the house from what she had brought out !-- she had then been only daring to hope for a little respite of suffering ;-- she was now in an exquisite flutter of happiness , and such happiness moreover as she believed must still be greater when the flutter should have passed away .
austen#They sat down to tea -- the same party round the same table -- how often it had been collected !-- and how often had her eyes fallen on the same shrubs in the lawn , and observed the same beautiful effect of the western sun !-- But never in such a state of spirits , never in any thing like it ; and it was with difficulty that she could summon enough of her usual self to be the attentive lady of the house , or even the attentive daughter . Poor Mr . Woodhouse little suspected what was plotting against him in the breast of that man whom he was so cordially welcoming , and so anxiously hoping might not have taken cold from his ride .-- Could he have seen the heart , he would have cared very little for the lungs ; but without the most distant imagination of the impending evil , without the slightest perception of any thing extraordinary in the looks or ways of either , he repeated to them very comfortably all the articles of news he had received from Mr . Perry , and talked on with much self - contentment , totally unsuspicious of what they could have told him in return . As long as Mr . Knightley remained with them , Emma ' s fever continued ; but when he was gone , she began to be a little tranquillised and subdued -- and in the course of the sleepless night , which was the tax for such an evening , she found one or two such very serious points to consider , as made her feel , that even her happiness must have some alloy . Her father -- and Harriet . She could not be alone without feeling the full weight of their separate claims ; and how to guard the comfort of both to the utmost , was the question . With respect to her father , it was a question soon answered .
austen#"She hardly knew yet what Mr . Knightley would ask ; but a very short parley with her own heart produced the most solemn resolution of never quitting her father .-- She even wept over the idea of it , as a sin of thought . While he lived , it must be only an engagement ; but she flattered herself , that if divested of the danger of drawing her away , it might become an increase of comfort to him .-- How to do her best by Harriet , was of more difficult decision ;-- how to spare her from any unnecessary pain ; how to make her any possible atonement ; how to appear least her enemy ?-- On these subjects , her perplexity and distress were very great -- and her mind had to pass again and again through every bitter reproach and sorrowful regret that had ever surrounded it .-- She could only resolve at last , that she would still avoid a meeting with her , and communicate all that need be told by letter ; that it would be inexpressibly desirable to have her removed just now for a time from Highbury , and -- indulging in one scheme more -- nearly resolve , that it might be practicable to get an invitation for her to Brunswick Square .-- Isabella had been pleased with Harriet ; and a few weeks spent in London must give her some amusement .-- She did not think it in Harriet ' s nature to escape being benefited by novelty and variety , by the streets , the shops , and the children .-- At any rate , it would be a proof of attention and kindness in herself , from whom every thing was due ; a separation for the present ; an averting of the evil day , when they must all be together again . She rose early , and wrote her letter to Harriet ; an employment which left her so very serious , so nearly sad , that Mr . Knightley , in walking up to Hartfield to breakfast , did not arrive at all too soon ; and half an hour stolen afterwards to go over the same ground again with him , literally and figuratively , was quite necessary to reinstate her in a proper share of the happiness of the evening before . He had not left her long , by no means long enough for her to have the slightest inclination for thinking of any body else , when a letter was brought her from Randalls -- a very thick letter ;-- she guessed what it must contain , and deprecated the necessity of reading it .-- She was now in perfect charity with Frank Churchill ; she wanted no explanations , she wanted only to have her thoughts to herself -- and as for understanding any thing he wrote , she was sure she was incapable of it .-- It must be waded through , however . She opened the packet ; it was too surely so ;-- a note from Mrs . Weston to herself , ushered in the letter from Frank to Mrs . Weston . "" I have the greatest pleasure , my dear Emma , in forwarding to you the enclosed ."
austen#"I know what thorough justice you will do it , and have scarcely a doubt of its happy effect .-- I think we shall never materially disagree about the writer again ; but I will not delay you by a long preface .-- We are quite well .-- This letter has been the cure of all the little nervousness I have been feeling lately .-- I did not quite like your looks on Tuesday , but it was an ungenial morning ; and though you will never own being affected by weather , I think every body feels a north - east wind .-- I felt for your dear father very much in the storm of Tuesday afternoon and yesterday morning , but had the comfort of hearing last night , by Mr . Perry , that it had not made him ill . "" Yours ever , "" A . W ."" [ To Mrs . Weston .] WINDSOR - JULY . MY DEAR MADAM , "" If I made myself intelligible yesterday , this letter will be expected ; but expected or not , I know it will be read with candour and indulgence .-- You are all goodness , and I believe there will be need of even all your goodness to allow for some parts of my past conduct .-- But I have been forgiven by one who had still more to resent ."
austen#My courage rises while I write . It is very difficult for the prosperous to be humble . I have already met with such success in two applications for pardon , that I may be in danger of thinking myself too sure of yours , and of those among your friends who have had any ground of offence .-- You must all endeavour to comprehend the exact nature of my situation when I first arrived at Randalls ; you must consider me as having a secret which was to be kept at all hazards . This was the fact . My right to place myself in a situation requiring such concealment , is another question . I shall not discuss it here .
austen#For my temptation to _think_ it a right , I refer every caviller to a brick house , sashed windows below , and casements above , in Highbury . I dared not address her openly ; my difficulties in the then state of Enscombe must be too well known to require definition ; and I was fortunate enough to prevail , before we parted at Weymouth , and to induce the most upright female mind in the creation to stoop in charity to a secret engagement .-- Had she refused , I should have gone mad .-- But you will be ready to say , what was your hope in doing this ?-- What did you look forward to ?-- To any thing , every thing -- to time , chance , circumstance , slow effects , sudden bursts , perseverance and weariness , health and sickness . Every possibility of good was before me , and the first of blessings secured , in obtaining her promises of faith and correspondence . If you need farther explanation , I have the honour , my dear madam , of being your husband ' s son , and the advantage of inheriting a disposition to hope for good , which no inheritance of houses or lands can ever equal the value of .-- See me , then , under these circumstances , arriving on my first visit to Randalls ;-- and here I am conscious of wrong , for that visit might have been sooner paid . You will look back and see that I did not come till Miss Fairfax was in Highbury ; and as _you_ were the person slighted , you will forgive me instantly ; but I must work on my father ' s compassion , by reminding him , that so long as I absented myself from his house , so long I lost the blessing of knowing you . My behaviour , during the very happy fortnight which I spent with you , did not , I hope , lay me open to reprehension , excepting on one point .
austen#And now I come to the principal , the only important part of my conduct while belonging to you , which excites my own anxiety , or requires very solicitous explanation . With the greatest respect , and the warmest friendship , do I mention Miss Woodhouse ; my father perhaps will think I ought to add , with the deepest humiliation .-- A few words which dropped from him yesterday spoke his opinion , and some censure I acknowledge myself liable to .-- My behaviour to Miss Woodhouse indicated , I believe , more than it ought .-- In order to assist a concealment so essential to me , I was led on to make more than an allowable use of the sort of intimacy into which we were immediately thrown .-- I cannot deny that Miss Woodhouse was my ostensible object -- but I am sure you will believe the declaration , that had I not been convinced of her indifference , I would not have been induced by any selfish views to go on .-- Amiable and delightful as Miss Woodhouse is , she never gave me the idea of a young woman likely to be attached ; and that she was perfectly free from any tendency to being attached to me , was as much my conviction as my wish .-- She received my attentions with an easy , friendly , goodhumoured playfulness , which exactly suited me . We seemed to understand each other . From our relative situation , those attentions were her due , and were felt to be so .-- Whether Miss Woodhouse began really to understand me before the expiration of that fortnight , I cannot say ;-- when I called to take leave of her , I remember that I was within a moment of confessing the truth , and I then fancied she was not without suspicion ; but I have no doubt of her having since detected me , at least in some degree .-- She may not have surmised the whole , but her quickness must have penetrated a part . I cannot doubt it . You will find , whenever the subject becomes freed from its present restraints , that it did not take her wholly by surprize .
austen#She frequently gave me hints of it . I remember her telling me at the ball , that I owed Mrs . Elton gratitude for her attentions to Miss Fairfax .-- I hope this history of my conduct towards her will be admitted by you and my father as great extenuation of what you saw amiss . While you considered me as having sinned against Emma Woodhouse , I could deserve nothing from either . Acquit me here , and procure for me , when it is allowable , the acquittal and good wishes of that said Emma Woodhouse , whom I regard with so much brotherly affection , as to long to have her as deeply and as happily in love as myself .-- Whatever strange things I said or did during that fortnight , you have now a key to . My heart was in Highbury , and my business was to get my body thither as often as might be , and with the least suspicion . If you remember any queernesses , set them all to the right account .-- Of the pianoforte so much talked of , I feel it only necessary to say , that its being ordered was absolutely unknown to Miss F --, who would never have allowed me to send it , had any choice been given her .-- The delicacy of her mind throughout the whole engagement , my dear madam , is much beyond my power of doing justice to .
austen#You will soon , I earnestly hope , know her thoroughly yourself .-- No description can describe her . She must tell you herself what she is -- yet not by word , for never was there a human creature who would so designedly suppress her own merit .-- Since I began this letter , which will be longer than I foresaw , I have heard from her .-- She gives a good account of her own health ; but as she never complains , I dare not depend . I want to have your opinion of her looks . I know you will soon call on her ; she is living in dread of the visit . Perhaps it is paid already . Let me hear from you without delay ; I am impatient for a thousand particulars .
austen#Remember how few minutes I was at Randalls , and in how bewildered , how mad a state : and I am not much better yet ; still insane either from happiness or misery . When I think of the kindness and favour I have met with , of her excellence and patience , and my uncle ' s generosity , I am mad with joy : but when I recollect all the uneasiness I occasioned her , and how little I deserve to be forgiven , I am mad with anger . If I could but see her again !-- But I must not propose it yet . My uncle has been too good for me to encroach .-- I must still add to this long letter . You have not heard all that you ought to hear . I could not give any connected detail yesterday ; but the suddenness , and , in one light , the unseasonableness with which the affair burst out , needs explanation ; for though the event of the 26th ult ., as you will conclude , immediately opened to me the happiest prospects , I should not have presumed on such early measures , but from the very particular circumstances , which left me not an hour to lose .
austen#I should myself have shrunk from any thing so hasty , and she would have felt every scruple of mine with multiplied strength and refinement .-- But I had no choice . The hasty engagement she had entered into with that woman -- Here , my dear madam , I was obliged to leave off abruptly , to recollect and compose myself .-- I have been walking over the country , and am now , I hope , rational enough to make the rest of my letter what it ought to be .-- It is , in fact , a most mortifying retrospect for me . I behaved shamefully . And here I can admit , that my manners to Miss W ., in being unpleasant to Miss F ., were highly blameable . _She_ disapproved them , which ought to have been enough .-- My plea of concealing the truth she did not think sufficient .-- She was displeased ; I thought unreasonably so : I thought her , on a thousand occasions , unnecessarily scrupulous and cautious : I thought her even cold . But she was always right .
austen#If I had followed her judgment , and subdued my spirits to the level of what she deemed proper , I should have escaped the greatest unhappiness I have ever known .-- We quarrelled .-- Do you remember the morning spent at Donwell ?-- _There_ every little dissatisfaction that had occurred before came to a crisis . I was late ; I met her walking home by herself , and wanted to walk with her , but she would not suffer it . She absolutely refused to allow me , which I then thought most unreasonable . Now , however , I see nothing in it but a very natural and consistent degree of discretion . While I , to blind the world to our engagement , was behaving one hour with objectionable particularity to another woman , was she to be consenting the next to a proposal which might have made every previous caution useless ?-- Had we been met walking together between Donwell and Highbury , the truth must have been suspected .-- I was mad enough , however , to resent .-- I doubted her affection . I doubted it more the next day on Box Hill ; when , provoked by such conduct on my side , such shameful , insolent neglect of her , and such apparent devotion to Miss W ., as it would have been impossible for any woman of sense to endure , she spoke her resentment in a form of words perfectly intelligible to me .-- In short , my dear madam , it was a quarrel blameless on her side , abominable on mine ; and I returned the same evening to Richmond , though I might have staid with you till the next morning , merely because I would be as angry with her as possible .
austen#Even then , I was not such a fool as not to mean to be reconciled in time ; but I was the injured person , injured by her coldness , and I went away determined that she should make the first advances .-- I shall always congratulate myself that you were not of the Box Hill party . Had you witnessed my behaviour there , I can hardly suppose you would ever have thought well of me again . Its effect upon her appears in the immediate resolution it produced : as soon as she found I was really gone from Randalls , she closed with the offer of that officious Mrs . Elton ; the whole system of whose treatment of her , by the bye , has ever filled me with indignation and hatred . I must not quarrel with a spirit of forbearance which has been so richly extended towards myself ; but , otherwise , I should loudly protest against the share of it which that woman has known .-- ` Jane ,' indeed !-- You will observe that I have not yet indulged myself in calling her by that name , even to you . Think , then , what I must have endured in hearing it bandied between the Eltons with all the vulgarity of needless repetition , and all the insolence of imaginary superiority . Have patience with me , I shall soon have done .-- She closed with this offer , resolving to break with me entirely , and wrote the next day to tell me that we never were to meet again .-- _She_ _felt_ _the_ _engagement_ _to_ _be_ _a_ _source_ _of_ _repentance_ _and_ _misery_ _to_ _each_ : _she_ _dissolved_ _it_ .-- This letter reached me on the very morning of my poor aunt ' s death .
austen#I answered it within an hour ; but from the confusion of my mind , and the multiplicity of business falling on me at once , my answer , instead of being sent with all the many other letters of that day , was locked up in my writing - desk ; and I , trusting that I had written enough , though but a few lines , to satisfy her , remained without any uneasiness .-- I was rather disappointed that I did not hear from her again speedily ; but I made excuses for her , and was too busy , and -- may I add ?-- too cheerful in my views to be captious .-- We removed to Windsor ; and two days afterwards I received a parcel from her , my own letters all returned !-- and a few lines at the same time by the post , stating her extreme surprize at not having had the smallest reply to her last ; and adding , that as silence on such a point could not be misconstrued , and as it must be equally desirable to both to have every subordinate arrangement concluded as soon as possible , she now sent me , by a safe conveyance , all my letters , and requested , that if I could not directly command hers , so as to send them to Highbury within a week , I would forward them after that period to her at --: in short , the full direction to Mr . Smallridge ' s , near Bristol , stared me in the face . I knew the name , the place , I knew all about it , and instantly saw what she had been doing . It was perfectly accordant with that resolution of character which I knew her to possess ; and the secrecy she had maintained , as to any such design in her former letter , was equally descriptive of its anxious delicacy . For the world would not she have seemed to threaten me .-- Imagine the shock ; imagine how , till I had actually detected my own blunder , I raved at the blunders of the post .-- What was to be done ?-- One thing only .-- I must speak to my uncle . Without his sanction I could not hope to be listened to again .-- I spoke ; circumstances were in my favour ; the late event had softened away his pride , and he was , earlier than I could have anticipated , wholly reconciled and complying ; and could say at last , poor man ! with a deep sigh , that he wished I might find as much happiness in the marriage state as he had done .-- I felt that it would be of a different sort .-- Are you disposed to pity me for what I must have suffered in opening the cause to him , for my suspense while all was at stake ?-- No ; do not pity me till I reached Highbury , and saw how ill I had made her .
austen#Do not pity me till I saw her wan , sick looks .-- I reached Highbury at the time of day when , from my knowledge of their late breakfast hour , I was certain of a good chance of finding her alone .-- I was not disappointed ; and at last I was not disappointed either in the object of my journey . A great deal of very reasonable , very just displeasure I had to persuade away . But it is done ; we are reconciled , dearer , much dearer , than ever , and no moment ' s uneasiness can ever occur between us again . Now , my dear madam , I will release you ; but I could not conclude before . A thousand and a thousand thanks for all the kindness you have ever shewn me , and ten thousand for the attentions your heart will dictate towards her .-- If you think me in a way to be happier than I deserve , I am quite of your opinion .-- Miss W . calls me the child of good fortune . I hope she is right .-- In one respect , my good fortune is undoubted , that of being able to subscribe myself , Your obliged and affectionate Son , F . C . WESTON CHURCHILL .
austen#CHAPTER XV This letter must make its way to Emma ' s feelings . She was obliged , in spite of her previous determination to the contrary , to do it all the justice that Mrs . Weston foretold . As soon as she came to her own name , it was irresistible ; every line relating to herself was interesting , and almost every line agreeable ; and when this charm ceased , the subject could still maintain itself , by the natural return of her former regard for the writer , and the very strong attraction which any picture of love must have for her at that moment . She never stopt till she had gone through the whole ; and though it was impossible not to feel that he had been wrong , yet he had been less wrong than she had supposed -- and he had suffered , and was very sorry -- and he was so grateful to Mrs . Weston , and so much in love with Miss Fairfax , and she was so happy herself , that there was no being severe ; and could he have entered the room , she must have shaken hands with him as heartily as ever . She thought so well of the letter , that when Mr . Knightley came again , she desired him to read it .
austen#"She was sure of Mrs . Weston ' s wishing it to be communicated ; especially to one , who , like Mr . Knightley , had seen so much to blame in his conduct . "" I shall be very glad to look it over ,"" said he ; "" but it seems long . I will take it home with me at night ."" But that would not do . Mr . Weston was to call in the evening , and she must return it by him . "" I would rather be talking to you ,"" he replied ; "" but as it seems a matter of justice , it shall be done ."""
austen#"He began -- stopping , however , almost directly to say , "" Had I been offered the sight of one of this gentleman ' s letters to his mother - in - law a few months ago , Emma , it would not have been taken with such indifference ."" He proceeded a little farther , reading to himself ; and then , with a smile , observed , "" Humph ! a fine complimentary opening : But it is his way . One man ' s style must not be the rule of another ' s . We will not be severe ."" "" It will be natural for me ,"" he added shortly afterwards , "" to speak my opinion aloud as I read ."
austen#"By doing it , I shall feel that I am near you . It will not be so great a loss of time : but if you dislike it --"" "" Not at all . I should wish it ."" Mr . Knightley returned to his reading with greater alacrity . "" He trifles here ,"" said he , "" as to the temptation ."
austen#"He knows he is wrong , and has nothing rational to urge .-- Bad .-- He ought not to have formed the engagement .--` His father ' s disposition :'-- he is unjust , however , to his father . Mr . Weston ' s sanguine temper was a blessing on all his upright and honourable exertions ; but Mr . Weston earned every present comfort before he endeavoured to gain it .-- Very true ; he did not come till Miss Fairfax was here ."" "" And I have not forgotten ,"" said Emma , "" how sure you were that he might have come sooner if he would . You pass it over very handsomely -- but you were perfectly right ."" "" I was not quite impartial in my judgment , Emma :-- but yet , I think -- had _you_ not been in the case -- I should still have distrusted him ."" When he came to Miss Woodhouse , he was obliged to read the whole of it aloud -- all that related to her , with a smile ; a look ; a shake of the head ; a word or two of assent , or disapprobation ; or merely of love , as the subject required ; concluding , however , seriously , and , after steady reflection , thus --"
austen#""" Very bad -- though it might have been worse .-- Playing a most dangerous game . Too much indebted to the event for his acquittal .-- No judge of his own manners by you .-- Always deceived in fact by his own wishes , and regardless of little besides his own convenience .-- Fancying you to have fathomed his secret . Natural enough !-- his own mind full of intrigue , that he should suspect it in others .-- Mystery ; Finesse -- how they pervert the understanding ! My Emma , does not every thing serve to prove more and more the beauty of truth and sincerity in all our dealings with each other ?"" Emma agreed to it , and with a blush of sensibility on Harriet ' s account , which she could not give any sincere explanation of . "" You had better go on ,"" said she ."
austen#"He did so , but very soon stopt again to say , "" the pianoforte ! Ah ! That was the act of a very , very young man , one too young to consider whether the inconvenience of it might not very much exceed the pleasure . A boyish scheme , indeed !-- I cannot comprehend a man ' s wishing to give a woman any proof of affection which he knows she would rather dispense with ; and he did know that she would have prevented the instrument ' s coming if she could ."" After this , he made some progress without any pause . Frank Churchill ' s confession of having behaved shamefully was the first thing to call for more than a word in passing ."
austen#""" I perfectly agree with you , sir ,""-- was then his remark . "" You did behave very shamefully . You never wrote a truer line ."" And having gone through what immediately followed of the basis of their disagreement , and his persisting to act in direct opposition to Jane Fairfax ' s sense of right , he made a fuller pause to say , "" This is very bad .-- He had induced her to place herself , for his sake , in a situation of extreme difficulty and uneasiness , and it should have been his first object to prevent her from suffering unnecessarily .-- She must have had much more to contend with , in carrying on the correspondence , than he could . He should have respected even unreasonable scruples , had there been such ; but hers were all reasonable . We must look to her one fault , and remember that she had done a wrong thing in consenting to the engagement , to bear that she should have been in such a state of punishment ."""
austen#"Emma knew that he was now getting to the Box Hill party , and grew uncomfortable . Her own behaviour had been so very improper ! She was deeply ashamed , and a little afraid of his next look . It was all read , however , steadily , attentively , and without the smallest remark ; and , excepting one momentary glance at her , instantly withdrawn , in the fear of giving pain -- no remembrance of Box Hill seemed to exist . "" There is no saying much for the delicacy of our good friends , the Eltons ,"" was his next observation .--"" His feelings are natural .-- What ! actually resolve to break with him entirely !-- She felt the engagement to be a source of repentance and misery to each -- she dissolved it .-- What a view this gives of her sense of his behaviour !-- Well , he must be a most extraordinary --"""
austen#""" Nay , nay , read on .-- You will find how very much he suffers ."" "" I hope he does ,"" replied Mr . Knightley coolly , and resuming the letter . ""` Smallridge !' -- What does this mean ? What is all this ?"" "" She had engaged to go as governess to Mrs . Smallridge ' s children -- a dear friend of Mrs . Elton ' s -- a neighbour of Maple Grove ; and , by the bye , I wonder how Mrs . Elton bears the disappointment ?"""
austen#""" Say nothing , my dear Emma , while you oblige me to read -- not even of Mrs . Elton . Only one page more . I shall soon have done . What a letter the man writes !"" "" I wish you would read it with a kinder spirit towards him ."" "" Well , there _is_ feeling here .-- He does seem to have suffered in finding her ill .-- Certainly , I can have no doubt of his being fond of her ."
austen#` Dearer , much dearer than ever .' I hope he may long continue to feel all the value of such a reconciliation .-- He is a very liberal thanker , with his thousands and tens of thousands .--` Happier than I deserve .' Come , he knows himself there . ` Miss Woodhouse calls me the child of good fortune .' -- Those were Miss Woodhouse ' s words , were they ?-- And a fine ending -- and there is the letter . The child of good fortune !
austen#"That was your name for him , was it ?"" "" You do not appear so well satisfied with his letter as I am ; but still you must , at least I hope you must , think the better of him for it . I hope it does him some service with you ."" "" Yes , certainly it does . He has had great faults , faults of inconsideration and thoughtlessness ; and I am very much of his opinion in thinking him likely to be happier than he deserves : but still as he is , beyond a doubt , really attached to Miss Fairfax , and will soon , it may be hoped , have the advantage of being constantly with her , I am very ready to believe his character will improve , and acquire from hers the steadiness and delicacy of principle that it wants . And now , let me talk to you of something else ."
austen#"I have another person ' s interest at present so much at heart , that I cannot think any longer about Frank Churchill . Ever since I left you this morning , Emma , my mind has been hard at work on one subject ."" The subject followed ; it was in plain , unaffected , gentlemanlike English , such as Mr . Knightley used even to the woman he was in love with , how to be able to ask her to marry him , without attacking the happiness of her father . Emma ' s answer was ready at the first word . "" While her dear father lived , any change of condition must be impossible for her . She could never quit him ."""
austen#Part only of this answer , however , was admitted . The impossibility of her quitting her father , Mr . Knightley felt as strongly as herself ; but the inadmissibility of any other change , he could not agree to . He had been thinking it over most deeply , most intently ; he had at first hoped to induce Mr . Woodhouse to remove with her to Donwell ; he had wanted to believe it feasible , but his knowledge of Mr . Woodhouse would not suffer him to deceive himself long ; and now he confessed his persuasion , that such a transplantation would be a risk of her father ' s comfort , perhaps even of his life , which must not be hazarded . Mr . Woodhouse taken from Hartfield !-- No , he felt that it ought not to be attempted . But the plan which had arisen on the sacrifice of this , he trusted his dearest Emma would not find in any respect objectionable ; it was , that he should be received at Hartfield ; that so long as her father ' s happiness in other words his life -- required Hartfield to continue her home , it should be his likewise . Of their all removing to Donwell , Emma had already had her own passing thoughts .
austen#"Like him , she had tried the scheme and rejected it ; but such an alternative as this had not occurred to her . She was sensible of all the affection it evinced . She felt that , in quitting Donwell , he must be sacrificing a great deal of independence of hours and habits ; that in living constantly with her father , and in no house of his own , there would be much , very much , to be borne with . She promised to think of it , and advised him to think of it more ; but he was fully convinced , that no reflection could alter his wishes or his opinion on the subject . He had given it , he could assure her , very long and calm consideration ; he had been walking away from William Larkins the whole morning , to have his thoughts to himself . "" Ah !"
austen#"there is one difficulty unprovided for ,"" cried Emma . "" I am sure William Larkins will not like it . You must get his consent before you ask mine ."" She promised , however , to think of it ; and pretty nearly promised , moreover , to think of it , with the intention of finding it a very good scheme . It is remarkable , that Emma , in the many , very many , points of view in which she was now beginning to consider Donwell Abbey , was never struck with any sense of injury to her nephew Henry , whose rights as heir - expectant had formerly been so tenaciously regarded . Think she must of the possible difference to the poor little boy ; and yet she only gave herself a saucy conscious smile about it , and found amusement in detecting the real cause of that violent dislike of Mr . Knightley ' s marrying Jane Fairfax , or any body else , which at the time she had wholly imputed to the amiable solicitude of the sister and the aunt ."
austen#This proposal of his , this plan of marrying and continuing at Hartfield -- the more she contemplated it , the more pleasing it became . His evils seemed to lessen , her own advantages to increase , their mutual good to outweigh every drawback . Such a companion for herself in the periods of anxiety and cheerlessness before her !-- Such a partner in all those duties and cares to which time must be giving increase of melancholy ! She would have been too happy but for poor Harriet ; but every blessing of her own seemed to involve and advance the sufferings of her friend , who must now be even excluded from Hartfield . The delightful family party which Emma was securing for herself , poor Harriet must , in mere charitable caution , be kept at a distance from . She would be a loser in every way .
austen#Emma could not deplore her future absence as any deduction from her own enjoyment . In such a party , Harriet would be rather a dead weight than otherwise ; but for the poor girl herself , it seemed a peculiarly cruel necessity that was to be placing her in such a state of unmerited punishment . In time , of course , Mr . Knightley would be forgotten , that is , supplanted ; but this could not be expected to happen very early . Mr . Knightley himself would be doing nothing to assist the cure ;-- not like Mr . Elton . Mr . Knightley , always so kind , so feeling , so truly considerate for every body , would never deserve to be less worshipped than now ; and it really was too much to hope even of Harriet , that she could be in love with more than _three_ men in one year . CHAPTER XVI
austen#It was a very great relief to Emma to find Harriet as desirous as herself to avoid a meeting . Their intercourse was painful enough by letter . How much worse , had they been obliged to meet ! Harriet expressed herself very much as might be supposed , without reproaches , or apparent sense of ill - usage ; and yet Emma fancied there was a something of resentment , a something bordering on it in her style , which increased the desirableness of their being separate .-- It might be only her own consciousness ; but it seemed as if an angel only could have been quite without resentment under such a stroke . She had no difficulty in procuring Isabella ' s invitation ; and she was fortunate in having a sufficient reason for asking it , without resorting to invention .-- There was a tooth amiss . Harriet really wished , and had wished some time , to consult a dentist .
austen#Mrs . John Knightley was delighted to be of use ; any thing of ill health was a recommendation to her -- and though not so fond of a dentist as of a Mr . Wingfield , she was quite eager to have Harriet under her care .-- When it was thus settled on her sister ' s side , Emma proposed it to her friend , and found her very persuadable .-- Harriet was to go ; she was invited for at least a fortnight ; she was to be conveyed in Mr . Woodhouse ' s carriage .-- It was all arranged , it was all completed , and Harriet was safe in Brunswick Square . Now Emma could , indeed , enjoy Mr . Knightley ' s visits ; now she could talk , and she could listen with true happiness , unchecked by that sense of injustice , of guilt , of something most painful , which had haunted her when remembering how disappointed a heart was near her , how much might at that moment , and at a little distance , be enduring by the feelings which she had led astray herself . The difference of Harriet at Mrs . Goddard ' s , or in London , made perhaps an unreasonable difference in Emma ' s sensations ; but she could not think of her in London without objects of curiosity and employment , which must be averting the past , and carrying her out of herself . She would not allow any other anxiety to succeed directly to the place in her mind which Harriet had occupied . There was a communication before her , one which _she_ only could be competent to make -- the confession of her engagement to her father ; but she would have nothing to do with it at present .-- She had resolved to defer the disclosure till Mrs . Weston were safe and well . No additional agitation should be thrown at this period among those she loved -- and the evil should not act on herself by anticipation before the appointed time .-- A fortnight , at least , of leisure and peace of mind , to crown every warmer , but more agitating , delight , should be hers .
austen#"She soon resolved , equally as a duty and a pleasure , to employ half an hour of this holiday of spirits in calling on Miss Fairfax .-- She ought to go -- and she was longing to see her ; the resemblance of their present situations increasing every other motive of goodwill . It would be a _secret_ satisfaction ; but the consciousness of a similarity of prospect would certainly add to the interest with which she should attend to any thing Jane might communicate . She went -- she had driven once unsuccessfully to the door , but had not been into the house since the morning after Box Hill , when poor Jane had been in such distress as had filled her with compassion , though all the worst of her sufferings had been unsuspected .-- The fear of being still unwelcome , determined her , though assured of their being at home , to wait in the passage , and send up her name .-- She heard Patty announcing it ; but no such bustle succeeded as poor Miss Bates had before made so happily intelligible .-- No ; she heard nothing but the instant reply of , "" Beg her to walk up ;""-- and a moment afterwards she was met on the stairs by Jane herself , coming eagerly forward , as if no other reception of her were felt sufficient .-- Emma had never seen her look so well , so lovely , so engaging . There was consciousness , animation , and warmth ; there was every thing which her countenance or manner could ever have wanted .-- She came forward with an offered hand ; and said , in a low , but very feeling tone , "" This is most kind , indeed !-- Miss Woodhouse , it is impossible for me to express -- I hope you will believe -- Excuse me for being so entirely without words ."" Emma was gratified , and would soon have shewn no want of words , if the sound of Mrs . Elton ' s voice from the sitting - room had not checked her , and made it expedient to compress all her friendly and all her congratulatory sensations into a very , very earnest shake of the hand ."
austen#"Mrs . Bates and Mrs . Elton were together . Miss Bates was out , which accounted for the previous tranquillity . Emma could have wished Mrs . Elton elsewhere ; but she was in a humour to have patience with every body ; and as Mrs . Elton met her with unusual graciousness , she hoped the rencontre would do them no harm . She soon believed herself to penetrate Mrs . Elton ' s thoughts , and understand why she was , like herself , in happy spirits ; it was being in Miss Fairfax ' s confidence , and fancying herself acquainted with what was still a secret to other people . Emma saw symptoms of it immediately in the expression of her face ; and while paying her own compliments to Mrs . Bates , and appearing to attend to the good old lady ' s replies , she saw her with a sort of anxious parade of mystery fold up a letter which she had apparently been reading aloud to Miss Fairfax , and return it into the purple and gold reticule by her side , saying , with significant nods , "" We can finish this some other time , you know ."
austen#You and I shall not want opportunities . And , in fact , you have heard all the essential already . I only wanted to prove to you that Mrs . S . admits our apology , and is not offended . You see how delightfully she writes . Oh ! she is a sweet creature !
austen#"You would have doated on her , had you gone .-- But not a word more . Let us be discreet -- quite on our good behaviour .-- Hush !-- You remember those lines -- I forget the poem at this moment : "" For when a lady ' s in the case , "" You know all other things give place ."" Now I say , my dear , in _our_ case , for _lady_ , read ---- mum ! a word to the wise .-- I am in a fine flow of spirits , an ' t I ? But I want to set your heart at ease as to Mrs . S .-- _My_ representation , you see , has quite appeased her ."""
austen#"And again , on Emma ' s merely turning her head to look at Mrs . Bates ' s knitting , she added , in a half whisper , "" I mentioned no _names_ , you will observe .-- Oh ! no ; cautious as a minister of state . I managed it extremely well ."" Emma could not doubt . It was a palpable display , repeated on every possible occasion ."
austen#"When they had all talked a little while in harmony of the weather and Mrs . Weston , she found herself abruptly addressed with , "" Do not you think , Miss Woodhouse , our saucy little friend here is charmingly recovered ?-- Do not you think her cure does Perry the highest credit ?--( here was a side - glance of great meaning at Jane .) Upon my word , Perry has restored her in a wonderful short time !-- Oh ! if you had seen her , as I did , when she was at the worst !"" -- And when Mrs . Bates was saying something to Emma , whispered farther , "" We do not say a word of any _assistance_ that Perry might have ; not a word of a certain young physician from Windsor .-- Oh ! no ; Perry shall have all the credit ."""
austen#""" I have scarce had the pleasure of seeing you , Miss Woodhouse ,"" she shortly afterwards began , "" since the party to Box Hill . Very pleasant party . But yet I think there was something wanting . Things did not seem -- that is , there seemed a little cloud upon the spirits of some .-- So it appeared to me at least , but I might be mistaken . However , I think it answered so far as to tempt one to go again . What say you both to our collecting the same party , and exploring to Box Hill again , while the fine weather lasts ?-- It must be the same party , you know , quite the same party , not _one_ exception ."""
austen#"Soon after this Miss Bates came in , and Emma could not help being diverted by the perplexity of her first answer to herself , resulting , she supposed , from doubt of what might be said , and impatience to say every thing . "" Thank you , dear Miss Woodhouse , you are all kindness .-- It is impossible to say -- Yes , indeed , I quite understand -- dearest Jane ' s prospects -- that is , I do not mean .-- But she is charmingly recovered .-- How is Mr . Woodhouse ?-- I am so glad .-- Quite out of my power .-- Such a happy little circle as you find us here .-- Yes , indeed .-- Charming young man !-- that is -- so very friendly ; I mean good Mr . Perry !-- such attention to Jane !"" -- And from her great , her more than commonly thankful delight towards Mrs . Elton for being there , Emma guessed that there had been a little show of resentment towards Jane , from the vicarage quarter , which was now graciously overcome .-- After a few whispers , indeed , which placed it beyond a guess , Mrs . Elton , speaking louder , said , "" Yes , here I am , my good friend ; and here I have been so long , that anywhere else I should think it necessary to apologise ; but , the truth is , that I am waiting for my lord and master ."
austen#"He promised to join me here , and pay his respects to you ."" "" What ! are we to have the pleasure of a call from Mr . Elton ?-- That will be a favour indeed ! for I know gentlemen do not like morning visits , and Mr . Elton ' s time is so engaged ."" "" Upon my word it is , Miss Bates .-- He really is engaged from morning to night .-- There is no end of people ' s coming to him , on some pretence or other .-- The magistrates , and overseers , and churchwardens , are always wanting his opinion ."
austen#"They seem not able to do any thing without him .--` Upon my word , Mr . E .,' I often say , ` rather you than I .-- I do not know what would become of my crayons and my instrument , if I had half so many applicants .' -- Bad enough as it is , for I absolutely neglect them both to an unpardonable degree .-- I believe I have not played a bar this fortnight .-- However , he is coming , I assure you : yes , indeed , on purpose to wait on you all ."" And putting up her hand to screen her words from Emma --"" A congratulatory visit , you know .-- Oh ! yes , quite indispensable ."" Miss Bates looked about her , so happily !-- "" He promised to come to me as soon as he could disengage himself from Knightley ; but he and Knightley are shut up together in deep consultation .-- Mr ."
austen#"E . is Knightley ' s right hand ."" Emma would not have smiled for the world , and only said , "" Is Mr . Elton gone on foot to Donwell ?-- He will have a hot walk ."" "" Oh ! no , it is a meeting at the Crown , a regular meeting . Weston and Cole will be there too ; but one is apt to speak only of those who lead .-- I fancy Mr . E . and Knightley have every thing their own way ."" "" Have not you mistaken the day ?"""
austen#"said Emma . "" I am almost certain that the meeting at the Crown is not till to - morrow .-- Mr . Knightley was at Hartfield yesterday , and spoke of it as for Saturday ."" "" Oh ! no , the meeting is certainly to - day ,"" was the abrupt answer , which denoted the impossibility of any blunder on Mrs . Elton ' s side .-- "" I do believe ,"" she continued , "" this is the most troublesome parish that ever was . We never heard of such things at Maple Grove ."""
austen#""" Your parish there was small ,"" said Jane . "" Upon my word , my dear , I do not know , for I never heard the subject talked of ."" "" But it is proved by the smallness of the school , which I have heard you speak of , as under the patronage of your sister and Mrs . Bragge ; the only school , and not more than five - and - twenty children ."" "" Ah ! you clever creature , that ' s very true . What a thinking brain you have !"
austen#"I say , Jane , what a perfect character you and I should make , if we could be shaken together . My liveliness and your solidity would produce perfection .-- Not that I presume to insinuate , however , that _some_ people may not think _you_ perfection already .-- But hush !-- not a word , if you please ."" It seemed an unnecessary caution ; Jane was wanting to give her words , not to Mrs . Elton , but to Miss Woodhouse , as the latter plainly saw . The wish of distinguishing her , as far as civility permitted , was very evident , though it could not often proceed beyond a look . Mr . Elton made his appearance . His lady greeted him with some of her sparkling vivacity ."
austen#""" Very pretty , sir , upon my word ; to send me on here , to be an encumbrance to my friends , so long before you vouchsafe to come !-- But you knew what a dutiful creature you had to deal with . You knew I should not stir till my lord and master appeared .-- Here have I been sitting this hour , giving these young ladies a sample of true conjugal obedience -- for who can say , you know , how soon it may be wanted ?"" Mr . Elton was so hot and tired , that all this wit seemed thrown away . His civilities to the other ladies must be paid ; but his subsequent object was to lament over himself for the heat he was suffering , and the walk he had had for nothing . "" When I got to Donwell ,"" said he , "" Knightley could not be found . Very odd !"
austen#"very unaccountable ! after the note I sent him this morning , and the message he returned , that he should certainly be at home till one ."" "" Donwell !"" cried his wife .--"" My dear Mr . E ., you have not been to Donwell !-- You mean the Crown ; you come from the meeting at the Crown ."" "" No , no , that ' s to - morrow ; and I particularly wanted to see Knightley to - day on that very account .-- Such a dreadful broiling morning !-- I went over the fields too --( speaking in a tone of great ill - usage ,) which made it so much the worse . And then not to find him at home !"
austen#"I assure you I am not at all pleased . And no apology left , no message for me . The housekeeper declared she knew nothing of my being expected .-- Very extraordinary !-- And nobody knew at all which way he was gone . Perhaps to Hartfield , perhaps to the Abbey Mill , perhaps into his woods .-- Miss Woodhouse , this is not like our friend Knightley !-- Can you explain it ?"" Emma amused herself by protesting that it was very extraordinary , indeed , and that she had not a syllable to say for him . "" I cannot imagine ,"" said Mrs . Elton , ( feeling the indignity as a wife ought to do ,) "" I cannot imagine how he could do such a thing by you , of all people in the world !"
austen#"The very last person whom one should expect to be forgotten !-- My dear Mr . E ., he must have left a message for you , I am sure he must .-- Not even Knightley could be so very eccentric ;-- and his servants forgot it . Depend upon it , that was the case : and very likely to happen with the Donwell servants , who are all , I have often observed , extremely awkward and remiss .-- I am sure I would not have such a creature as his Harry stand at our sideboard for any consideration . And as for Mrs . Hodges , Wright holds her very cheap indeed .-- She promised Wright a receipt , and never sent it ."" "" I met William Larkins ,"" continued Mr . Elton , "" as I got near the house , and he told me I should not find his master at home , but I did not believe him .-- William seemed rather out of humour . He did not know what was come to his master lately , he said , but he could hardly ever get the speech of him . I have nothing to do with William ' s wants , but it really is of very great importance that _I_ should see Knightley to - day ; and it becomes a matter , therefore , of very serious inconvenience that I should have had this hot walk to no purpose ."""
austen#"Emma felt that she could not do better than go home directly . In all probability she was at this very time waited for there ; and Mr . Knightley might be preserved from sinking deeper in aggression towards Mr . Elton , if not towards William Larkins . She was pleased , on taking leave , to find Miss Fairfax determined to attend her out of the room , to go with her even downstairs ; it gave her an opportunity which she immediately made use of , to say , "" It is as well , perhaps , that I have not had the possibility . Had you not been surrounded by other friends , I might have been tempted to introduce a subject , to ask questions , to speak more openly than might have been strictly correct .-- I feel that I should certainly have been impertinent ."" "" Oh !"""
austen#"cried Jane , with a blush and an hesitation which Emma thought infinitely more becoming to her than all the elegance of all her usual composure --"" there would have been no danger . The danger would have been of my wearying you . You could not have gratified me more than by expressing an interest --. Indeed , Miss Woodhouse , ( speaking more collectedly ,) with the consciousness which I have of misconduct , very great misconduct , it is particularly consoling to me to know that those of my friends , whose good opinion is most worth preserving , are not disgusted to such a degree as to -- I have not time for half that I could wish to say . I long to make apologies , excuses , to urge something for myself . I feel it so very due ."
austen#"But , unfortunately -- in short , if your compassion does not stand my friend --"" "" Oh ! you are too scrupulous , indeed you are ,"" cried Emma warmly , and taking her hand . "" You owe me no apologies ; and every body to whom you might be supposed to owe them , is so perfectly satisfied , so delighted even --"" "" You are very kind , but I know what my manners were to you .-- So cold and artificial !-- I had always a part to act .-- It was a life of deceit !-- I know that I must have disgusted you ."" "" Pray say no more ."
austen#"I feel that all the apologies should be on my side . Let us forgive each other at once . We must do whatever is to be done quickest , and I think our feelings will lose no time there . I hope you have pleasant accounts from Windsor ?"" "" Very ."" "" And the next news , I suppose , will be , that we are to lose you -- just as I begin to know you ."""
austen#""" Oh ! as to all that , of course nothing can be thought of yet . I am here till claimed by Colonel and Mrs . Campbell ."" "" Nothing can be actually settled yet , perhaps ,"" replied Emma , smiling --"" but , excuse me , it must be thought of ."" The smile was returned as Jane answered ,"
austen#""" You are very right ; it has been thought of . And I will own to you , ( I am sure it will be safe ), that so far as our living with Mr . Churchill at Enscombe , it is settled . There must be three months , at least , of deep mourning ; but when they are over , I imagine there will be nothing more to wait for ."" "" Thank you , thank you .-- This is just what I wanted to be assured of .-- Oh ! if you knew how much I love every thing that is decided and open !-- Good - bye , good - bye ."" CHAPTER XVII"
austen#"Mrs . Weston ' s friends were all made happy by her safety ; and if the satisfaction of her well - doing could be increased to Emma , it was by knowing her to be the mother of a little girl . She had been decided in wishing for a Miss Weston . She would not acknowledge that it was with any view of making a match for her , hereafter , with either of Isabella ' s sons ; but she was convinced that a daughter would suit both father and mother best . It would be a great comfort to Mr . Weston , as he grew older -- and even Mr . Weston might be growing older ten years hence -- to have his fireside enlivened by the sports and the nonsense , the freaks and the fancies of a child never banished from home ; and Mrs . Weston -- no one could doubt that a daughter would be most to her ; and it would be quite a pity that any one who so well knew how to teach , should not have their powers in exercise again . "" She has had the advantage , you know , of practising on me ,"" she continued --"" like La Baronne d ' Almane on La Comtesse d ' Ostalis , in Madame de Genlis ' Adelaide and Theodore , and we shall now see her own little Adelaide educated on a more perfect plan ."" "" That is ,"" replied Mr . Knightley , "" she will indulge her even more than she did you , and believe that she does not indulge her at all ."
austen#"It will be the only difference ."" "" Poor child !"" cried Emma ; "" at that rate , what will become of her ?"" "" Nothing very bad .-- The fate of thousands . She will be disagreeable in infancy , and correct herself as she grows older . I am losing all my bitterness against spoilt children , my dearest Emma ."
austen#"I , who am owing all my happiness to _you_ , would not it be horrible ingratitude in me to be severe on them ?"" Emma laughed , and replied : "" But I had the assistance of all your endeavours to counteract the indulgence of other people . I doubt whether my own sense would have corrected me without it ."" "" Do you ?-- I have no doubt . Nature gave you understanding :-- Miss Taylor gave you principles . You must have done well ."
austen#"My interference was quite as likely to do harm as good . It was very natural for you to say , what right has he to lecture me ?-- and I am afraid very natural for you to feel that it was done in a disagreeable manner . I do not believe I did you any good . The good was all to myself , by making you an object of the tenderest affection to me . I could not think about you so much without doating on you , faults and all ; and by dint of fancying so many errors , have been in love with you ever since you were thirteen at least ."" "" I am sure you were of use to me ,"" cried Emma ."
austen#""" I was very often influenced rightly by you -- oftener than I would own at the time . I am very sure you did me good . And if poor little Anna Weston is to be spoiled , it will be the greatest humanity in you to do as much for her as you have done for me , except falling in love with her when she is thirteen ."" "" How often , when you were a girl , have you said to me , with one of your saucy looks --` Mr . Knightley , I am going to do so - and - so ; papa says I may , or I have Miss Taylor ' s leave '-- something which , you knew , I did not approve . In such cases my interference was giving you two bad feelings instead of one ."" "" What an amiable creature I was !-- No wonder you should hold my speeches in such affectionate remembrance ."""
austen#"""` Mr . Knightley .' -- You always called me , ` Mr . Knightley ;' and , from habit , it has not so very formal a sound .-- And yet it is formal . I want you to call me something else , but I do not know what ."" "" I remember once calling you ` George ,' in one of my amiable fits , about ten years ago . I did it because I thought it would offend you ; but , as you made no objection , I never did it again ."""
austen#""" And cannot you call me ` George ' now ?"" "" Impossible !-- I never can call you any thing but ` Mr . Knightley .' I will not promise even to equal the elegant terseness of Mrs . Elton , by calling you Mr . K .-- But I will promise ,"" she added presently , laughing and blushing --"" I will promise to call you once by your Christian name . I do not say when , but perhaps you may guess where ;-- in the building in which N . takes M . for better , for worse ."" Emma grieved that she could not be more openly just to one important service which his better sense would have rendered her , to the advice which would have saved her from the worst of all her womanly follies -- her wilful intimacy with Harriet Smith ; but it was too tender a subject .-- She could not enter on it .-- Harriet was very seldom mentioned between them ."
austen#This , on his side , might merely proceed from her not being thought of ; but Emma was rather inclined to attribute it to delicacy , and a suspicion , from some appearances , that their friendship were declining . She was aware herself , that , parting under any other circumstances , they certainly should have corresponded more , and that her intelligence would not have rested , as it now almost wholly did , on Isabella ' s letters . He might observe that it was so . The pain of being obliged to practise concealment towards him , was very little inferior to the pain of having made Harriet unhappy . Isabella sent quite as good an account of her visitor as could be expected ; on her first arrival she had thought her out of spirits , which appeared perfectly natural , as there was a dentist to be consulted ; but , since that business had been over , she did not appear to find Harriet different from what she had known her before .-- Isabella , to be sure , was no very quick observer ; yet if Harriet had not been equal to playing with the children , it would not have escaped her . Emma ' s comforts and hopes were most agreeably carried on , by Harriet ' s being to stay longer ; her fortnight was likely to be a month at least .
austen#"Mr . and Mrs . John Knightley were to come down in August , and she was invited to remain till they could bring her back . "" John does not even mention your friend ,"" said Mr . Knightley . "" Here is his answer , if you like to see it ."" It was the answer to the communication of his intended marriage . Emma accepted it with a very eager hand , with an impatience all alive to know what he would say about it , and not at all checked by hearing that her friend was unmentioned . "" John enters like a brother into my happiness ,"" continued Mr . Knightley , "" but he is no complimenter ; and though I well know him to have , likewise , a most brotherly affection for you , he is so far from making flourishes , that any other young woman might think him rather cool in her praise ."
austen#"But I am not afraid of your seeing what he writes ."" "" He writes like a sensible man ,"" replied Emma , when she had read the letter . "" I honour his sincerity . It is very plain that he considers the good fortune of the engagement as all on my side , but that he is not without hope of my growing , in time , as worthy of your affection , as you think me already . Had he said any thing to bear a different construction , I should not have believed him ."" "" My Emma , he means no such thing ."
austen#"He only means --"" "" He and I should differ very little in our estimation of the two ,"" interrupted she , with a sort of serious smile --"" much less , perhaps , than he is aware of , if we could enter without ceremony or reserve on the subject ."" "" Emma , my dear Emma --"" "" Oh !"" she cried with more thorough gaiety , "" if you fancy your brother does not do me justice , only wait till my dear father is in the secret , and hear his opinion . Depend upon it , he will be much farther from doing _you_ justice ."
austen#"He will think all the happiness , all the advantage , on your side of the question ; all the merit on mine . I wish I may not sink into ` poor Emma ' with him at once .-- His tender compassion towards oppressed worth can go no farther ."" "" Ah !"" he cried , "" I wish your father might be half as easily convinced as John will be , of our having every right that equal worth can give , to be happy together . I am amused by one part of John ' s letter -- did you notice it ?-- where he says , that my information did not take him wholly by surprize , that he was rather in expectation of hearing something of the kind ."" "" If I understand your brother , he only means so far as your having some thoughts of marrying ."
austen#"He had no idea of me . He seems perfectly unprepared for that ."" "" Yes , yes -- but I am amused that he should have seen so far into my feelings . What has he been judging by ?-- I am not conscious of any difference in my spirits or conversation that could prepare him at this time for my marrying any more than at another .-- But it was so , I suppose . I dare say there was a difference when I was staying with them the other day . I believe I did not play with the children quite so much as usual ."
austen#"I remember one evening the poor boys saying , ` Uncle seems always tired now .'"" The time was coming when the news must spread farther , and other persons ' reception of it tried . As soon as Mrs . Weston was sufficiently recovered to admit Mr . Woodhouse ' s visits , Emma having it in view that her gentle reasonings should be employed in the cause , resolved first to announce it at home , and then at Randalls .-- But how to break it to her father at last !-- She had bound herself to do it , in such an hour of Mr . Knightley ' s absence , or when it came to the point her heart would have failed her , and she must have put it off ; but Mr . Knightley was to come at such a time , and follow up the beginning she was to make .-- She was forced to speak , and to speak cheerfully too . She must not make it a more decided subject of misery to him , by a melancholy tone herself . She must not appear to think it a misfortune .-- With all the spirits she could command , she prepared him first for something strange , and then , in a few words , said , that if his consent and approbation could be obtained -- which , she trusted , would be attended with no difficulty , since it was a plan to promote the happiness of all -- she and Mr . Knightley meant to marry ; by which means Hartfield would receive the constant addition of that person ' s company whom she knew he loved , next to his daughters and Mrs . Weston , best in the world . Poor man !-- it was at first a considerable shock to him , and he tried earnestly to dissuade her from it ."
austen#She was reminded , more than once , of having always said she would never marry , and assured that it would be a great deal better for her to remain single ; and told of poor Isabella , and poor Miss Taylor .-- But it would not do . Emma hung about him affectionately , and smiled , and said it must be so ; and that he must not class her with Isabella and Mrs . Weston , whose marriages taking them from Hartfield , had , indeed , made a melancholy change : but she was not going from Hartfield ; she should be always there ; she was introducing no change in their numbers or their comforts but for the better ; and she was very sure that he would be a great deal the happier for having Mr . Knightley always at hand , when he were once got used to the idea .-- Did he not love Mr . Knightley very much ?-- He would not deny that he did , she was sure .-- Whom did he ever want to consult on business but Mr . Knightley ?-- Who was so useful to him , who so ready to write his letters , who so glad to assist him ?-- Who so cheerful , so attentive , so attached to him ?-- Would not he like to have him always on the spot ?-- Yes . That was all very true . Mr . Knightley could not be there too often ; he should be glad to see him every day ;-- but they did see him every day as it was .-- Why could not they go on as they had done ? Mr . Woodhouse could not be soon reconciled ; but the worst was overcome , the idea was given ; time and continual repetition must do the rest .-- To Emma ' s entreaties and assurances succeeded Mr . Knightley ' s , whose fond praise of her gave the subject even a kind of welcome ; and he was soon used to be talked to by each , on every fair occasion .-- They had all the assistance which Isabella could give , by letters of the strongest approbation ; and Mrs . Weston was ready , on the first meeting , to consider the subject in the most serviceable light -- first , as a settled , and , secondly , as a good one -- well aware of the nearly equal importance of the two recommendations to Mr . Woodhouse ' s mind .-- It was agreed upon , as what was to be ; and every body by whom he was used to be guided assuring him that it would be for his happiness ; and having some feelings himself which almost admitted it , he began to think that some time or other -- in another year or two , perhaps -- it might not be so very bad if the marriage did take place .
austen#"Mrs . Weston was acting no part , feigning no feelings in all that she said to him in favour of the event .-- She had been extremely surprized , never more so , than when Emma first opened the affair to her ; but she saw in it only increase of happiness to all , and had no scruple in urging him to the utmost .-- She had such a regard for Mr . Knightley , as to think he deserved even her dearest Emma ; and it was in every respect so proper , suitable , and unexceptionable a connexion , and in one respect , one point of the highest importance , so peculiarly eligible , so singularly fortunate , that now it seemed as if Emma could not safely have attached herself to any other creature , and that she had herself been the stupidest of beings in not having thought of it , and wished it long ago .-- How very few of those men in a rank of life to address Emma would have renounced their own home for Hartfield ! And who but Mr . Knightley could know and bear with Mr . Woodhouse , so as to make such an arrangement desirable !-- The difficulty of disposing of poor Mr . Woodhouse had been always felt in her husband ' s plans and her own , for a marriage between Frank and Emma . How to settle the claims of Enscombe and Hartfield had been a continual impediment -- less acknowledged by Mr . Weston than by herself -- but even he had never been able to finish the subject better than by saying --"" Those matters will take care of themselves ; the young people will find a way ."" But here there was nothing to be shifted off in a wild speculation on the future . It was all right , all open , all equal . No sacrifice on any side worth the name ."
austen#"It was a union of the highest promise of felicity in itself , and without one real , rational difficulty to oppose or delay it . Mrs . Weston , with her baby on her knee , indulging in such reflections as these , was one of the happiest women in the world . If any thing could increase her delight , it was perceiving that the baby would soon have outgrown its first set of caps . The news was universally a surprize wherever it spread ; and Mr . Weston had his five minutes share of it ; but five minutes were enough to familiarise the idea to his quickness of mind .-- He saw the advantages of the match , and rejoiced in them with all the constancy of his wife ; but the wonder of it was very soon nothing ; and by the end of an hour he was not far from believing that he had always foreseen it . "" It is to be a secret , I conclude ,"" said he . "" These matters are always a secret , till it is found out that every body knows them ."
austen#"Only let me be told when I may speak out .-- I wonder whether Jane has any suspicion ."" He went to Highbury the next morning , and satisfied himself on that point . He told her the news . Was not she like a daughter , his eldest daughter ?-- he must tell her ; and Miss Bates being present , it passed , of course , to Mrs . Cole , Mrs . Perry , and Mrs . Elton , immediately afterwards . It was no more than the principals were prepared for ; they had calculated from the time of its being known at Randalls , how soon it would be over Highbury ; and were thinking of themselves , as the evening wonder in many a family circle , with great sagacity . In general , it was a very well approved match ."
austen#"Some might think him , and others might think her , the most in luck . One set might recommend their all removing to Donwell , and leaving Hartfield for the John Knightleys ; and another might predict disagreements among their servants ; but yet , upon the whole , there was no serious objection raised , except in one habitation , the Vicarage .-- There , the surprize was not softened by any satisfaction . Mr . Elton cared little about it , compared with his wife ; he only hoped "" the young lady ' s pride would now be contented ;"" and supposed "" she had always meant to catch Knightley if she could ;"" and , on the point of living at Hartfield , could daringly exclaim , "" Rather he than I !"" -- But Mrs . Elton was very much discomposed indeed .--"" Poor Knightley ! poor fellow !-- sad business for him .-- She was extremely concerned ; for , though very eccentric , he had a thousand good qualities .-- How could he be so taken in ?-- Did not think him at all in love -- not in the least .-- Poor Knightley !-- There would be an end of all pleasant intercourse with him .-- How happy he had been to come and dine with them whenever they asked him ! But that would be all over now .-- Poor fellow !-- No more exploring parties to Donwell made for _her_ ."
austen#Oh ! no ; there would be a Mrs . Knightley to throw cold water on every thing .-- Extremely disagreeable ! But she was not at all sorry that she had abused the housekeeper the other day .-- Shocking plan , living together . It would never do . She knew a family near Maple Grove who had tried it , and been obliged to separate before the end of the first quarter . CHAPTER XVIII
austen#"Time passed on . A few more to - morrows , and the party from London would be arriving . It was an alarming change ; and Emma was thinking of it one morning , as what must bring a great deal to agitate and grieve her , when Mr . Knightley came in , and distressing thoughts were put by . After the first chat of pleasure he was silent ; and then , in a graver tone , began with , "" I have something to tell you , Emma ; some news ."" "" Good or bad ?"""
austen#"said she , quickly , looking up in his face . "" I do not know which it ought to be called ."" "" Oh ! good I am sure .-- I see it in your countenance . You are trying not to smile ."" "" I am afraid ,"" said he , composing his features , "" I am very much afraid , my dear Emma , that you will not smile when you hear it ."""
austen#""" Indeed ! but why so ?-- I can hardly imagine that any thing which pleases or amuses you , should not please and amuse me too ."" "" There is one subject ,"" he replied , "" I hope but one , on which we do not think alike ."" He paused a moment , again smiling , with his eyes fixed on her face . "" Does nothing occur to you ?-- Do not you recollect ?-- Harriet Smith ."" Her cheeks flushed at the name , and she felt afraid of something , though she knew not what ."
austen#""" Have you heard from her yourself this morning ?"" cried he . "" You have , I believe , and know the whole ."" "" No , I have not ; I know nothing ; pray tell me ."" "" You are prepared for the worst , I see -- and very bad it is . Harriet Smith marries Robert Martin ."""
austen#"Emma gave a start , which did not seem like being prepared -- and her eyes , in eager gaze , said , "" No , this is impossible !"" but her lips were closed . "" It is so , indeed ,"" continued Mr . Knightley ; "" I have it from Robert Martin himself . He left me not half an hour ago ."" She was still looking at him with the most speaking amazement . "" You like it , my Emma , as little as I feared .-- I wish our opinions were the same ."
austen#"But in time they will . Time , you may be sure , will make one or the other of us think differently ; and , in the meanwhile , we need not talk much on the subject ."" "" You mistake me , you quite mistake me ,"" she replied , exerting herself . "" It is not that such a circumstance would now make me unhappy , but I cannot believe it . It seems an impossibility !-- You cannot mean to say , that Harriet Smith has accepted Robert Martin . You cannot mean that he has even proposed to her again -- yet ."
austen#"You only mean , that he intends it ."" "" I mean that he has done it ,"" answered Mr . Knightley , with smiling but determined decision , "" and been accepted ."" "" Good God !"" she cried .--"" Well !"" -- Then having recourse to her workbasket , in excuse for leaning down her face , and concealing all the exquisite feelings of delight and entertainment which she knew she must be expressing , she added , "" Well , now tell me every thing ; make this intelligible to me . How , where , when ?-- Let me know it all ."
austen#"I never was more surprized -- but it does not make me unhappy , I assure you .-- How -- how has it been possible ?"" "" It is a very simple story . He went to town on business three days ago , and I got him to take charge of some papers which I was wanting to send to John .-- He delivered these papers to John , at his chambers , and was asked by him to join their party the same evening to Astley ' s . They were going to take the two eldest boys to Astley ' s . The party was to be our brother and sister , Henry , John -- and Miss Smith . My friend Robert could not resist ."
austen#"They called for him in their way ; were all extremely amused ; and my brother asked him to dine with them the next day -- which he did -- and in the course of that visit ( as I understand ) he found an opportunity of speaking to Harriet ; and certainly did not speak in vain .-- She made him , by her acceptance , as happy even as he is deserving . He came down by yesterday ' s coach , and was with me this morning immediately after breakfast , to report his proceedings , first on my affairs , and then on his own . This is all that I can relate of the how , where , and when . Your friend Harriet will make a much longer history when you see her .-- She will give you all the minute particulars , which only woman ' s language can make interesting .-- In our communications we deal only in the great .-- However , I must say , that Robert Martin ' s heart seemed for _him_ , and to _me_ , very overflowing ; and that he did mention , without its being much to the purpose , that on quitting their box at Astley ' s , my brother took charge of Mrs . John Knightley and little John , and he followed with Miss Smith and Henry ; and that at one time they were in such a crowd , as to make Miss Smith rather uneasy ."" He stopped .-- Emma dared not attempt any immediate reply . To speak , she was sure would be to betray a most unreasonable degree of happiness ."
austen#"She must wait a moment , or he would think her mad . Her silence disturbed him ; and after observing her a little while , he added , "" Emma , my love , you said that this circumstance would not now make you unhappy ; but I am afraid it gives you more pain than you expected . His situation is an evil -- but you must consider it as what satisfies your friend ; and I will answer for your thinking better and better of him as you know him more . His good sense and good principles would delight you .-- As far as the man is concerned , you could not wish your friend in better hands . His rank in society I would alter if I could , which is saying a great deal I assure you , Emma .-- You laugh at me about William Larkins ; but I could quite as ill spare Robert Martin ."""
austen#"He wanted her to look up and smile ; and having now brought herself not to smile too broadly -- she did -- cheerfully answering , "" You need not be at any pains to reconcile me to the match . I think Harriet is doing extremely well . _Her_ connexions may be worse than _his_ . In respectability of character , there can be no doubt that they are . I have been silent from surprize merely , excessive surprize ."
austen#"You cannot imagine how suddenly it has come on me ! how peculiarly unprepared I was !-- for I had reason to believe her very lately more determined against him , much more , than she was before ."" "" You ought to know your friend best ,"" replied Mr . Knightley ; "" but I should say she was a good - tempered , soft - hearted girl , not likely to be very , very determined against any young man who told her he loved her ."" Emma could not help laughing as she answered , "" Upon my word , I believe you know her quite as well as I do .-- But , Mr . Knightley , are you perfectly sure that she has absolutely and downright _accepted_ him . I could suppose she might in time -- but can she already ?-- Did not you misunderstand him ?-- You were both talking of other things ; of business , shows of cattle , or new drills -- and might not you , in the confusion of so many subjects , mistake him ?-- It was not Harriet ' s hand that he was certain of -- it was the dimensions of some famous ox ."" The contrast between the countenance and air of Mr . Knightley and Robert Martin was , at this moment , so strong to Emma ' s feelings , and so strong was the recollection of all that had so recently passed on Harriet ' s side , so fresh the sound of those words , spoken with such emphasis , "" No , I hope I know better than to think of Robert Martin ,"" that she was really expecting the intelligence to prove , in some measure , premature ."
austen#"It could not be otherwise . "" Do you dare say this ?"" cried Mr . Knightley . "" Do you dare to suppose me so great a blockhead , as not to know what a man is talking of ?-- What do you deserve ?"" "" Oh ! I always deserve the best treatment , because I never put up with any other ; and , therefore , you must give me a plain , direct answer ."
austen#"Are you quite sure that you understand the terms on which Mr . Martin and Harriet now are ?"" "" I am quite sure ,"" he replied , speaking very distinctly , "" that he told me she had accepted him ; and that there was no obscurity , nothing doubtful , in the words he used ; and I think I can give you a proof that it must be so . He asked my opinion as to what he was now to do . He knew of no one but Mrs . Goddard to whom he could apply for information of her relations or friends . Could I mention any thing more fit to be done , than to go to Mrs . Goddard ? I assured him that I could not ."
austen#"Then , he said , he would endeavour to see her in the course of this day ."" "" I am perfectly satisfied ,"" replied Emma , with the brightest smiles , "" and most sincerely wish them happy ."" "" You are materially changed since we talked on this subject before ."" "" I hope so -- for at that time I was a fool ."" "" And I am changed also ; for I am now very willing to grant you all Harriet ' s good qualities . I have taken some pains for your sake , and for Robert Martin ' s sake , ( whom I have always had reason to believe as much in love with her as ever ,) to get acquainted with her ."
austen#"I have often talked to her a good deal . You must have seen that I did . Sometimes , indeed , I have thought you were half suspecting me of pleading poor Martin ' s cause , which was never the case ; but , from all my observations , I am convinced of her being an artless , amiable girl , with very good notions , very seriously good principles , and placing her happiness in the affections and utility of domestic life .-- Much of this , I have no doubt , she may thank you for ."" "" Me !"" cried Emma , shaking her head .--"" Ah ! poor Harriet !"""
austen#She checked herself , however , and submitted quietly to a little more praise than she deserved . Their conversation was soon afterwards closed by the entrance of her father . She was not sorry . She wanted to be alone . Her mind was in a state of flutter and wonder , which made it impossible for her to be collected . She was in dancing , singing , exclaiming spirits ; and till she had moved about , and talked to herself , and laughed and reflected , she could be fit for nothing rational .
austen#Her father ' s business was to announce James ' s being gone out to put the horses to , preparatory to their now daily drive to Randalls ; and she had , therefore , an immediate excuse for disappearing . The joy , the gratitude , the exquisite delight of her sensations may be imagined . The sole grievance and alloy thus removed in the prospect of Harriet ' s welfare , she was really in danger of becoming too happy for security .-- What had she to wish for ? Nothing , but to grow more worthy of him , whose intentions and judgment had been ever so superior to her own . Nothing , but that the lessons of her past folly might teach her humility and circumspection in future . Serious she was , very serious in her thankfulness , and in her resolutions ; and yet there was no preventing a laugh , sometimes in the very midst of them .
austen#She must laugh at such a close ! Such an end of the doleful disappointment of five weeks back ! Such a heart -- such a Harriet ! Now there would be pleasure in her returning -- Every thing would be a pleasure . It would be a great pleasure to know Robert Martin . High in the rank of her most serious and heartfelt felicities , was the reflection that all necessity of concealment from Mr . Knightley would soon be over .
austen#"The disguise , equivocation , mystery , so hateful to her to practise , might soon be over . She could now look forward to giving him that full and perfect confidence which her disposition was most ready to welcome as a duty . In the gayest and happiest spirits she set forward with her father ; not always listening , but always agreeing to what he said ; and , whether in speech or silence , conniving at the comfortable persuasion of his being obliged to go to Randalls every day , or poor Mrs . Weston would be disappointed . They arrived .-- Mrs . Weston was alone in the drawing - room :-- but hardly had they been told of the baby , and Mr . Woodhouse received the thanks for coming , which he asked for , when a glimpse was caught through the blind , of two figures passing near the window . "" It is Frank and Miss Fairfax ,"" said Mrs . Weston ."
austen#""" I was just going to tell you of our agreeable surprize in seeing him arrive this morning . He stays till to - morrow , and Miss Fairfax has been persuaded to spend the day with us .-- They are coming in , I hope ."" In half a minute they were in the room . Emma was extremely glad to see him -- but there was a degree of confusion -- a number of embarrassing recollections on each side . They met readily and smiling , but with a consciousness which at first allowed little to be said ; and having all sat down again , there was for some time such a blank in the circle , that Emma began to doubt whether the wish now indulged , which she had long felt , of seeing Frank Churchill once more , and of seeing him with Jane , would yield its proportion of pleasure . When Mr . Weston joined the party , however , and when the baby was fetched , there was no longer a want of subject or animation -- or of courage and opportunity for Frank Churchill to draw near her and say ,"
austen#""" I have to thank you , Miss Woodhouse , for a very kind forgiving message in one of Mrs . Weston ' s letters . I hope time has not made you less willing to pardon . I hope you do not retract what you then said ."" "" No , indeed ,"" cried Emma , most happy to begin , "" not in the least . I am particularly glad to see and shake hands with you -- and to give you joy in person ."" He thanked her with all his heart , and continued some time to speak with serious feeling of his gratitude and happiness ."
austen#""" Is not she looking well ?"" said he , turning his eyes towards Jane . "" Better than she ever used to do ?-- You see how my father and Mrs . Weston doat upon her ."" But his spirits were soon rising again , and with laughing eyes , after mentioning the expected return of the Campbells , he named the name of Dixon .-- Emma blushed , and forbade its being pronounced in her hearing . "" I can never think of it ,"" she cried , "" without extreme shame ."" "" The shame ,"" he answered , "" is all mine , or ought to be ."
austen#"But is it possible that you had no suspicion ?-- I mean of late . Early , I know , you had none ."" "" I never had the smallest , I assure you ."" "" That appears quite wonderful . I was once very near -- and I wish I had -- it would have been better . But though I was always doing wrong things , they were very bad wrong things , and such as did me no service .-- It would have been a much better transgression had I broken the bond of secrecy and told you every thing ."""
austen#""" It is not now worth a regret ,"" said Emma . "" I have some hope ,"" resumed he , "" of my uncle ' s being persuaded to pay a visit at Randalls ; he wants to be introduced to her . When the Campbells are returned , we shall meet them in London , and continue there , I trust , till we may carry her northward .-- But now , I am at such a distance from her -- is not it hard , Miss Woodhouse ?-- Till this morning , we have not once met since the day of reconciliation . Do not you pity me ?"" Emma spoke her pity so very kindly , that with a sudden accession of gay thought , he cried , "" Ah !"
austen#"by the bye ,"" then sinking his voice , and looking demure for the moment --"" I hope Mr . Knightley is well ?"" He paused .-- She coloured and laughed .--"" I know you saw my letter , and think you may remember my wish in your favour . Let me return your congratulations .-- I assure you that I have heard the news with the warmest interest and satisfaction .-- He is a man whom I cannot presume to praise ."" Emma was delighted , and only wanted him to go on in the same style ; but his mind was the next moment in his own concerns and with his own Jane , and his next words were , "" Did you ever see such a skin ?-- such smoothness ! such delicacy !-- and yet without being actually fair .-- One cannot call her fair ."
austen#"It is a most uncommon complexion , with her dark eye - lashes and hair -- a most distinguishing complexion ! So peculiarly the lady in it .-- Just colour enough for beauty ."" "" I have always admired her complexion ,"" replied Emma , archly ; "" but do not I remember the time when you found fault with her for being so pale ?-- When we first began to talk of her .-- Have you quite forgotten ?"" "" Oh ! no -- what an impudent dog I was !-- How could I dare --"" But he laughed so heartily at the recollection , that Emma could not help saying ,"
austen#""" I do suspect that in the midst of your perplexities at that time , you had very great amusement in tricking us all .-- I am sure you had .-- I am sure it was a consolation to you ."" "" Oh ! no , no , no -- how can you suspect me of such a thing ? I was the most miserable wretch !"" "" Not quite so miserable as to be insensible to mirth . I am sure it was a source of high entertainment to you , to feel that you were taking us all in .-- Perhaps I am the readier to suspect , because , to tell you the truth , I think it might have been some amusement to myself in the same situation ."
austen#"I think there is a little likeness between us ."" He bowed . "" If not in our dispositions ,"" she presently added , with a look of true sensibility , "" there is a likeness in our destiny ; the destiny which bids fair to connect us with two characters so much superior to our own ."" "" True , true ,"" he answered , warmly . "" No , not true on your side . You can have no superior , but most true on mine .-- She is a complete angel ."
austen#Look at her . Is not she an angel in every gesture ? Observe the turn of her throat . Observe her eyes , as she is looking up at my father .-- You will be glad to hear ( inclining his head , and whispering seriously ) that my uncle means to give her all my aunt ' s jewels . They are to be new set . I am resolved to have some in an ornament for the head .
austen#"Will not it be beautiful in her dark hair ?"" "" Very beautiful , indeed ,"" replied Emma ; and she spoke so kindly , that he gratefully burst out , "" How delighted I am to see you again ! and to see you in such excellent looks !-- I would not have missed this meeting for the world . I should certainly have called at Hartfield , had you failed to come ."" The others had been talking of the child , Mrs . Weston giving an account of a little alarm she had been under , the evening before , from the infant ' s appearing not quite well ."
austen#"She believed she had been foolish , but it had alarmed her , and she had been within half a minute of sending for Mr . Perry . Perhaps she ought to be ashamed , but Mr . Weston had been almost as uneasy as herself .-- In ten minutes , however , the child had been perfectly well again . This was her history ; and particularly interesting it was to Mr . Woodhouse , who commended her very much for thinking of sending for Perry , and only regretted that she had not done it . "" She should always send for Perry , if the child appeared in the slightest degree disordered , were it only for a moment . She could not be too soon alarmed , nor send for Perry too often . It was a pity , perhaps , that he had not come last night ; for , though the child seemed well now , very well considering , it would probably have been better if Perry had seen it ."""
austen#"Frank Churchill caught the name . "" Perry !"" said he to Emma , and trying , as he spoke , to catch Miss Fairfax ' s eye . "" My friend Mr . Perry ! What are they saying about Mr . Perry ?-- Has he been here this morning ?-- And how does he travel now ?-- Has he set up his carriage ?"""
austen#"Emma soon recollected , and understood him ; and while she joined in the laugh , it was evident from Jane ' s countenance that she too was really hearing him , though trying to seem deaf . "" Such an extraordinary dream of mine !"" he cried . "" I can never think of it without laughing .-- She hears us , she hears us , Miss Woodhouse . I see it in her cheek , her smile , her vain attempt to frown . Look at her ."
austen#"Do not you see that , at this instant , the very passage of her own letter , which sent me the report , is passing under her eye -- that the whole blunder is spread before her -- that she can attend to nothing else , though pretending to listen to the others ?"" Jane was forced to smile completely , for a moment ; and the smile partly remained as she turned towards him , and said in a conscious , low , yet steady voice , "" How you can bear such recollections , is astonishing to me !-- They _will_ sometimes obtrude -- but how you can court them !"" He had a great deal to say in return , and very entertainingly ; but Emma ' s feelings were chiefly with Jane , in the argument ; and on leaving Randalls , and falling naturally into a comparison of the two men , she felt , that pleased as she had been to see Frank Churchill , and really regarding him as she did with friendship , she had never been more sensible of Mr . Knightley ' s high superiority of character . The happiness of this most happy day , received its completion , in the animated contemplation of his worth which this comparison produced . CHAPTER XIX"
austen#If Emma had still , at intervals , an anxious feeling for Harriet , a momentary doubt of its being possible for her to be really cured of her attachment to Mr . Knightley , and really able to accept another man from unbiased inclination , it was not long that she had to suffer from the recurrence of any such uncertainty . A very few days brought the party from London , and she had no sooner an opportunity of being one hour alone with Harriet , than she became perfectly satisfied -- unaccountable as it was !-- that Robert Martin had thoroughly supplanted Mr . Knightley , and was now forming all her views of happiness . Harriet was a little distressed -- did look a little foolish at first : but having once owned that she had been presumptuous and silly , and self - deceived , before , her pain and confusion seemed to die away with the words , and leave her without a care for the past , and with the fullest exultation in the present and future ; for , as to her friend ' s approbation , Emma had instantly removed every fear of that nature , by meeting her with the most unqualified congratulations .-- Harriet was most happy to give every particular of the evening at Astley ' s , and the dinner the next day ; she could dwell on it all with the utmost delight . But what did such particulars explain ?-- The fact was , as Emma could now acknowledge , that Harriet had always liked Robert Martin ; and that his continuing to love her had been irresistible .-- Beyond this , it must ever be unintelligible to Emma . The event , however , was most joyful ; and every day was giving her fresh reason for thinking so .-- Harriet ' s parentage became known . She proved to be the daughter of a tradesman , rich enough to afford her the comfortable maintenance which had ever been hers , and decent enough to have always wished for concealment .-- Such was the blood of gentility which Emma had formerly been so ready to vouch for !-- It was likely to be as untainted , perhaps , as the blood of many a gentleman : but what a connexion had she been preparing for Mr . Knightley -- or for the Churchills -- or even for Mr .
austen#Elton !-- The stain of illegitimacy , unbleached by nobility or wealth , would have been a stain indeed . No objection was raised on the father ' s side ; the young man was treated liberally ; it was all as it should be : and as Emma became acquainted with Robert Martin , who was now introduced at Hartfield , she fully acknowledged in him all the appearance of sense and worth which could bid fairest for her little friend . She had no doubt of Harriet ' s happiness with any good - tempered man ; but with him , and in the home he offered , there would be the hope of more , of security , stability , and improvement . She would be placed in the midst of those who loved her , and who had better sense than herself ; retired enough for safety , and occupied enough for cheerfulness . She would be never led into temptation , nor left for it to find her out . She would be respectable and happy ; and Emma admitted her to be the luckiest creature in the world , to have created so steady and persevering an affection in such a man ;-- or , if not quite the luckiest , to yield only to herself .
austen#Harriet , necessarily drawn away by her engagements with the Martins , was less and less at Hartfield ; which was not to be regretted .-- The intimacy between her and Emma must sink ; their friendship must change into a calmer sort of goodwill ; and , fortunately , what ought to be , and must be , seemed already beginning , and in the most gradual , natural manner . Before the end of September , Emma attended Harriet to church , and saw her hand bestowed on Robert Martin with so complete a satisfaction , as no remembrances , even connected with Mr . Elton as he stood before them , could impair .-- Perhaps , indeed , at that time she scarcely saw Mr . Elton , but as the clergyman whose blessing at the altar might next fall on herself .-- Robert Martin and Harriet Smith , the latest couple engaged of the three , were the first to be married . Jane Fairfax had already quitted Highbury , and was restored to the comforts of her beloved home with the Campbells .-- The Mr . Churchills were also in town ; and they were only waiting for November . The intermediate month was the one fixed on , as far as they dared , by Emma and Mr . Knightley .-- They had determined that their marriage ought to be concluded while John and Isabella were still at Hartfield , to allow them the fortnight ' s absence in a tour to the seaside , which was the plan .-- John and Isabella , and every other friend , were agreed in approving it . But Mr . Woodhouse -- how was Mr . Woodhouse to be induced to consent ?-- he , who had never yet alluded to their marriage but as a distant event .
austen#When first sounded on the subject , he was so miserable , that they were almost hopeless .-- A second allusion , indeed , gave less pain .-- He began to think it was to be , and that he could not prevent it -- a very promising step of the mind on its way to resignation . Still , however , he was not happy . Nay , he appeared so much otherwise , that his daughter ' s courage failed . She could not bear to see him suffering , to know him fancying himself neglected ; and though her understanding almost acquiesced in the assurance of both the Mr . Knightleys , that when once the event were over , his distress would be soon over too , she hesitated -- she could not proceed . In this state of suspense they were befriended , not by any sudden illumination of Mr . Woodhouse ' s mind , or any wonderful change of his nervous system , but by the operation of the same system in another way .-- Mrs . Weston ' s poultry - house was robbed one night of all her turkeys -- evidently by the ingenuity of man . Other poultry - yards in the neighbourhood also suffered .-- Pilfering was _housebreaking_ to Mr . Woodhouse ' s fears .-- He was very uneasy ; and but for the sense of his son - in - law ' s protection , would have been under wretched alarm every night of his life .
austen#"The strength , resolution , and presence of mind of the Mr . Knightleys , commanded his fullest dependence . While either of them protected him and his , Hartfield was safe .-- But Mr . John Knightley must be in London again by the end of the first week in November . The result of this distress was , that , with a much more voluntary , cheerful consent than his daughter had ever presumed to hope for at the moment , she was able to fix her wedding - day -- and Mr . Elton was called on , within a month from the marriage of Mr . and Mrs . Robert Martin , to join the hands of Mr . Knightley and Miss Woodhouse . The wedding was very much like other weddings , where the parties have no taste for finery or parade ; and Mrs . Elton , from the particulars detailed by her husband , thought it all extremely shabby , and very inferior to her own .--"" Very little white satin , very few lace veils ; a most pitiful business !-- Selina would stare when she heard of it ."" -- But , in spite of these deficiencies , the wishes , the hopes , the confidence , the predictions of the small band of true friends who witnessed the ceremony , were fully answered in the perfect happiness of the union . FINIS"
austen#""" The whole history ,"" repeated Anne , laughing . "" She could not make a very long history , I think , of one such little article of unfounded news ."" Mrs Smith said nothing . "" But ,"" continued Anne , presently , "" though there is no truth in my having this claim on Mr Elliot , I should be extremely happy to be of use to you in any way that I could . Shall I mention to him your being in Bath ? Shall I take any message ?"""
austen#""" No , I thank you : no , certainly not . In the warmth of the moment , and under a mistaken impression , I might , perhaps , have endeavoured to interest you in some circumstances ; but not now . No , I thank you , I have nothing to trouble you with ."" "" I think you spoke of having known Mr Elliot many years ?"" "" I did ."" "" Not before he was married , I suppose ?"""
austen#""" Yes ; he was not married when I knew him first ."" "" And -- were you much acquainted ?"" "" Intimately ."" "" Indeed ! Then do tell me what he was at that time of life . I have a great curiosity to know what Mr Elliot was as a very young man ."
austen#"Was he at all such as he appears now ?"" "" I have not seen Mr Elliot these three years ,"" was Mrs Smith ' s answer , given so gravely that it was impossible to pursue the subject farther ; and Anne felt that she had gained nothing but an increase of curiosity . They were both silent : Mrs Smith very thoughtful . At last -- "" I beg your pardon , my dear Miss Elliot ,"" she cried , in her natural tone of cordiality , "" I beg your pardon for the short answers I have been giving you , but I have been uncertain what I ought to do . I have been doubting and considering as to what I ought to tell you ."
austen#There were many things to be taken into the account . One hates to be officious , to be giving bad impressions , making mischief . Even the smooth surface of family - union seems worth preserving , though there may be nothing durable beneath . However , I have determined ; I think I am right ; I think you ought to be made acquainted with Mr Elliot ' s real character . Though I fully believe that , at present , you have not the smallest intention of accepting him , there is no saying what may happen . You might , some time or other , be differently affected towards him .
austen#Hear the truth , therefore , now , while you are unprejudiced . Mr Elliot is a man without heart or conscience ; a designing , wary , cold - blooded being , who thinks only of himself ; whom for his own interest or ease , would be guilty of any cruelty , or any treachery , that could be perpetrated without risk of his general character . He has no feeling for others . Those whom he has been the chief cause of leading into ruin , he can neglect and desert without the smallest compunction . He is totally beyond the reach of any sentiment of justice or compassion . Oh !
austen#"he is black at heart , hollow and black !"" Anne ' s astonished air , and exclamation of wonder , made her pause , and in a calmer manner , she added , "" My expressions startle you . You must allow for an injured , angry woman . But I will try to command myself . I will not abuse him ."
austen#I will only tell you what I have found him . Facts shall speak . He was the intimate friend of my dear husband , who trusted and loved him , and thought him as good as himself . The intimacy had been formed before our marriage . I found them most intimate friends ; and I , too , became excessively pleased with Mr Elliot , and entertained the highest opinion of him . At nineteen , you know , one does not think very seriously ; but Mr Elliot appeared to me quite as good as others , and much more agreeable than most others , and we were almost always together .
austen#"We were principally in town , living in very good style . He was then the inferior in circumstances ; he was then the poor one ; he had chambers in the Temple , and it was as much as he could do to support the appearance of a gentleman . He had always a home with us whenever he chose it ; he was always welcome ; he was like a brother . My poor Charles , who had the finest , most generous spirit in the world , would have divided his last farthing with him ; and I know that his purse was open to him ; I know that he often assisted him ."" "" This must have been about that very period of Mr Elliot ' s life ,"" said Anne , "" which has always excited my particular curiosity . It must have been about the same time that he became known to my father and sister ."
austen#"I never knew him myself ; I only heard of him ; but there was a something in his conduct then , with regard to my father and sister , and afterwards in the circumstances of his marriage , which I never could quite reconcile with present times . It seemed to announce a different sort of man ."" "" I know it all , I know it all ,"" cried Mrs Smith . "" He had been introduced to Sir Walter and your sister before I was acquainted with him , but I heard him speak of them for ever . I know he was invited and encouraged , and I know he did not choose to go . I can satisfy you , perhaps , on points which you would little expect ; and as to his marriage , I knew all about it at the time ."
austen#"I was privy to all the fors and againsts ; I was the friend to whom he confided his hopes and plans ; and though I did not know his wife previously , her inferior situation in society , indeed , rendered that impossible , yet I knew her all her life afterwards , or at least till within the last two years of her life , and can answer any question you may wish to put ."" "" Nay ,"" said Anne , "" I have no particular enquiry to make about her . I have always understood they were not a happy couple . But I should like to know why , at that time of his life , he should slight my father ' s acquaintance as he did . My father was certainly disposed to take very kind and proper notice of him . Why did Mr Elliot draw back ?"""
austen#""" Mr Elliot ,"" replied Mrs Smith , "" at that period of his life , had one object in view : to make his fortune , and by a rather quicker process than the law . He was determined to make it by marriage . He was determined , at least , not to mar it by an imprudent marriage ; and I know it was his belief ( whether justly or not , of course I cannot decide ), that your father and sister , in their civilities and invitations , were designing a match between the heir and the young lady , and it was impossible that such a match should have answered his ideas of wealth and independence . That was his motive for drawing back , I can assure you . He told me the whole story . He had no concealments with me ."
austen#"It was curious , that having just left you behind me in Bath , my first and principal acquaintance on marrying should be your cousin ; and that , through him , I should be continually hearing of your father and sister . He described one Miss Elliot , and I thought very affectionately of the other ."" "" Perhaps ,"" cried Anne , struck by a sudden idea , "" you sometimes spoke of me to Mr Elliot ?"" "" To be sure I did ; very often . I used to boast of my own Anne Elliot , and vouch for your being a very different creature from --"" She checked herself just in time ."
austen#""" This accounts for something which Mr Elliot said last night ,"" cried Anne . "" This explains it . I found he had been used to hear of me . I could not comprehend how . What wild imaginations one forms where dear self is concerned ! How sure to be mistaken !"
austen#"But I beg your pardon ; I have interrupted you . Mr Elliot married then completely for money ? The circumstances , probably , which first opened your eyes to his character ."" Mrs Smith hesitated a little here . "" Oh ! those things are too common ."
austen#"When one lives in the world , a man or woman ' s marrying for money is too common to strike one as it ought . I was very young , and associated only with the young , and we were a thoughtless , gay set , without any strict rules of conduct . We lived for enjoyment . I think differently now ; time and sickness and sorrow have given me other notions ; but at that period I must own I saw nothing reprehensible in what Mr Elliot was doing . ` To do the best for himself ,' passed as a duty ."" "" But was not she a very low woman ?"""
austen#""" Yes ; which I objected to , but he would not regard . Money , money , was all that he wanted . Her father was a grazier , her grandfather had been a butcher , but that was all nothing . She was a fine woman , had had a decent education , was brought forward by some cousins , thrown by chance into Mr Elliot ' s company , and fell in love with him ; and not a difficulty or a scruple was there on his side , with respect to her birth . All his caution was spent in being secured of the real amount of her fortune , before he committed himself . Depend upon it , whatever esteem Mr Elliot may have for his own situation in life now , as a young man he had not the smallest value for it ."
austen#"His chance for the Kellynch estate was something , but all the honour of the family he held as cheap as dirt . I have often heard him declare , that if baronetcies were saleable , anybody should have his for fifty pounds , arms and motto , name and livery included ; but I will not pretend to repeat half that I used to hear him say on that subject . It would not be fair ; and yet you ought to have proof , for what is all this but assertion , and you shall have proof ."" "" Indeed , my dear Mrs Smith , I want none ,"" cried Anne . "" You have asserted nothing contradictory to what Mr Elliot appeared to be some years ago . This is all in confirmation , rather , of what we used to hear and believe ."
austen#"I am more curious to know why he should be so different now ."" "" But for my satisfaction , if you will have the goodness to ring for Mary ; stay : I am sure you will have the still greater goodness of going yourself into my bedroom , and bringing me the small inlaid box which you will find on the upper shelf of the closet ."" Anne , seeing her friend to be earnestly bent on it , did as she was desired . The box was brought and placed before her , and Mrs Smith , sighing over it as she unlocked it , said -- "" This is full of papers belonging to him , to my husband ; a small portion only of what I had to look over when I lost him . The letter I am looking for was one written by Mr Elliot to him before our marriage , and happened to be saved ; why , one can hardly imagine ."
austen#"But he was careless and immethodical , like other men , about those things ; and when I came to examine his papers , I found it with others still more trivial , from different people scattered here and there , while many letters and memorandums of real importance had been destroyed . Here it is ; I would not burn it , because being even then very little satisfied with Mr Elliot , I was determined to preserve every document of former intimacy . I have now another motive for being glad that I can produce it ."" This was the letter , directed to "" Charles Smith , Esq . Tunbridge Wells ,"" and dated from London , as far back as July , 1803 : -- "" Dear Smith ,-- I have received yours ."
austen#Your kindness almost overpowers me . I wish nature had made such hearts as yours more common , but I have lived three - and - twenty years in the world , and have seen none like it . At present , believe me , I have no need of your services , being in cash again . Give me joy : I have got rid of Sir Walter and Miss . They are gone back to Kellynch , and almost made me swear to visit them this summer ; but my first visit to Kellynch will be with a surveyor , to tell me how to bring it with best advantage to the hammer . The baronet , nevertheless , is not unlikely to marry again ; he is quite fool enough .
austen#"If he does , however , they will leave me in peace , which may be a decent equivalent for the reversion . He is worse than last year . "" I wish I had any name but Elliot . I am sick of it . The name of Walter I can drop , thank God ! and I desire you will never insult me with my second W . again , meaning , for the rest of my life , to be only yours truly ,-- Wm ."
austen#"Elliot ."" Such a letter could not be read without putting Anne in a glow ; and Mrs Smith , observing the high colour in her face , said -- "" The language , I know , is highly disrespectful . Though I have forgot the exact terms , I have a perfect impression of the general meaning . But it shows you the man . Mark his professions to my poor husband ."
austen#"Can any thing be stronger ?"" Anne could not immediately get over the shock and mortification of finding such words applied to her father . She was obliged to recollect that her seeing the letter was a violation of the laws of honour , that no one ought to be judged or to be known by such testimonies , that no private correspondence could bear the eye of others , before she could recover calmness enough to return the letter which she had been meditating over , and say -- "" Thank you . This is full proof undoubtedly ; proof of every thing you were saying . But why be acquainted with us now ?"""
austen#""" I can explain this too ,"" cried Mrs Smith , smiling . "" Can you really ?"" "" Yes . I have shewn you Mr Elliot as he was a dozen years ago , and I will shew him as he is now . I cannot produce written proof again , but I can give as authentic oral testimony as you can desire , of what he is now wanting , and what he is now doing . He is no hypocrite now ."
austen#"He truly wants to marry you . His present attentions to your family are very sincere : quite from the heart . I will give you my authority : his friend Colonel Wallis ."" "" Colonel Wallis ! you are acquainted with him ?"" "" No ."
austen#"It does not come to me in quite so direct a line as that ; it takes a bend or two , but nothing of consequence . The stream is as good as at first ; the little rubbish it collects in the turnings is easily moved away . Mr Elliot talks unreservedly to Colonel Wallis of his views on you , which said Colonel Wallis , I imagine to be , in himself , a sensible , careful , discerning sort of character ; but Colonel Wallis has a very pretty silly wife , to whom he tells things which he had better not , and he repeats it all to her . She in the overflowing spirits of her recovery , repeats it all to her nurse ; and the nurse knowing my acquaintance with you , very naturally brings it all to me . On Monday evening , my good friend Mrs Rooke let me thus much into the secrets of Marlborough Buildings . When I talked of a whole history , therefore , you see I was not romancing so much as you supposed ."""
austen#""" My dear Mrs Smith , your authority is deficient . This will not do . Mr Elliot ' s having any views on me will not in the least account for the efforts he made towards a reconciliation with my father . That was all prior to my coming to Bath . I found them on the most friendly terms when I arrived ."" "" I know you did ; I know it all perfectly , but --"""
austen#""" Indeed , Mrs Smith , we must not expect to get real information in such a line . Facts or opinions which are to pass through the hands of so many , to be misconceived by folly in one , and ignorance in another , can hardly have much truth left ."" "" Only give me a hearing . You will soon be able to judge of the general credit due , by listening to some particulars which you can yourself immediately contradict or confirm . Nobody supposes that you were his first inducement . He had seen you indeed , before he came to Bath , and admired you , but without knowing it to be you ."
austen#"So says my historian , at least . Is this true ? Did he see you last summer or autumn , ` somewhere down in the west ,' to use her own words , without knowing it to be you ?"" "" He certainly did . So far it is very true . At Lyme ."
austen#"I happened to be at Lyme ."" "" Well ,"" continued Mrs Smith , triumphantly , "" grant my friend the credit due to the establishment of the first point asserted . He saw you then at Lyme , and liked you so well as to be exceedingly pleased to meet with you again in Camden Place , as Miss Anne Elliot , and from that moment , I have no doubt , had a double motive in his visits there . But there was another , and an earlier , which I will now explain . If there is anything in my story which you know to be either false or improbable , stop me . My account states , that your sister ' s friend , the lady now staying with you , whom I have heard you mention , came to Bath with Miss Elliot and Sir Walter as long ago as September ( in short when they first came themselves ), and has been staying there ever since ; that she is a clever , insinuating , handsome woman , poor and plausible , and altogether such in situation and manner , as to give a general idea , among Sir Walter ' s acquaintance , of her meaning to be Lady Elliot , and as general a surprise that Miss Elliot should be apparently , blind to the danger ."""
austen#"Here Mrs Smith paused a moment ; but Anne had not a word to say , and she continued -- "" This was the light in which it appeared to those who knew the family , long before you returned to it ; and Colonel Wallis had his eye upon your father enough to be sensible of it , though he did not then visit in Camden Place ; but his regard for Mr Elliot gave him an interest in watching all that was going on there , and when Mr Elliot came to Bath for a day or two , as he happened to do a little before Christmas , Colonel Wallis made him acquainted with the appearance of things , and the reports beginning to prevail . Now you are to understand , that time had worked a very material change in Mr Elliot ' s opinions as to the value of a baronetcy . Upon all points of blood and connexion he is a completely altered man . Having long had as much money as he could spend , nothing to wish for on the side of avarice or indulgence , he has been gradually learning to pin his happiness upon the consequence he is heir to . I thought it coming on before our acquaintance ceased , but it is now a confirmed feeling ."
austen#He cannot bear the idea of not being Sir William . You may guess , therefore , that the news he heard from his friend could not be very agreeable , and you may guess what it produced ; the resolution of coming back to Bath as soon as possible , and of fixing himself here for a time , with the view of renewing his former acquaintance , and recovering such a footing in the family as might give him the means of ascertaining the degree of his danger , and of circumventing the lady if he found it material . This was agreed upon between the two friends as the only thing to be done ; and Colonel Wallis was to assist in every way that he could . He was to be introduced , and Mrs Wallis was to be introduced , and everybody was to be introduced . Mr Elliot came back accordingly ; and on application was forgiven , as you know , and re - admitted into the family ; and there it was his constant object , and his only object ( till your arrival added another motive ), to watch Sir Walter and Mrs Clay . He omitted no opportunity of being with them , threw himself in their way , called at all hours ; but I need not be particular on this subject .
austen#"You can imagine what an artful man would do ; and with this guide , perhaps , may recollect what you have seen him do ."" "" Yes ,"" said Anne , "" you tell me nothing which does not accord with what I have known , or could imagine . There is always something offensive in the details of cunning . The manoeuvres of selfishness and duplicity must ever be revolting , but I have heard nothing which really surprises me . I know those who would be shocked by such a representation of Mr Elliot , who would have difficulty in believing it ; but I have never been satisfied . I have always wanted some other motive for his conduct than appeared ."
austen#"I should like to know his present opinion , as to the probability of the event he has been in dread of ; whether he considers the danger to be lessening or not ."" "" Lessening , I understand ,"" replied Mrs Smith . "" He thinks Mrs Clay afraid of him , aware that he sees through her , and not daring to proceed as she might do in his absence . But since he must be absent some time or other , I do not perceive how he can ever be secure while she holds her present influence . Mrs Wallis has an amusing idea , as nurse tells me , that it is to be put into the marriage articles when you and Mr Elliot marry , that your father is not to marry Mrs Clay . A scheme , worthy of Mrs Wallis ' s understanding , by all accounts ; but my sensible nurse Rooke sees the absurdity of it ."
austen#"` Why , to be sure , ma ' am ,' said she , ` it would not prevent his marrying anybody else .' And , indeed , to own the truth , I do not think nurse , in her heart , is a very strenuous opposer of Sir Walter ' s making a second match . She must be allowed to be a favourer of matrimony , you know ; and ( since self will intrude ) who can say that she may not have some flying visions of attending the next Lady Elliot , through Mrs Wallis ' s recommendation ?"" "" I am very glad to know all this ,"" said Anne , after a little thoughtfulness . "" It will be more painful to me in some respects to be in company with him , but I shall know better what to do . My line of conduct will be more direct ."
austen#"Mr Elliot is evidently a disingenuous , artificial , worldly man , who has never had any better principle to guide him than selfishness ."" But Mr Elliot was not done with . Mrs Smith had been carried away from her first direction , and Anne had forgotten , in the interest of her own family concerns , how much had been originally implied against him ; but her attention was now called to the explanation of those first hints , and she listened to a recital which , if it did not perfectly justify the unqualified bitterness of Mrs Smith , proved him to have been very unfeeling in his conduct towards her ; very deficient both in justice and compassion . She learned that ( the intimacy between them continuing unimpaired by Mr Elliot ' s marriage ) they had been as before always together , and Mr Elliot had led his friend into expenses much beyond his fortune . Mrs Smith did not want to take blame to herself , and was most tender of throwing any on her husband ; but Anne could collect that their income had never been equal to their style of living , and that from the first there had been a great deal of general and joint extravagance . From his wife ' s account of him she could discern Mr Smith to have been a man of warm feelings , easy temper , careless habits , and not strong understanding , much more amiable than his friend , and very unlike him , led by him , and probably despised by him ."
austen#Mr Elliot , raised by his marriage to great affluence , and disposed to every gratification of pleasure and vanity which could be commanded without involving himself , ( for with all his self - indulgence he had become a prudent man ), and beginning to be rich , just as his friend ought to have found himself to be poor , seemed to have had no concern at all for that friend ' s probable finances , but , on the contrary , had been prompting and encouraging expenses which could end only in ruin ; and the Smiths accordingly had been ruined . The husband had died just in time to be spared the full knowledge of it . They had previously known embarrassments enough to try the friendship of their friends , and to prove that Mr Elliot ' s had better not be tried ; but it was not till his death that the wretched state of his affairs was fully known . With a confidence in Mr Elliot ' s regard , more creditable to his feelings than his judgement , Mr Smith had appointed him the executor of his will ; but Mr Elliot would not act , and the difficulties and distress which this refusal had heaped on her , in addition to the inevitable sufferings of her situation , had been such as could not be related without anguish of spirit , or listened to without corresponding indignation . Anne was shewn some letters of his on the occasion , answers to urgent applications from Mrs Smith , which all breathed the same stern resolution of not engaging in a fruitless trouble , and , under a cold civility , the same hard - hearted indifference to any of the evils it might bring on her . It was a dreadful picture of ingratitude and inhumanity ; and Anne felt , at some moments , that no flagrant open crime could have been worse .
austen#She had a great deal to listen to ; all the particulars of past sad scenes , all the minutiae of distress upon distress , which in former conversations had been merely hinted at , were dwelt on now with a natural indulgence . Anne could perfectly comprehend the exquisite relief , and was only the more inclined to wonder at the composure of her friend ' s usual state of mind . There was one circumstance in the history of her grievances of particular irritation . She had good reason to believe that some property of her husband in the West Indies , which had been for many years under a sort of sequestration for the payment of its own incumbrances , might be recoverable by proper measures ; and this property , though not large , would be enough to make her comparatively rich . But there was nobody to stir in it . Mr Elliot would do nothing , and she could do nothing herself , equally disabled from personal exertion by her state of bodily weakness , and from employing others by her want of money .
austen#She had no natural connexions to assist her even with their counsel , and she could not afford to purchase the assistance of the law . This was a cruel aggravation of actually straitened means . To feel that she ought to be in better circumstances , that a little trouble in the right place might do it , and to fear that delay might be even weakening her claims , was hard to bear . It was on this point that she had hoped to engage Anne ' s good offices with Mr Elliot . She had previously , in the anticipation of their marriage , been very apprehensive of losing her friend by it ; but on being assured that he could have made no attempt of that nature , since he did not even know her to be in Bath , it immediately occurred , that something might be done in her favour by the influence of the woman he loved , and she had been hastily preparing to interest Anne ' s feelings , as far as the observances due to Mr Elliot ' s character would allow , when Anne ' s refutation of the supposed engagement changed the face of everything ; and while it took from her the new - formed hope of succeeding in the object of her first anxiety , left her at least the comfort of telling the whole story her own way . After listening to this full description of Mr Elliot , Anne could not but express some surprise at Mrs Smith ' s having spoken of him so favourably in the beginning of their conversation .
austen#""" She had seemed to recommend and praise him !"" "" My dear ,"" was Mrs Smith ' s reply , "" there was nothing else to be done . I considered your marrying him as certain , though he might not yet have made the offer , and I could no more speak the truth of him , than if he had been your husband . My heart bled for you , as I talked of happiness ; and yet he is sensible , he is agreeable , and with such a woman as you , it was not absolutely hopeless . He was very unkind to his first wife . They were wretched together ."
austen#"But she was too ignorant and giddy for respect , and he had never loved her . I was willing to hope that you must fare better ."" Anne could just acknowledge within herself such a possibility of having been induced to marry him , as made her shudder at the idea of the misery which must have followed . It was just possible that she might have been persuaded by Lady Russell ! And under such a supposition , which would have been most miserable , when time had disclosed all , too late ? It was very desirable that Lady Russell should be no longer deceived ; and one of the concluding arrangements of this important conference , which carried them through the greater part of the morning , was , that Anne had full liberty to communicate to her friend everything relative to Mrs Smith , in which his conduct was involved ."
austen#Chapter 22 Anne went home to think over all that she had heard . In one point , her feelings were relieved by this knowledge of Mr Elliot . There was no longer anything of tenderness due to him . He stood as opposed to Captain Wentworth , in all his own unwelcome obtrusiveness ; and the evil of his attentions last night , the irremediable mischief he might have done , was considered with sensations unqualified , unperplexed . Pity for him was all over .
austen#But this was the only point of relief . In every other respect , in looking around her , or penetrating forward , she saw more to distrust and to apprehend . She was concerned for the disappointment and pain Lady Russell would be feeling ; for the mortifications which must be hanging over her father and sister , and had all the distress of foreseeing many evils , without knowing how to avert any one of them . She was most thankful for her own knowledge of him . She had never considered herself as entitled to reward for not slighting an old friend like Mrs Smith , but here was a reward indeed springing from it ! Mrs Smith had been able to tell her what no one else could have done .
austen#"Could the knowledge have been extended through her family ? But this was a vain idea . She must talk to Lady Russell , tell her , consult with her , and having done her best , wait the event with as much composure as possible ; and after all , her greatest want of composure would be in that quarter of the mind which could not be opened to Lady Russell ; in that flow of anxieties and fears which must be all to herself . She found , on reaching home , that she had , as she intended , escaped seeing Mr Elliot ; that he had called and paid them a long morning visit ; but hardly had she congratulated herself , and felt safe , when she heard that he was coming again in the evening . "" I had not the smallest intention of asking him ,"" said Elizabeth , with affected carelessness , "" but he gave so many hints ; so Mrs Clay says , at least ."" "" Indeed , I do say it ."
austen#"I never saw anybody in my life spell harder for an invitation . Poor man ! I was really in pain for him ; for your hard - hearted sister , Miss Anne , seems bent on cruelty ."" "" Oh !"" cried Elizabeth , "" I have been rather too much used to the game to be soon overcome by a gentleman ' s hints . However , when I found how excessively he was regretting that he should miss my father this morning , I gave way immediately , for I would never really omit an opportunity of bring him and Sir Walter together ."
austen#"They appear to so much advantage in company with each other . Each behaving so pleasantly . Mr Elliot looking up with so much respect ."" "" Quite delightful !"" cried Mrs Clay , not daring , however , to turn her eyes towards Anne . "" Exactly like father and son !"
austen#"Dear Miss Elliot , may I not say father and son ?"" "" Oh ! I lay no embargo on any body ' s words . If you will have such ideas ! But , upon my word , I am scarcely sensible of his attentions being beyond those of other men ."" "" My dear Miss Elliot !"""
austen#"exclaimed Mrs Clay , lifting her hands and eyes , and sinking all the rest of her astonishment in a convenient silence . "" Well , my dear Penelope , you need not be so alarmed about him . I did invite him , you know . I sent him away with smiles . When I found he was really going to his friends at Thornberry Park for the whole day to - morrow , I had compassion on him ."" Anne admired the good acting of the friend , in being able to shew such pleasure as she did , in the expectation and in the actual arrival of the very person whose presence must really be interfering with her prime object ."
austen#It was impossible but that Mrs Clay must hate the sight of Mr Elliot ; and yet she could assume a most obliging , placid look , and appear quite satisfied with the curtailed license of devoting herself only half as much to Sir Walter as she would have done otherwise . To Anne herself it was most distressing to see Mr Elliot enter the room ; and quite painful to have him approach and speak to her . She had been used before to feel that he could not be always quite sincere , but now she saw insincerity in everything . His attentive deference to her father , contrasted with his former language , was odious ; and when she thought of his cruel conduct towards Mrs Smith , she could hardly bear the sight of his present smiles and mildness , or the sound of his artificial good sentiments . She meant to avoid any such alteration of manners as might provoke a remonstrance on his side . It was a great object to her to escape all enquiry or eclat ; but it was her intention to be as decidedly cool to him as might be compatible with their relationship ; and to retrace , as quietly as she could , the few steps of unnecessary intimacy she had been gradually led along .
austen#She was accordingly more guarded , and more cool , than she had been the night before . He wanted to animate her curiosity again as to how and where he could have heard her formerly praised ; wanted very much to be gratified by more solicitation ; but the charm was broken : he found that the heat and animation of a public room was necessary to kindle his modest cousin ' s vanity ; he found , at least , that it was not to be done now , by any of those attempts which he could hazard among the too - commanding claims of the others . He little surmised that it was a subject acting now exactly against his interest , bringing immediately to her thoughts all those parts of his conduct which were least excusable . She had some satisfaction in finding that he was really going out of Bath the next morning , going early , and that he would be gone the greater part of two days . He was invited again to Camden Place the very evening of his return ; but from Thursday to Saturday evening his absence was certain . It was bad enough that a Mrs Clay should be always before her ; but that a deeper hypocrite should be added to their party , seemed the destruction of everything like peace and comfort .
austen#"It was so humiliating to reflect on the constant deception practised on her father and Elizabeth ; to consider the various sources of mortification preparing for them ! Mrs Clay ' s selfishness was not so complicate nor so revolting as his ; and Anne would have compounded for the marriage at once , with all its evils , to be clear of Mr Elliot ' s subtleties in endeavouring to prevent it . On Friday morning she meant to go very early to Lady Russell , and accomplish the necessary communication ; and she would have gone directly after breakfast , but that Mrs Clay was also going out on some obliging purpose of saving her sister trouble , which determined her to wait till she might be safe from such a companion . She saw Mrs Clay fairly off , therefore , before she began to talk of spending the morning in Rivers Street . "" Very well ,"" said Elizabeth , "" I have nothing to send but my love . Oh !"
austen#you may as well take back that tiresome book she would lend me , and pretend I have read it through . I really cannot be plaguing myself for ever with all the new poems and states of the nation that come out . Lady Russell quite bores one with her new publications . You need not tell her so , but I thought her dress hideous the other night . I used to think she had some taste in dress , but I was ashamed of her at the concert . Something so formal and arrange in her air !
austen#"and she sits so upright ! My best love , of course ."" "" And mine ,"" added Sir Walter . "" Kindest regards . And you may say , that I mean to call upon her soon . Make a civil message ; but I shall only leave my card ."
austen#"Morning visits are never fair by women at her time of life , who make themselves up so little . If she would only wear rouge she would not be afraid of being seen ; but last time I called , I observed the blinds were let down immediately ."" While her father spoke , there was a knock at the door . Who could it be ? Anne , remembering the preconcerted visits , at all hours , of Mr Elliot , would have expected him , but for his known engagement seven miles off . After the usual period of suspense , the usual sounds of approach were heard , and "" Mr and Mrs Charles Musgrove "" were ushered into the room ."
austen#Surprise was the strongest emotion raised by their appearance ; but Anne was really glad to see them ; and the others were not so sorry but that they could put on a decent air of welcome ; and as soon as it became clear that these , their nearest relations , were not arrived with an views of accommodation in that house , Sir Walter and Elizabeth were able to rise in cordiality , and do the honours of it very well . They were come to Bath for a few days with Mrs Musgrove , and were at the White Hart . So much was pretty soon understood ; but till Sir Walter and Elizabeth were walking Mary into the other drawing - room , and regaling themselves with her admiration , Anne could not draw upon Charles ' s brain for a regular history of their coming , or an explanation of some smiling hints of particular business , which had been ostentatiously dropped by Mary , as well as of some apparent confusion as to whom their party consisted of . She then found that it consisted of Mrs Musgrove , Henrietta , and Captain Harville , beside their two selves . He gave her a very plain , intelligible account of the whole ; a narration in which she saw a great deal of most characteristic proceeding . The scheme had received its first impulse by Captain Harville ' s wanting to come to Bath on business .
austen#He had begun to talk of it a week ago ; and by way of doing something , as shooting was over , Charles had proposed coming with him , and Mrs Harville had seemed to like the idea of it very much , as an advantage to her husband ; but Mary could not bear to be left , and had made herself so unhappy about it , that for a day or two everything seemed to be in suspense , or at an end . But then , it had been taken up by his father and mother . His mother had some old friends in Bath whom she wanted to see ; it was thought a good opportunity for Henrietta to come and buy wedding - clothes for herself and her sister ; and , in short , it ended in being his mother ' s party , that everything might be comfortable and easy to Captain Harville ; and he and Mary were included in it by way of general convenience . They had arrived late the night before . Mrs Harville , her children , and Captain Benwick , remained with Mr Musgrove and Louisa at Uppercross . Anne ' s only surprise was , that affairs should be in forwardness enough for Henrietta ' s wedding - clothes to be talked of .
austen#"She had imagined such difficulties of fortune to exist there as must prevent the marriage from being near at hand ; but she learned from Charles that , very recently , ( since Mary ' s last letter to herself ), Charles Hayter had been applied to by a friend to hold a living for a youth who could not possibly claim it under many years ; and that on the strength of his present income , with almost a certainty of something more permanent long before the term in question , the two families had consented to the young people ' s wishes , and that their marriage was likely to take place in a few months , quite as soon as Louisa ' s . "" And a very good living it was ,"" Charles added : "" only five - and - twenty miles from Uppercross , and in a very fine country : fine part of Dorsetshire . In the centre of some of the best preserves in the kingdom , surrounded by three great proprietors , each more careful and jealous than the other ; and to two of the three at least , Charles Hayter might get a special recommendation . Not that he will value it as he ought ,"" he observed , "" Charles is too cool about sporting . That ' s the worst of him ."" "" I am extremely glad , indeed ,"" cried Anne , "" particularly glad that this should happen ; and that of two sisters , who both deserve equally well , and who have always been such good friends , the pleasant prospect of one should not be dimming those of the other -- that they should be so equal in their prosperity and comfort ."
austen#"I hope your father and mother are quite happy with regard to both ."" "" Oh ! yes . My father would be well pleased if the gentlemen were richer , but he has no other fault to find . Money , you know , coming down with money -- two daughters at once -- it cannot be a very agreeable operation , and it streightens him as to many things . However , I do not mean to say they have not a right to it ."
austen#"It is very fit they should have daughters ' shares ; and I am sure he has always been a very kind , liberal father to me . Mary does not above half like Henrietta ' s match . She never did , you know . But she does not do him justice , nor think enough about Winthrop . I cannot make her attend to the value of the property . It is a very fair match , as times go ; and I have liked Charles Hayter all my life , and I shall not leave off now ."""
austen#""" Such excellent parents as Mr and Mrs Musgrove ,"" exclaimed Anne , "" should be happy in their children ' s marriages . They do everything to confer happiness , I am sure . What a blessing to young people to be in such hands ! Your father and mother seem so totally free from all those ambitious feelings which have led to so much misconduct and misery , both in young and old . I hope you think Louisa perfectly recovered now ?"" He answered rather hesitatingly , "" Yes , I believe I do ; very much recovered ; but she is altered ; there is no running or jumping about , no laughing or dancing ; it is quite different ."
austen#"If one happens only to shut the door a little hard , she starts and wriggles like a young dab - chick in the water ; and Benwick sits at her elbow , reading verses , or whispering to her , all day long ."" Anne could not help laughing . "" That cannot be much to your taste , I know ,"" said she ; "" but I do believe him to be an excellent young man ."" "" To be sure he is . Nobody doubts it ; and I hope you do not think I am so illiberal as to want every man to have the same objects and pleasures as myself . I have a great value for Benwick ; and when one can but get him to talk , he has plenty to say ."
austen#"His reading has done him no harm , for he has fought as well as read . He is a brave fellow . I got more acquainted with him last Monday than ever I did before . We had a famous set - to at rat - hunting all the morning in my father ' s great barns ; and he played his part so well that I have liked him the better ever since ."" Here they were interrupted by the absolute necessity of Charles ' s following the others to admire mirrors and china ; but Anne had heard enough to understand the present state of Uppercross , and rejoice in its happiness ; and though she sighed as she rejoiced , her sigh had none of the ill - will of envy in it . She would certainly have risen to their blessings if she could , but she did not want to lessen theirs ."
austen#The visit passed off altogether in high good humour . Mary was in excellent spirits , enjoying the gaiety and the change , and so well satisfied with the journey in her mother - in - law ' s carriage with four horses , and with her own complete independence of Camden Place , that she was exactly in a temper to admire everything as she ought , and enter most readily into all the superiorities of the house , as they were detailed to her . She had no demands on her father or sister , and her consequence was just enough increased by their handsome drawing - rooms . Elizabeth was , for a short time , suffering a good deal . She felt that Mrs Musgrove and all her party ought to be asked to dine with them ; but she could not bear to have the difference of style , the reduction of servants , which a dinner must betray , witnessed by those who had been always so inferior to the Elliots of Kellynch . It was a struggle between propriety and vanity ; but vanity got the better , and then Elizabeth was happy again .
austen#"These were her internal persuasions : "" Old fashioned notions ; country hospitality ; we do not profess to give dinners ; few people in Bath do ; Lady Alicia never does ; did not even ask her own sister ' s family , though they were here a month : and I dare say it would be very inconvenient to Mrs Musgrove ; put her quite out of her way . I am sure she would rather not come ; she cannot feel easy with us . I will ask them all for an evening ; that will be much better ; that will be a novelty and a treat . They have not seen two such drawing rooms before . They will be delighted to come to - morrow evening . It shall be a regular party , small , but most elegant ."""
austen#And this satisfied Elizabeth : and when the invitation was given to the two present , and promised for the absent , Mary was as completely satisfied . She was particularly asked to meet Mr Elliot , and be introduced to Lady Dalrymple and Miss Carteret , who were fortunately already engaged to come ; and she could not have received a more gratifying attention . Miss Elliot was to have the honour of calling on Mrs Musgrove in the course of the morning ; and Anne walked off with Charles and Mary , to go and see her and Henrietta directly . Her plan of sitting with Lady Russell must give way for the present . They all three called in Rivers Street for a couple of minutes ; but Anne convinced herself that a day ' s delay of the intended communication could be of no consequence , and hastened forward to the White Hart , to see again the friends and companions of the last autumn , with an eagerness of good - will which many associations contributed to form . They found Mrs Musgrove and her daughter within , and by themselves , and Anne had the kindest welcome from each .
austen#Henrietta was exactly in that state of recently - improved views , of fresh - formed happiness , which made her full of regard and interest for everybody she had ever liked before at all ; and Mrs Musgrove ' s real affection had been won by her usefulness when they were in distress . It was a heartiness , and a warmth , and a sincerity which Anne delighted in the more , from the sad want of such blessings at home . She was entreated to give them as much of her time as possible , invited for every day and all day long , or rather claimed as part of the family ; and , in return , she naturally fell into all her wonted ways of attention and assistance , and on Charles ' s leaving them together , was listening to Mrs Musgrove ' s history of Louisa , and to Henrietta ' s of herself , giving opinions on business , and recommendations to shops ; with intervals of every help which Mary required , from altering her ribbon to settling her accounts ; from finding her keys , and assorting her trinkets , to trying to convince her that she was not ill - used by anybody ; which Mary , well amused as she generally was , in her station at a window overlooking the entrance to the Pump Room , could not but have her moments of imagining . A morning of thorough confusion was to be expected . A large party in an hotel ensured a quick - changing , unsettled scene . One five minutes brought a note , the next a parcel ; and Anne had not been there half an hour , when their dining - room , spacious as it was , seemed more than half filled : a party of steady old friends were seated around Mrs Musgrove , and Charles came back with Captains Harville and Wentworth .
austen#"The appearance of the latter could not be more than the surprise of the moment . It was impossible for her to have forgotten to feel that this arrival of their common friends must be soon bringing them together again . Their last meeting had been most important in opening his feelings ; she had derived from it a delightful conviction ; but she feared from his looks , that the same unfortunate persuasion , which had hastened him away from the Concert Room , still governed . He did not seem to want to be near enough for conversation . She tried to be calm , and leave things to take their course , and tried to dwell much on this argument of rational dependence :-- "" Surely , if there be constant attachment on each side , our hearts must understand each other ere long . We are not boy and girl , to be captiously irritable , misled by every moment ' s inadvertence , and wantonly playing with our own happiness ."""
austen#"And yet , a few minutes afterwards , she felt as if their being in company with each other , under their present circumstances , could only be exposing them to inadvertencies and misconstructions of the most mischievous kind . "" Anne ,"" cried Mary , still at her window , "" there is Mrs Clay , I am sure , standing under the colonnade , and a gentleman with her . I saw them turn the corner from Bath Street just now . They seemed deep in talk . Who is it ? Come , and tell me ."
austen#"Good heavens ! I recollect . It is Mr Elliot himself ."" "" No ,"" cried Anne , quickly , "" it cannot be Mr Elliot , I assure you . He was to leave Bath at nine this morning , and does not come back till to - morrow ."" As she spoke , she felt that Captain Wentworth was looking at her , the consciousness of which vexed and embarrassed her , and made her regret that she had said so much , simple as it was ."
austen#"Mary , resenting that she should be supposed not to know her own cousin , began talking very warmly about the family features , and protesting still more positively that it was Mr Elliot , calling again upon Anne to come and look for herself , but Anne did not mean to stir , and tried to be cool and unconcerned . Her distress returned , however , on perceiving smiles and intelligent glances pass between two or three of the lady visitors , as if they believed themselves quite in the secret . It was evident that the report concerning her had spread , and a short pause succeeded , which seemed to ensure that it would now spread farther . "" Do come , Anne "" cried Mary , "" come and look yourself . You will be too late if you do not make haste . They are parting ; they are shaking hands ."
austen#"He is turning away . Not know Mr Elliot , indeed ! You seem to have forgot all about Lyme ."" To pacify Mary , and perhaps screen her own embarrassment , Anne did move quietly to the window . She was just in time to ascertain that it really was Mr Elliot , which she had never believed , before he disappeared on one side , as Mrs Clay walked quickly off on the other ; and checking the surprise which she could not but feel at such an appearance of friendly conference between two persons of totally opposite interest , she calmly said , "" Yes , it is Mr Elliot , certainly . He has changed his hour of going , I suppose , that is all , or I may be mistaken , I might not attend ;"" and walked back to her chair , recomposed , and with the comfortable hope of having acquitted herself well ."
austen#"The visitors took their leave ; and Charles , having civilly seen them off , and then made a face at them , and abused them for coming , began with -- "" Well , mother , I have done something for you that you will like . I have been to the theatre , and secured a box for to - morrow night . A ' n ' t I a good boy ? I know you love a play ; and there is room for us all . It holds nine ."
austen#"I have engaged Captain Wentworth . Anne will not be sorry to join us , I am sure . We all like a play . Have not I done well , mother ?"" Mrs Musgrove was good humouredly beginning to express her perfect readiness for the play , if Henrietta and all the others liked it , when Mary eagerly interrupted her by exclaiming -- "" Good heavens , Charles !"
austen#"how can you think of such a thing ? Take a box for to - morrow night ! Have you forgot that we are engaged to Camden Place to - morrow night ? and that we were most particularly asked to meet Lady Dalrymple and her daughter , and Mr Elliot , and all the principal family connexions , on purpose to be introduced to them ? How can you be so forgetful ?"" "" Phoo !"
austen#"phoo !"" replied Charles , "" what ' s an evening party ? Never worth remembering . Your father might have asked us to dinner , I think , if he had wanted to see us . You may do as you like , but I shall go to the play ."" "" Oh !"
austen#"Charles , I declare it will be too abominable if you do , when you promised to go ."" "" No , I did not promise . I only smirked and bowed , and said the word ` happy .' There was no promise ."" "" But you must go , Charles . It would be unpardonable to fail ."
austen#"We were asked on purpose to be introduced . There was always such a great connexion between the Dalrymples and ourselves . Nothing ever happened on either side that was not announced immediately . We are quite near relations , you know ; and Mr Elliot too , whom you ought so particularly to be acquainted with ! Every attention is due to Mr Elliot . Consider , my father ' s heir : the future representative of the family ."""
austen#""" Don ' t talk to me about heirs and representatives ,"" cried Charles . "" I am not one of those who neglect the reigning power to bow to the rising sun . If I would not go for the sake of your father , I should think it scandalous to go for the sake of his heir . What is Mr Elliot to me ?"" The careless expression was life to Anne , who saw that Captain Wentworth was all attention , looking and listening with his whole soul ; and that the last words brought his enquiring eyes from Charles to herself . Charles and Mary still talked on in the same style ; he , half serious and half jesting , maintaining the scheme for the play , and she , invariably serious , most warmly opposing it , and not omitting to make it known that , however determined to go to Camden Place herself , she should not think herself very well used , if they went to the play without her ."
austen#"Mrs Musgrove interposed . "" We had better put it off . Charles , you had much better go back and change the box for Tuesday . It would be a pity to be divided , and we should be losing Miss Anne , too , if there is a party at her father ' s ; and I am sure neither Henrietta nor I should care at all for the play , if Miss Anne could not be with us ."" Anne felt truly obliged to her for such kindness ; and quite as much so for the opportunity it gave her of decidedly saying -- "" If it depended only on my inclination , ma ' am , the party at home ( excepting on Mary ' s account ) would not be the smallest impediment ."
austen#"I have no pleasure in the sort of meeting , and should be too happy to change it for a play , and with you . But , it had better not be attempted , perhaps ."" She had spoken it ; but she trembled when it was done , conscious that her words were listened to , and daring not even to try to observe their effect . It was soon generally agreed that Tuesday should be the day ; Charles only reserving the advantage of still teasing his wife , by persisting that he would go to the play to - morrow if nobody else would . Captain Wentworth left his seat , and walked to the fire - place ; probably for the sake of walking away from it soon afterwards , and taking a station , with less bare - faced design , by Anne . "" You have not been long enough in Bath ,"" said he , "" to enjoy the evening parties of the place ."""
austen#""" Oh ! no . The usual character of them has nothing for me . I am no card - player ."" "" You were not formerly , I know . You did not use to like cards ; but time makes many changes ."""
austen#""" I am not yet so much changed ,"" cried Anne , and stopped , fearing she hardly knew what misconstruction . After waiting a few moments he said , and as if it were the result of immediate feeling , "" It is a period , indeed ! Eight years and a half is a period ."" Whether he would have proceeded farther was left to Anne ' s imagination to ponder over in a calmer hour ; for while still hearing the sounds he had uttered , she was startled to other subjects by Henrietta , eager to make use of the present leisure for getting out , and calling on her companions to lose no time , lest somebody else should come in . They were obliged to move . Anne talked of being perfectly ready , and tried to look it ; but she felt that could Henrietta have known the regret and reluctance of her heart in quitting that chair , in preparing to quit the room , she would have found , in all her own sensations for her cousin , in the very security of his affection , wherewith to pity her ."
austen#Their preparations , however , were stopped short . Alarming sounds were heard ; other visitors approached , and the door was thrown open for Sir Walter and Miss Elliot , whose entrance seemed to give a general chill . Anne felt an instant oppression , and wherever she looked saw symptoms of the same . The comfort , the freedom , the gaiety of the room was over , hushed into cold composure , determined silence , or insipid talk , to meet the heartless elegance of her father and sister . How mortifying to feel that it was so ! Her jealous eye was satisfied in one particular .
austen#"Captain Wentworth was acknowledged again by each , by Elizabeth more graciously than before . She even addressed him once , and looked at him more than once . Elizabeth was , in fact , revolving a great measure . The sequel explained it . After the waste of a few minutes in saying the proper nothings , she began to give the invitation which was to comprise all the remaining dues of the Musgroves . "" To - morrow evening , to meet a few friends : no formal party ."""
austen#"It was all said very gracefully , and the cards with which she had provided herself , the "" Miss Elliot at home ,"" were laid on the table , with a courteous , comprehensive smile to all , and one smile and one card more decidedly for Captain Wentworth . The truth was , that Elizabeth had been long enough in Bath to understand the importance of a man of such an air and appearance as his . The past was nothing . The present was that Captain Wentworth would move about well in her drawing - room . The card was pointedly given , and Sir Walter and Elizabeth arose and disappeared . The interruption had been short , though severe , and ease and animation returned to most of those they left as the door shut them out , but not to Anne ."
austen#"She could think only of the invitation she had with such astonishment witnessed , and of the manner in which it had been received ; a manner of doubtful meaning , of surprise rather than gratification , of polite acknowledgement rather than acceptance . She knew him ; she saw disdain in his eye , and could not venture to believe that he had determined to accept such an offering , as an atonement for all the insolence of the past . Her spirits sank . He held the card in his hand after they were gone , as if deeply considering it . "" Only think of Elizabeth ' s including everybody !"" whispered Mary very audibly ."
austen#""" I do not wonder Captain Wentworth is delighted ! You see he cannot put the card out of his hand ."" Anne caught his eye , saw his cheeks glow , and his mouth form itself into a momentary expression of contempt , and turned away , that she might neither see nor hear more to vex her . The party separated . The gentlemen had their own pursuits , the ladies proceeded on their own business , and they met no more while Anne belonged to them . She was earnestly begged to return and dine , and give them all the rest of the day , but her spirits had been so long exerted that at present she felt unequal to more , and fit only for home , where she might be sure of being as silent as she chose ."
austen#Promising to be with them the whole of the following morning , therefore , she closed the fatigues of the present by a toilsome walk to Camden Place , there to spend the evening chiefly in listening to the busy arrangements of Elizabeth and Mrs Clay for the morrow ' s party , the frequent enumeration of the persons invited , and the continually improving detail of all the embellishments which were to make it the most completely elegant of its kind in Bath , while harassing herself with the never - ending question , of whether Captain Wentworth would come or not ? They were reckoning him as certain , but with her it was a gnawing solicitude never appeased for five minutes together . She generally thought he would come , because she generally thought he ought ; but it was a case which she could not so shape into any positive act of duty or discretion , as inevitably to defy the suggestions of very opposite feelings . She only roused herself from the broodings of this restless agitation , to let Mrs Clay know that she had been seen with Mr Elliot three hours after his being supposed to be out of Bath , for having watched in vain for some intimation of the interview from the lady herself , she determined to mention it , and it seemed to her there was guilt in Mrs Clay ' s face as she listened . It was transient : cleared away in an instant ; but Anne could imagine she read there the consciousness of having , by some complication of mutual trick , or some overbearing authority of his , been obliged to attend ( perhaps for half an hour ) to his lectures and restrictions on her designs on Sir Walter . She exclaimed , however , with a very tolerable imitation of nature : --
austen#""" Oh ! dear ! very true . Only think , Miss Elliot , to my great surprise I met with Mr Elliot in Bath Street . I was never more astonished . He turned back and walked with me to the Pump Yard ."
austen#"He had been prevented setting off for Thornberry , but I really forget by what ; for I was in a hurry , and could not much attend , and I can only answer for his being determined not to be delayed in his return . He wanted to know how early he might be admitted to - morrow . He was full of ` to - morrow ,' and it is very evident that I have been full of it too , ever since I entered the house , and learnt the extension of your plan and all that had happened , or my seeing him could never have gone so entirely out of my head ."" Chapter 23 One day only had passed since Anne ' s conversation with Mrs Smith ; but a keener interest had succeeded , and she was now so little touched by Mr Elliot ' s conduct , except by its effects in one quarter , that it became a matter of course the next morning , still to defer her explanatory visit in Rivers Street . She had promised to be with the Musgroves from breakfast to dinner ."
austen#Her faith was plighted , and Mr Elliot ' s character , like the Sultaness Scheherazade ' s head , must live another day . She could not keep her appointment punctually , however ; the weather was unfavourable , and she had grieved over the rain on her friends ' account , and felt it very much on her own , before she was able to attempt the walk . When she reached the White Hart , and made her way to the proper apartment , she found herself neither arriving quite in time , nor the first to arrive . The party before her were , Mrs Musgrove , talking to Mrs Croft , and Captain Harville to Captain Wentworth ; and she immediately heard that Mary and Henrietta , too impatient to wait , had gone out the moment it had cleared , but would be back again soon , and that the strictest injunctions had been left with Mrs Musgrove to keep her there till they returned . She had only to submit , sit down , be outwardly composed , and feel herself plunged at once in all the agitations which she had merely laid her account of tasting a little before the morning closed . There was no delay , no waste of time .
austen#"She was deep in the happiness of such misery , or the misery of such happiness , instantly . Two minutes after her entering the room , Captain Wentworth said -- "" We will write the letter we were talking of , Harville , now , if you will give me materials ."" Materials were at hand , on a separate table ; he went to it , and nearly turning his back to them all , was engrossed by writing . Mrs Musgrove was giving Mrs Croft the history of her eldest daughter ' s engagement , and just in that inconvenient tone of voice which was perfectly audible while it pretended to be a whisper . Anne felt that she did not belong to the conversation , and yet , as Captain Harville seemed thoughtful and not disposed to talk , she could not avoid hearing many undesirable particulars ; such as , "" how Mr Musgrove and my brother Hayter had met again and again to talk it over ; what my brother Hayter had said one day , and what Mr Musgrove had proposed the next , and what had occurred to my sister Hayter , and what the young people had wished , and what I said at first I never could consent to , but was afterwards persuaded to think might do very well ,"" and a great deal in the same style of open - hearted communication : minutiae which , even with every advantage of taste and delicacy , which good Mrs Musgrove could not give , could be properly interesting only to the principals ."
austen#"Mrs Croft was attending with great good - humour , and whenever she spoke at all , it was very sensibly . Anne hoped the gentlemen might each be too much self - occupied to hear . "" And so , ma ' am , all these thing considered ,"" said Mrs Musgrove , in her powerful whisper , "" though we could have wished it different , yet , altogether , we did not think it fair to stand out any longer , for Charles Hayter was quite wild about it , and Henrietta was pretty near as bad ; and so we thought they had better marry at once , and make the best of it , as many others have done before them . At any rate , said I , it will be better than a long engagement ."" "" That is precisely what I was going to observe ,"" cried Mrs Croft . "" I would rather have young people settle on a small income at once , and have to struggle with a few difficulties together , than be involved in a long engagement ."
austen#"I always think that no mutual --"" "" Oh ! dear Mrs Croft ,"" cried Mrs Musgrove , unable to let her finish her speech , "" there is nothing I so abominate for young people as a long engagement . It is what I always protested against for my children . It is all very well , I used to say , for young people to be engaged , if there is a certainty of their being able to marry in six months , or even in twelve ; but a long engagement --"" "" Yes , dear ma ' am ,"" said Mrs Croft , "" or an uncertain engagement , an engagement which may be long ."
austen#"To begin without knowing that at such a time there will be the means of marrying , I hold to be very unsafe and unwise , and what I think all parents should prevent as far as they can ."" Anne found an unexpected interest here . She felt its application to herself , felt it in a nervous thrill all over her ; and at the same moment that her eyes instinctively glanced towards the distant table , Captain Wentworth ' s pen ceased to move , his head was raised , pausing , listening , and he turned round the next instant to give a look , one quick , conscious look at her . The two ladies continued to talk , to re - urge the same admitted truths , and enforce them with such examples of the ill effect of a contrary practice as had fallen within their observation , but Anne heard nothing distinctly ; it was only a buzz of words in her ear , her mind was in confusion . Captain Harville , who had in truth been hearing none of it , now left his seat , and moved to a window , and Anne seeming to watch him , though it was from thorough absence of mind , became gradually sensible that he was inviting her to join him where he stood . He looked at her with a smile , and a little motion of the head , which expressed , "" Come to me , I have something to say ;"" and the unaffected , easy kindness of manner which denoted the feelings of an older acquaintance than he really was , strongly enforced the invitation ."
austen#"She roused herself and went to him . The window at which he stood was at the other end of the room from where the two ladies were sitting , and though nearer to Captain Wentworth ' s table , not very near . As she joined him , Captain Harville ' s countenance re - assumed the serious , thoughtful expression which seemed its natural character . "" Look here ,"" said he , unfolding a parcel in his hand , and displaying a small miniature painting , "" do you know who that is ?"" "" Certainly : Captain Benwick ."" "" Yes , and you may guess who it is for ."
austen#"But ,"" ( in a deep tone ,) "" it was not done for her . Miss Elliot , do you remember our walking together at Lyme , and grieving for him ? I little thought then -- but no matter . This was drawn at the Cape . He met with a clever young German artist at the Cape , and in compliance with a promise to my poor sister , sat to him , and was bringing it home for her ; and I have now the charge of getting it properly set for another ! It was a commission to me !"
austen#"But who else was there to employ ? I hope I can allow for him . I am not sorry , indeed , to make it over to another . He undertakes it ;"" ( looking towards Captain Wentworth ,) "" he is writing about it now ."" And with a quivering lip he wound up the whole by adding , "" Poor Fanny ! she would not have forgotten him so soon !"""
austen#""" No ,"" replied Anne , in a low , feeling voice . "" That I can easily believe ."" "" It was not in her nature . She doted on him ."" "" It would not be the nature of any woman who truly loved ."" Captain Harville smiled , as much as to say , "" Do you claim that for your sex ?"""
austen#"and she answered the question , smiling also , "" Yes . We certainly do not forget you as soon as you forget us . It is , perhaps , our fate rather than our merit . We cannot help ourselves . We live at home , quiet , confined , and our feelings prey upon us . You are forced on exertion ."
austen#"You have always a profession , pursuits , business of some sort or other , to take you back into the world immediately , and continual occupation and change soon weaken impressions ."" "" Granting your assertion that the world does all this so soon for men ( which , however , I do not think I shall grant ), it does not apply to Benwick . He has not been forced upon any exertion . The peace turned him on shore at the very moment , and he has been living with us , in our little family circle , ever since ."" "" True ,"" said Anne , "" very true ; I did not recollect ; but what shall we say now , Captain Harville ? If the change be not from outward circumstances , it must be from within ; it must be nature , man ' s nature , which has done the business for Captain Benwick ."""
austen#""" No , no , it is not man ' s nature . I will not allow it to be more man ' s nature than woman ' s to be inconstant and forget those they do love , or have loved . I believe the reverse . I believe in a true analogy between our bodily frames and our mental ; and that as our bodies are the strongest , so are our feelings ; capable of bearing most rough usage , and riding out the heaviest weather ."" "" Your feelings may be the strongest ,"" replied Anne , "" but the same spirit of analogy will authorise me to assert that ours are the most tender . Man is more robust than woman , but he is not longer lived ; which exactly explains my view of the nature of their attachments ."
austen#"Nay , it would be too hard upon you , if it were otherwise . You have difficulties , and privations , and dangers enough to struggle with . You are always labouring and toiling , exposed to every risk and hardship . Your home , country , friends , all quitted . Neither time , nor health , nor life , to be called your own . It would be hard , indeed "" ( with a faltering voice ), "" if woman ' s feelings were to be added to all this ."""
austen#""" We shall never agree upon this question ,"" Captain Harville was beginning to say , when a slight noise called their attention to Captain Wentworth ' s hitherto perfectly quiet division of the room . It was nothing more than that his pen had fallen down ; but Anne was startled at finding him nearer than she had supposed , and half inclined to suspect that the pen had only fallen because he had been occupied by them , striving to catch sounds , which yet she did not think he could have caught . "" Have you finished your letter ?"" said Captain Harville . "" Not quite , a few lines more . I shall have done in five minutes ."""
austen#""" There is no hurry on my side . I am only ready whenever you are . I am in very good anchorage here ,"" ( smiling at Anne ,) "" well supplied , and want for nothing . No hurry for a signal at all . Well , Miss Elliot ,"" ( lowering his voice ,) "" as I was saying we shall never agree , I suppose , upon this point . No man and woman , would , probably ."
austen#"But let me observe that all histories are against you -- all stories , prose and verse . If I had such a memory as Benwick , I could bring you fifty quotations in a moment on my side the argument , and I do not think I ever opened a book in my life which had not something to say upon woman ' s inconstancy . Songs and proverbs , all talk of woman ' s fickleness . But perhaps you will say , these were all written by men ."" "" Perhaps I shall . Yes , yes , if you please , no reference to examples in books ."
austen#"Men have had every advantage of us in telling their own story . Education has been theirs in so much higher a degree ; the pen has been in their hands . I will not allow books to prove anything ."" "" But how shall we prove anything ?"" "" We never shall . We never can expect to prove any thing upon such a point ."
austen#"It is a difference of opinion which does not admit of proof . We each begin , probably , with a little bias towards our own sex ; and upon that bias build every circumstance in favour of it which has occurred within our own circle ; many of which circumstances ( perhaps those very cases which strike us the most ) may be precisely such as cannot be brought forward without betraying a confidence , or in some respect saying what should not be said ."" "" Ah !"" cried Captain Harville , in a tone of strong feeling , "" if I could but make you comprehend what a man suffers when he takes a last look at his wife and children , and watches the boat that he has sent them off in , as long as it is in sight , and then turns away and says , ` God knows whether we ever meet again !' And then , if I could convey to you the glow of his soul when he does see them again ; when , coming back after a twelvemonth ' s absence , perhaps , and obliged to put into another port , he calculates how soon it be possible to get them there , pretending to deceive himself , and saying , ` They cannot be here till such a day ,' but all the while hoping for them twelve hours sooner , and seeing them arrive at last , as if Heaven had given them wings , by many hours sooner still ! If I could explain to you all this , and all that a man can bear and do , and glories to do , for the sake of these treasures of his existence !"
austen#"I speak , you know , only of such men as have hearts !"" pressing his own with emotion . "" Oh !"" cried Anne eagerly , "" I hope I do justice to all that is felt by you , and by those who resemble you . God forbid that I should undervalue the warm and faithful feelings of any of my fellow - creatures ! I should deserve utter contempt if I dared to suppose that true attachment and constancy were known only by woman ."
austen#"No , I believe you capable of everything great and good in your married lives . I believe you equal to every important exertion , and to every domestic forbearance , so long as -- if I may be allowed the expression -- so long as you have an object . I mean while the woman you love lives , and lives for you . All the privilege I claim for my own sex ( it is not a very enviable one ; you need not covet it ), is that of loving longest , when existence or when hope is gone ."" She could not immediately have uttered another sentence ; her heart was too full , her breath too much oppressed . "" You are a good soul ,"" cried Captain Harville , putting his hand on her arm , quite affectionately ."
austen#""" There is no quarrelling with you . And when I think of Benwick , my tongue is tied ."" Their attention was called towards the others . Mrs Croft was taking leave . "" Here , Frederick , you and I part company , I believe ,"" said she . "" I am going home , and you have an engagement with your friend ."
austen#"To - night we may have the pleasure of all meeting again at your party ,"" ( turning to Anne .) "" We had your sister ' s card yesterday , and I understood Frederick had a card too , though I did not see it ; and you are disengaged , Frederick , are you not , as well as ourselves ?"" Captain Wentworth was folding up a letter in great haste , and either could not or would not answer fully . "" Yes ,"" said he , "" very true ; here we separate , but Harville and I shall soon be after you ; that is , Harville , if you are ready , I am in half a minute . I know you will not be sorry to be off . I shall be at your service in half a minute ."""
austen#"Mrs Croft left them , and Captain Wentworth , having sealed his letter with great rapidity , was indeed ready , and had even a hurried , agitated air , which shewed impatience to be gone . Anne knew not how to understand it . She had the kindest "" Good morning , God bless you !"" from Captain Harville , but from him not a word , nor a look ! He had passed out of the room without a look ! She had only time , however , to move closer to the table where he had been writing , when footsteps were heard returning ; the door opened , it was himself ."
austen#"He begged their pardon , but he had forgotten his gloves , and instantly crossing the room to the writing table , he drew out a letter from under the scattered paper , placed it before Anne with eyes of glowing entreaty fixed on her for a time , and hastily collecting his gloves , was again out of the room , almost before Mrs Musgrove was aware of his being in it : the work of an instant ! The revolution which one instant had made in Anne , was almost beyond expression . The letter , with a direction hardly legible , to "" Miss A . E .--,"" was evidently the one which he had been folding so hastily . While supposed to be writing only to Captain Benwick , he had been also addressing her ! On the contents of that letter depended all which this world could do for her . Anything was possible , anything might be defied rather than suspense ."
austen#"Mrs Musgrove had little arrangements of her own at her own table ; to their protection she must trust , and sinking into the chair which he had occupied , succeeding to the very spot where he had leaned and written , her eyes devoured the following words : "" I can listen no longer in silence . I must speak to you by such means as are within my reach . You pierce my soul . I am half agony , half hope . Tell me not that I am too late , that such precious feelings are gone for ever ."
austen#I offer myself to you again with a heart even more your own than when you almost broke it , eight years and a half ago . Dare not say that man forgets sooner than woman , that his love has an earlier death . I have loved none but you . Unjust I may have been , weak and resentful I have been , but never inconstant . You alone have brought me to Bath . For you alone , I think and plan .
austen#Have you not seen this ? Can you fail to have understood my wishes ? I had not waited even these ten days , could I have read your feelings , as I think you must have penetrated mine . I can hardly write . I am every instant hearing something which overpowers me . You sink your voice , but I can distinguish the tones of that voice when they would be lost on others .
austen#"Too good , too excellent creature ! You do us justice , indeed . You do believe that there is true attachment and constancy among men . Believe it to be most fervent , most undeviating , in F . W . "" I must go , uncertain of my fate ; but I shall return hither , or follow your party , as soon as possible . A word , a look , will be enough to decide whether I enter your father ' s house this evening or never ."""
austen#Such a letter was not to be soon recovered from . Half and hour ' s solitude and reflection might have tranquillized her ; but the ten minutes only which now passed before she was interrupted , with all the restraints of her situation , could do nothing towards tranquillity . Every moment rather brought fresh agitation . It was overpowering happiness . And before she was beyond the first stage of full sensation , Charles , Mary , and Henrietta all came in . The absolute necessity of seeming like herself produced then an immediate struggle ; but after a while she could do no more .
austen#"She began not to understand a word they said , and was obliged to plead indisposition and excuse herself . They could then see that she looked very ill , were shocked and concerned , and would not stir without her for the world . This was dreadful . Would they only have gone away , and left her in the quiet possession of that room it would have been her cure ; but to have them all standing or waiting around her was distracting , and in desperation , she said she would go home . "" By all means , my dear ,"" cried Mrs Musgrove , "" go home directly , and take care of yourself , that you may be fit for the evening . I wish Sarah was here to doctor you , but I am no doctor myself ."
austen#"Charles , ring and order a chair . She must not walk ."" But the chair would never do . Worse than all ! To lose the possibility of speaking two words to Captain Wentworth in the course of her quiet , solitary progress up the town ( and she felt almost certain of meeting him ) could not be borne . The chair was earnestly protested against , and Mrs Musgrove , who thought only of one sort of illness , having assured herself with some anxiety , that there had been no fall in the case ; that Anne had not at any time lately slipped down , and got a blow on her head ; that she was perfectly convinced of having had no fall ; could part with her cheerfully , and depend on finding her better at night ."
austen#"Anxious to omit no possible precaution , Anne struggled , and said -- "" I am afraid , ma ' am , that it is not perfectly understood . Pray be so good as to mention to the other gentlemen that we hope to see your whole party this evening . I am afraid there had been some mistake ; and I wish you particularly to assure Captain Harville and Captain Wentworth , that we hope to see them both ."" "" Oh ! my dear , it is quite understood , I give you my word ."
austen#"Captain Harville has no thought but of going ."" "" Do you think so ? But I am afraid ; and I should be so very sorry . Will you promise me to mention it , when you see them again ? You will see them both this morning , I dare say . Do promise me ."""
austen#""" To be sure I will , if you wish it . Charles , if you see Captain Harville anywhere , remember to give Miss Anne ' s message . But indeed , my dear , you need not be uneasy . Captain Harville holds himself quite engaged , I ' ll answer for it ; and Captain Wentworth the same , I dare say ."" Anne could do no more ; but her heart prophesied some mischance to damp the perfection of her felicity . It could not be very lasting , however ."
austen#Even if he did not come to Camden Place himself , it would be in her power to send an intelligible sentence by Captain Harville . Another momentary vexation occurred . Charles , in his real concern and good nature , would go home with her ; there was no preventing him . This was almost cruel . But she could not be long ungrateful ; he was sacrificing an engagement at a gunsmith ' s , to be of use to her ; and she set off with him , with no feeling but gratitude apparent . They were on Union Street , when a quicker step behind , a something of familiar sound , gave her two moments ' preparation for the sight of Captain Wentworth .
austen#"He joined them ; but , as if irresolute whether to join or to pass on , said nothing , only looked . Anne could command herself enough to receive that look , and not repulsively . The cheeks which had been pale now glowed , and the movements which had hesitated were decided . He walked by her side . Presently , struck by a sudden thought , Charles said -- "" Captain Wentworth , which way are you going ?"
austen#"Only to Gay Street , or farther up the town ?"" "" I hardly know ,"" replied Captain Wentworth , surprised . "" Are you going as high as Belmont ? Are you going near Camden Place ? Because , if you are , I shall have no scruple in asking you to take my place , and give Anne your arm to her father ' s door . She is rather done for this morning , and must not go so far without help , and I ought to be at that fellow ' s in the Market Place ."
austen#"He promised me the sight of a capital gun he is just going to send off ; said he would keep it unpacked to the last possible moment , that I might see it ; and if I do not turn back now , I have no chance . By his description , a good deal like the second size double - barrel of mine , which you shot with one day round Winthrop ."" There could not be an objection . There could be only the most proper alacrity , a most obliging compliance for public view ; and smiles reined in and spirits dancing in private rapture . In half a minute Charles was at the bottom of Union Street again , and the other two proceeding together : and soon words enough had passed between them to decide their direction towards the comparatively quiet and retired gravel walk , where the power of conversation would make the present hour a blessing indeed , and prepare it for all the immortality which the happiest recollections of their own future lives could bestow . There they exchanged again those feelings and those promises which had once before seemed to secure everything , but which had been followed by so many , many years of division and estrangement ."
austen#There they returned again into the past , more exquisitely happy , perhaps , in their re - union , than when it had been first projected ; more tender , more tried , more fixed in a knowledge of each other ' s character , truth , and attachment ; more equal to act , more justified in acting . And there , as they slowly paced the gradual ascent , heedless of every group around them , seeing neither sauntering politicians , bustling housekeepers , flirting girls , nor nursery - maids and children , they could indulge in those retrospections and acknowledgements , and especially in those explanations of what had directly preceded the present moment , which were so poignant and so ceaseless in interest . All the little variations of the last week were gone through ; and of yesterday and today there could scarcely be an end . She had not mistaken him . Jealousy of Mr Elliot had been the retarding weight , the doubt , the torment . That had begun to operate in the very hour of first meeting her in Bath ; that had returned , after a short suspension , to ruin the concert ; and that had influenced him in everything he had said and done , or omitted to say and do , in the last four - and - twenty hours .
austen#It had been gradually yielding to the better hopes which her looks , or words , or actions occasionally encouraged ; it had been vanquished at last by those sentiments and those tones which had reached him while she talked with Captain Harville ; and under the irresistible governance of which he had seized a sheet of paper , and poured out his feelings . Of what he had then written , nothing was to be retracted or qualified . He persisted in having loved none but her . She had never been supplanted . He never even believed himself to see her equal . Thus much indeed he was obliged to acknowledge : that he had been constant unconsciously , nay unintentionally ; that he had meant to forget her , and believed it to be done .
austen#He had imagined himself indifferent , when he had only been angry ; and he had been unjust to her merits , because he had been a sufferer from them . Her character was now fixed on his mind as perfection itself , maintaining the loveliest medium of fortitude and gentleness ; but he was obliged to acknowledge that only at Uppercross had he learnt to do her justice , and only at Lyme had he begun to understand himself . At Lyme , he had received lessons of more than one sort . The passing admiration of Mr Elliot had at least roused him , and the scenes on the Cobb and at Captain Harville ' s had fixed her superiority . In his preceding attempts to attach himself to Louisa Musgrove ( the attempts of angry pride ), he protested that he had for ever felt it to be impossible ; that he had not cared , could not care , for Louisa ; though till that day , till the leisure for reflection which followed it , he had not understood the perfect excellence of the mind with which Louisa ' s could so ill bear a comparison , or the perfect unrivalled hold it possessed over his own . There , he had learnt to distinguish between the steadiness of principle and the obstinacy of self - will , between the darings of heedlessness and the resolution of a collected mind .
austen#"There he had seen everything to exalt in his estimation the woman he had lost ; and there begun to deplore the pride , the folly , the madness of resentment , which had kept him from trying to regain her when thrown in his way . From that period his penance had become severe . He had no sooner been free from the horror and remorse attending the first few days of Louisa ' s accident , no sooner begun to feel himself alive again , than he had begun to feel himself , though alive , not at liberty . "" I found ,"" said he , "" that I was considered by Harville an engaged man ! That neither Harville nor his wife entertained a doubt of our mutual attachment . I was startled and shocked ."
austen#"To a degree , I could contradict this instantly ; but , when I began to reflect that others might have felt the same -- her own family , nay , perhaps herself -- I was no longer at my own disposal . I was hers in honour if she wished it . I had been unguarded . I had not thought seriously on this subject before . I had not considered that my excessive intimacy must have its danger of ill consequence in many ways ; and that I had no right to be trying whether I could attach myself to either of the girls , at the risk of raising even an unpleasant report , were there no other ill effects . I had been grossly wrong , and must abide the consequences ."""
austen#"He found too late , in short , that he had entangled himself ; and that precisely as he became fully satisfied of his not caring for Louisa at all , he must regard himself as bound to her , if her sentiments for him were what the Harvilles supposed . It determined him to leave Lyme , and await her complete recovery elsewhere . He would gladly weaken , by any fair means , whatever feelings or speculations concerning him might exist ; and he went , therefore , to his brother ' s , meaning after a while to return to Kellynch , and act as circumstances might require . "" I was six weeks with Edward ,"" said he , "" and saw him happy . I could have no other pleasure . I deserved none ."
austen#"He enquired after you very particularly ; asked even if you were personally altered , little suspecting that to my eye you could never alter ."" Anne smiled , and let it pass . It was too pleasing a blunder for a reproach . It is something for a woman to be assured , in her eight - and - twentieth year , that she has not lost one charm of earlier youth ; but the value of such homage was inexpressibly increased to Anne , by comparing it with former words , and feeling it to be the result , not the cause of a revival of his warm attachment . He had remained in Shropshire , lamenting the blindness of his own pride , and the blunders of his own calculations , till at once released from Louisa by the astonishing and felicitous intelligence of her engagement with Benwick . "" Here ,"" said he , "" ended the worst of my state ; for now I could at least put myself in the way of happiness ; I could exert myself ; I could do something ."
austen#But to be waiting so long in inaction , and waiting only for evil , had been dreadful . Within the first five minutes I said , ` I will be at Bath on Wednesday ,' and I was . Was it unpardonable to think it worth my while to come ? and to arrive with some degree of hope ? You were single . It was possible that you might retain the feelings of the past , as I did ; and one encouragement happened to be mine .
austen#"I could never doubt that you would be loved and sought by others , but I knew to a certainty that you had refused one man , at least , of better pretensions than myself ; and I could not help often saying , ` Was this for me ?'"" Their first meeting in Milsom Street afforded much to be said , but the concert still more . That evening seemed to be made up of exquisite moments . The moment of her stepping forward in the Octagon Room to speak to him : the moment of Mr Elliot ' s appearing and tearing her away , and one or two subsequent moments , marked by returning hope or increasing despondency , were dwelt on with energy . "" To see you ,"" cried he , "" in the midst of those who could not be my well - wishers ; to see your cousin close by you , conversing and smiling , and feel all the horrible eligibilities and proprieties of the match ! To consider it as the certain wish of every being who could hope to influence you !"
austen#"Even if your own feelings were reluctant or indifferent , to consider what powerful supports would be his ! Was it not enough to make the fool of me which I appeared ? How could I look on without agony ? Was not the very sight of the friend who sat behind you , was not the recollection of what had been , the knowledge of her influence , the indelible , immoveable impression of what persuasion had once done -- was it not all against me ?"" "" You should have distinguished ,"" replied Anne . "" You should not have suspected me now ; the case is so different , and my age is so different ."
austen#"If I was wrong in yielding to persuasion once , remember that it was to persuasion exerted on the side of safety , not of risk . When I yielded , I thought it was to duty , but no duty could be called in aid here . In marrying a man indifferent to me , all risk would have been incurred , and all duty violated ."" "" Perhaps I ought to have reasoned thus ,"" he replied , "" but I could not . I could not derive benefit from the late knowledge I had acquired of your character . I could not bring it into play ; it was overwhelmed , buried , lost in those earlier feelings which I had been smarting under year after year ."
austen#"I could think of you only as one who had yielded , who had given me up , who had been influenced by any one rather than by me . I saw you with the very person who had guided you in that year of misery . I had no reason to believe her of less authority now . The force of habit was to be added ."" "" I should have thought ,"" said Anne , "" that my manner to yourself might have spared you much or all of this ."" "" No , no !"
austen#"your manner might be only the ease which your engagement to another man would give . I left you in this belief ; and yet , I was determined to see you again . My spirits rallied with the morning , and I felt that I had still a motive for remaining here ."" At last Anne was at home again , and happier than any one in that house could have conceived . All the surprise and suspense , and every other painful part of the morning dissipated by this conversation , she re - entered the house so happy as to be obliged to find an alloy in some momentary apprehensions of its being impossible to last . An interval of meditation , serious and grateful , was the best corrective of everything dangerous in such high - wrought felicity ; and she went to her room , and grew steadfast and fearless in the thankfulness of her enjoyment ."
austen#The evening came , the drawing - rooms were lighted up , the company assembled . It was but a card party , it was but a mixture of those who had never met before , and those who met too often ; a commonplace business , too numerous for intimacy , too small for variety ; but Anne had never found an evening shorter . Glowing and lovely in sensibility and happiness , and more generally admired than she thought about or cared for , she had cheerful or forbearing feelings for every creature around her . Mr Elliot was there ; she avoided , but she could pity him . The Wallises , she had amusement in understanding them . Lady Dalrymple and Miss Carteret -- they would soon be innoxious cousins to her .
austen#"She cared not for Mrs Clay , and had nothing to blush for in the public manners of her father and sister . With the Musgroves , there was the happy chat of perfect ease ; with Captain Harville , the kind - hearted intercourse of brother and sister ; with Lady Russell , attempts at conversation , which a delicious consciousness cut short ; with Admiral and Mrs Croft , everything of peculiar cordiality and fervent interest , which the same consciousness sought to conceal ; and with Captain Wentworth , some moments of communications continually occurring , and always the hope of more , and always the knowledge of his being there . It was in one of these short meetings , each apparently occupied in admiring a fine display of greenhouse plants , that she said -- "" I have been thinking over the past , and trying impartially to judge of the right and wrong , I mean with regard to myself ; and I must believe that I was right , much as I suffered from it , that I was perfectly right in being guided by the friend whom you will love better than you do now . To me , she was in the place of a parent . Do not mistake me , however ."
austen#"I am not saying that she did not err in her advice . It was , perhaps , one of those cases in which advice is good or bad only as the event decides ; and for myself , I certainly never should , in any circumstance of tolerable similarity , give such advice . But I mean , that I was right in submitting to her , and that if I had done otherwise , I should have suffered more in continuing the engagement than I did even in giving it up , because I should have suffered in my conscience . I have now , as far as such a sentiment is allowable in human nature , nothing to reproach myself with ; and if I mistake not , a strong sense of duty is no bad part of a woman ' s portion ."" He looked at her , looked at Lady Russell , and looking again at her , replied , as if in cool deliberation -- "" Not yet ."
austen#"But there are hopes of her being forgiven in time . I trust to being in charity with her soon . But I too have been thinking over the past , and a question has suggested itself , whether there may not have been one person more my enemy even than that lady ? My own self . Tell me if , when I returned to England in the year eight , with a few thousand pounds , and was posted into the Laconia , if I had then written to you , would you have answered my letter ? Would you , in short , have renewed the engagement then ?"""
austen#""" Would I !"" was all her answer ; but the accent was decisive enough . "" Good God !"" he cried , "" you would ! It is not that I did not think of it , or desire it , as what could alone crown all my other success ; but I was proud , too proud to ask again . I did not understand you ."
austen#I shut my eyes , and would not understand you , or do you justice . This is a recollection which ought to make me forgive every one sooner than myself . Six years of separation and suffering might have been spared . It is a sort of pain , too , which is new to me . I have been used to the gratification of believing myself to earn every blessing that I enjoyed . I have valued myself on honourable toils and just rewards .
austen#"Like other great men under reverses ,"" he added , with a smile . "" I must endeavour to subdue my mind to my fortune . I must learn to brook being happier than I deserve ."" Chapter 24 Who can be in doubt of what followed ? When any two young people take it into their heads to marry , they are pretty sure by perseverance to carry their point , be they ever so poor , or ever so imprudent , or ever so little likely to be necessary to each other ' s ultimate comfort ."
austen#This may be bad morality to conclude with , but I believe it to be truth ; and if such parties succeed , how should a Captain Wentworth and an Anne Elliot , with the advantage of maturity of mind , consciousness of right , and one independent fortune between them , fail of bearing down every opposition ? They might in fact , have borne down a great deal more than they met with , for there was little to distress them beyond the want of graciousness and warmth . Sir Walter made no objection , and Elizabeth did nothing worse than look cold and unconcerned . Captain Wentworth , with five - and - twenty thousand pounds , and as high in his profession as merit and activity could place him , was no longer nobody . He was now esteemed quite worthy to address the daughter of a foolish , spendthrift baronet , who had not had principle or sense enough to maintain himself in the situation in which Providence had placed him , and who could give his daughter at present but a small part of the share of ten thousand pounds which must be hers hereafter . Sir Walter , indeed , though he had no affection for Anne , and no vanity flattered , to make him really happy on the occasion , was very far from thinking it a bad match for her .
austen#On the contrary , when he saw more of Captain Wentworth , saw him repeatedly by daylight , and eyed him well , he was very much struck by his personal claims , and felt that his superiority of appearance might be not unfairly balanced against her superiority of rank ; and all this , assisted by his well - sounding name , enabled Sir Walter at last to prepare his pen , with a very good grace , for the insertion of the marriage in the volume of honour . The only one among them , whose opposition of feeling could excite any serious anxiety was Lady Russell . Anne knew that Lady Russell must be suffering some pain in understanding and relinquishing Mr Elliot , and be making some struggles to become truly acquainted with , and do justice to Captain Wentworth . This however was what Lady Russell had now to do . She must learn to feel that she had been mistaken with regard to both ; that she had been unfairly influenced by appearances in each ; that because Captain Wentworth ' s manners had not suited her own ideas , she had been too quick in suspecting them to indicate a character of dangerous impetuosity ; and that because Mr Elliot ' s manners had precisely pleased her in their propriety and correctness , their general politeness and suavity , she had been too quick in receiving them as the certain result of the most correct opinions and well - regulated mind . There was nothing less for Lady Russell to do , than to admit that she had been pretty completely wrong , and to take up a new set of opinions and of hopes .
austen#There is a quickness of perception in some , a nicety in the discernment of character , a natural penetration , in short , which no experience in others can equal , and Lady Russell had been less gifted in this part of understanding than her young friend . But she was a very good woman , and if her second object was to be sensible and well - judging , her first was to see Anne happy . She loved Anne better than she loved her own abilities ; and when the awkwardness of the beginning was over , found little hardship in attaching herself as a mother to the man who was securing the happiness of her other child . Of all the family , Mary was probably the one most immediately gratified by the circumstance . It was creditable to have a sister married , and she might flatter herself with having been greatly instrumental to the connexion , by keeping Anne with her in the autumn ; and as her own sister must be better than her husband ' s sisters , it was very agreeable that Captain Wentworth should be a richer man than either Captain Benwick or Charles Hayter . She had something to suffer , perhaps , when they came into contact again , in seeing Anne restored to the rights of seniority , and the mistress of a very pretty landaulette ; but she had a future to look forward to , of powerful consolation .
austen#Anne had no Uppercross Hall before her , no landed estate , no headship of a family ; and if they could but keep Captain Wentworth from being made a baronet , she would not change situations with Anne . It would be well for the eldest sister if she were equally satisfied with her situation , for a change is not very probable there . She had soon the mortification of seeing Mr Elliot withdraw , and no one of proper condition has since presented himself to raise even the unfounded hopes which sunk with him . The news of his cousins Anne ' s engagement burst on Mr Elliot most unexpectedly . It deranged his best plan of domestic happiness , his best hope of keeping Sir Walter single by the watchfulness which a son - in - law ' s rights would have given . But , though discomfited and disappointed , he could still do something for his own interest and his own enjoyment .
austen#He soon quitted Bath ; and on Mrs Clay ' s quitting it soon afterwards , and being next heard of as established under his protection in London , it was evident how double a game he had been playing , and how determined he was to save himself from being cut out by one artful woman , at least . Mrs Clay ' s affections had overpowered her interest , and she had sacrificed , for the young man ' s sake , the possibility of scheming longer for Sir Walter . She has abilities , however , as well as affections ; and it is now a doubtful point whether his cunning , or hers , may finally carry the day ; whether , after preventing her from being the wife of Sir Walter , he may not be wheedled and caressed at last into making her the wife of Sir William . It cannot be doubted that Sir Walter and Elizabeth were shocked and mortified by the loss of their companion , and the discovery of their deception in her . They had their great cousins , to be sure , to resort to for comfort ; but they must long feel that to flatter and follow others , without being flattered and followed in turn , is but a state of half enjoyment . Anne , satisfied at a very early period of Lady Russell ' s meaning to love Captain Wentworth as she ought , had no other alloy to the happiness of her prospects than what arose from the consciousness of having no relations to bestow on him which a man of sense could value .
austen#There she felt her own inferiority very keenly . The disproportion in their fortune was nothing ; it did not give her a moment ' s regret ; but to have no family to receive and estimate him properly , nothing of respectability , of harmony , of good will to offer in return for all the worth and all the prompt welcome which met her in his brothers and sisters , was a source of as lively pain as her mind could well be sensible of under circumstances of otherwise strong felicity . She had but two friends in the world to add to his list , Lady Russell and Mrs Smith . To those , however , he was very well disposed to attach himself . Lady Russell , in spite of all her former transgressions , he could now value from his heart . While he was not obliged to say that he believed her to have been right in originally dividing them , he was ready to say almost everything else in her favour , and as for Mrs Smith , she had claims of various kinds to recommend her quickly and permanently .
austen#Her recent good offices by Anne had been enough in themselves , and their marriage , instead of depriving her of one friend , secured her two . She was their earliest visitor in their settled life ; and Captain Wentworth , by putting her in the way of recovering her husband ' s property in the West Indies , by writing for her , acting for her , and seeing her through all the petty difficulties of the case with the activity and exertion of a fearless man and a determined friend , fully requited the services which she had rendered , or ever meant to render , to his wife . Mrs Smith ' s enjoyments were not spoiled by this improvement of income , with some improvement of health , and the acquisition of such friends to be often with , for her cheerfulness and mental alacrity did not fail her ; and while these prime supplies of good remained , she might have bid defiance even to greater accessions of worldly prosperity . She might have been absolutely rich and perfectly healthy , and yet be happy . Her spring of felicity was in the glow of her spirits , as her friend Anne ' s was in the warmth of her heart . Anne was tenderness itself , and she had the full worth of it in Captain Wentworth ' s affection .
austen#His profession was all that could ever make her friends wish that tenderness less , the dread of a future war all that could dim her sunshine . She gloried in being a sailor ' s wife , but she must pay the tax of quick alarm for belonging to that profession which is , if possible , more distinguished in its domestic virtues than in its national importance . Finis
austen#"I do not care if it IS the Doctor ' s favourite colour . I am sure , for my part , I should never have known he DID like it better than any other colour , if he had not happened to say so . My cousins have been so plaguing me ! I declare sometimes I do not know which way to look before them ."" She had wandered away to a subject on which Elinor had nothing to say , and therefore soon judged it expedient to find her way back again to the first . "" Well , but Miss Dashwood ,"" speaking triumphantly , "" people may say what they chuse about Mr . Ferrars ' s declaring he would not have Lucy , for it is no such thing I can tell you ; and it is quite a shame for such ill - natured reports to be spread abroad ."
austen#"Whatever Lucy might think about it herself , you know , it was no business of other people to set it down for certain ."" "" I never heard any thing of the kind hinted at before , I assure you ,"" said Elinor . "" Oh , did not you ? But it WAS said , I know , very well , and by more than one ; for Miss Godby told Miss Sparks , that nobody in their senses could expect Mr . Ferrars to give up a woman like Miss Morton , with thirty thousand pounds to her fortune , for Lucy Steele that had nothing at all ; and I had it from Miss Sparks myself . And besides that , my cousin Richard said himself , that when it came to the point he was afraid Mr . Ferrars would be off ; and when Edward did not come near us for three days , I could not tell what to think myself ; and I believe in my heart Lucy gave it up all for lost ; for we came away from your brother ' s Wednesday , and we saw nothing of him not all Thursday , Friday , and Saturday , and did not know what was become of him . Once Lucy thought to write to him , but then her spirits rose against that ."
austen#However this morning he came just as we came home from church ; and then it all came out , how he had been sent for Wednesday to Harley Street , and been talked to by his mother and all of them , and how he had declared before them all that he loved nobody but Lucy , and nobody but Lucy would he have . And how he had been so worried by what passed , that as soon as he had went away from his mother ' s house , he had got upon his horse , and rid into the country , some where or other ; and how he had stayed about at an inn all Thursday and Friday , on purpose to get the better of it . And after thinking it all over and over again , he said , it seemed to him as if , now he had no fortune , and no nothing at all , it would be quite unkind to keep her on to the engagement , because it must be for her loss , for he had nothing but two thousand pounds , and no hope of any thing else ; and if he was to go into orders , as he had some thoughts , he could get nothing but a curacy , and how was they to live upon that ?-- He could not bear to think of her doing no better , and so he begged , if she had the least mind for it , to put an end to the matter directly , and leave him shift for himself . I heard him say all this as plain as could possibly be . And it was entirely for HER sake , and upon HER account , that he said a word about being off , and not upon his own . I will take my oath he never dropt a syllable of being tired of her , or of wishing to marry Miss Morton , or any thing like it .
austen#"But , to be sure , Lucy would not give ear to such kind of talking ; so she told him directly ( with a great deal about sweet and love , you know , and all that -- Oh , la ! one can ' t repeat such kind of things you know )-- she told him directly , she had not the least mind in the world to be off , for she could live with him upon a trifle , and how little so ever he might have , she should be very glad to have it all , you know , or something of the kind . So then he was monstrous happy , and talked on some time about what they should do , and they agreed he should take orders directly , and they must wait to be married till he got a living . And just then I could not hear any more , for my cousin called from below to tell me Mrs . Richardson was come in her coach , and would take one of us to Kensington Gardens ; so I was forced to go into the room and interrupt them , to ask Lucy if she would like to go , but she did not care to leave Edward ; so I just run up stairs and put on a pair of silk stockings and came off with the Richardsons ."" "" I do not understand what you mean by interrupting them ,"" said Elinor ; "" you were all in the same room together , were not you ?"" "" No , indeed , not us ."
austen#"La ! Miss Dashwood , do you think people make love when any body else is by ? Oh , for shame !-- To be sure you must know better than that . ( Laughing affectedly .) -- No , no ; they were shut up in the drawing - room together , and all I heard was only by listening at the door ."" "" How !"""
austen#"cried Elinor ; "" have you been repeating to me what you only learnt yourself by listening at the door ? I am sorry I did not know it before ; for I certainly would not have suffered you to give me particulars of a conversation which you ought not to have known yourself . How could you behave so unfairly by your sister ?"" "" Oh , la ! there is nothing in THAT . I only stood at the door , and heard what I could ."
austen#"And I am sure Lucy would have done just the same by me ; for a year or two back , when Martha Sharpe and I had so many secrets together , she never made any bones of hiding in a closet , or behind a chimney - board , on purpose to hear what we said ."" Elinor tried to talk of something else ; but Miss Steele could not be kept beyond a couple of minutes , from what was uppermost in her mind . "" Edward talks of going to Oxford soon ,"" said she ; "" but now he is lodging at No . --, Pall Mall . What an ill - natured woman his mother is , an ' t she ? And your brother and sister were not very kind !"
austen#However , I shan ' t say anything against them to YOU ; and to be sure they did send us home in their own chariot , which was more than I looked for . And for my part , I was all in a fright for fear your sister should ask us for the huswifes she had gave us a day or two before ; but , however , nothing was said about them , and I took care to keep mine out of sight . Edward have got some business at Oxford , he says ; so he must go there for a time ; and after THAT , as soon as he can light upon a Bishop , he will be ordained . I wonder what curacy he will get !-- Good gracious ! ( giggling as she spoke ) I ' d lay my life I know what my cousins will say , when they hear of it . They will tell me I should write to the Doctor , to get Edward the curacy of his new living .
austen#"I know they will ; but I am sure I would not do such a thing for all the world .-- ' La !' I shall say directly , ' I wonder how you could think of such a thing ? I write to the Doctor , indeed !'"" "" Well ,"" said Elinor , "" it is a comfort to be prepared against the worst . You have got your answer ready ."" Miss Steele was going to reply on the same subject , but the approach of her own party made another more necessary ."
austen#""" Oh , la ! here come the Richardsons . I had a vast deal more to say to you , but I must not stay away from them not any longer . I assure you they are very genteel people . He makes a monstrous deal of money , and they keep their own coach . I have not time to speak to Mrs . Jennings about it myself , but pray tell her I am quite happy to hear she is not in anger against us , and Lady Middleton the same ; and if anything should happen to take you and your sister away , and Mrs . Jennings should want company , I am sure we should be very glad to come and stay with her for as long a time as she likes ."
austen#"I suppose Lady Middleton won ' t ask us any more this bout . Good - by ; I am sorry Miss Marianne was not here . Remember me kindly to her . La ! if you have not got your spotted muslin on !-- I wonder you was not afraid of its being torn ."" Such was her parting concern ; for after this , she had time only to pay her farewell compliments to Mrs . Jennings , before her company was claimed by Mrs . Richardson ; and Elinor was left in possession of knowledge which might feed her powers of reflection some time , though she had learnt very little more than what had been already foreseen and foreplanned in her own mind ."
austen#"Edward ' s marriage with Lucy was as firmly determined on , and the time of its taking place remained as absolutely uncertain , as she had concluded it would be ;-- every thing depended , exactly after her expectation , on his getting that preferment , of which , at present , there seemed not the smallest chance . As soon as they returned to the carriage , Mrs . Jennings was eager for information ; but as Elinor wished to spread as little as possible intelligence that had in the first place been so unfairly obtained , she confined herself to the brief repetition of such simple particulars , as she felt assured that Lucy , for the sake of her own consequence , would choose to have known . The continuance of their engagement , and the means that were able to be taken for promoting its end , was all her communication ; and this produced from Mrs . Jennings the following natural remark . "" Wait for his having a living !-- ay , we all know how THAT will end :-- they will wait a twelvemonth , and finding no good comes of it , will set down upon a curacy of fifty pounds a - year , with the interest of his two thousand pounds , and what little matter Mr . Steele and Mr . Pratt can give her .-- Then they will have a child every year ! and Lord help ' em ! how poor they will be !-- I must see what I can give them towards furnishing their house ."
austen#"Two maids and two men , indeed !-- as I talked of t ' other day .-- No , no , they must get a stout girl of all works .-- Betty ' s sister would never do for them NOW ."" The next morning brought Elinor a letter by the two - penny post from Lucy herself . It was as follows : "" Bartlett ' s Building , March . "" I hope my dear Miss Dashwood will excuse the liberty I take of writing to her ; but I know your friendship for me will make you pleased to hear such a good account of myself and my dear Edward , after all the troubles we have went through lately , therefore will make no more apologies , but proceed to say that , thank God ! though we have suffered dreadfully , we are both quite well now , and as happy as we must always be in one another ' s love ."
austen#"We have had great trials , and great persecutions , but however , at the same time , gratefully acknowledge many friends , yourself not the least among them , whose great kindness I shall always thankfully remember , as will Edward too , who I have told of it . I am sure you will be glad to hear , as likewise dear Mrs . Jennings , I spent two happy hours with him yesterday afternoon , he would not hear of our parting , though earnestly did I , as I thought my duty required , urge him to it for prudence sake , and would have parted for ever on the spot , would he consent to it ; but he said it should never be , he did not regard his mother ' s anger , while he could have my affections ; our prospects are not very bright , to be sure , but we must wait , and hope for the best ; he will be ordained shortly ; and should it ever be in your power to recommend him to any body that has a living to bestow , am very sure you will not forget us , and dear Mrs . Jennings too , trust she will speak a good word for us to Sir John , or Mr . Palmer , or any friend that may be able to assist us .-- Poor Anne was much to blame for what she did , but she did it for the best , so I say nothing ; hope Mrs . Jennings won ' t think it too much trouble to give us a call , should she come this way any morning , ' twould be a great kindness , and my cousins would be proud to know her .-- My paper reminds me to conclude ; and begging to be most gratefully and respectfully remembered to her , and to Sir John , and Lady Middleton , and the dear children , when you chance to see them , and love to Miss Marianne , "" I am , & c ."" As soon as Elinor had finished it , she performed what she concluded to be its writer ' s real design , by placing it in the hands of Mrs . Jennings , who read it aloud with many comments of satisfaction and praise . "" Very well indeed !-- how prettily she writes !-- aye , that was quite proper to let him be off if he would . That was just like Lucy .-- Poor soul !"
austen#"I wish I COULD get him a living , with all my heart .-- She calls me dear Mrs . Jennings , you see . She is a good - hearted girl as ever lived .-- Very well upon my word . That sentence is very prettily turned . Yes , yes , I will go and see her , sure enough . How attentive she is , to think of every body !-- Thank you , my dear , for shewing it me . It is as pretty a letter as ever I saw , and does Lucy ' s head and heart great credit ."""
austen#CHAPTER 39 The Miss Dashwoods had now been rather more than two months in town , and Marianne ' s impatience to be gone increased every day . She sighed for the air , the liberty , the quiet of the country ; and fancied that if any place could give her ease , Barton must do it . Elinor was hardly less anxious than herself for their removal , and only so much less bent on its being effected immediately , as that she was conscious of the difficulties of so long a journey , which Marianne could not be brought to acknowledge . She began , however , seriously to turn her thoughts towards its accomplishment , and had already mentioned their wishes to their kind hostess , who resisted them with all the eloquence of her good - will , when a plan was suggested , which , though detaining them from home yet a few weeks longer , appeared to Elinor altogether much more eligible than any other . The Palmers were to remove to Cleveland about the end of March , for the Easter holidays ; and Mrs . Jennings , with both her friends , received a very warm invitation from Charlotte to go with them .
austen#"This would not , in itself , have been sufficient for the delicacy of Miss Dashwood ;-- but it was inforced with so much real politeness by Mr . Palmer himself , as , joined to the very great amendment of his manners towards them since her sister had been known to be unhappy , induced her to accept it with pleasure . When she told Marianne what she had done , however , her first reply was not very auspicious . "" Cleveland !"" -- she cried , with great agitation . "" No , I cannot go to Cleveland ."" --"
austen#""" You forget ,"" said Elinor gently , "" that its situation is not ... that it is not in the neighbourhood of ..."" "" But it is in Somersetshire .-- I cannot go into Somersetshire .-- There , where I looked forward to going ... No , Elinor , you cannot expect me to go there ."" Elinor would not argue upon the propriety of overcoming such feelings ;-- she only endeavoured to counteract them by working on others ;-- represented it , therefore , as a measure which would fix the time of her returning to that dear mother , whom she so much wished to see , in a more eligible , more comfortable manner , than any other plan could do , and perhaps without any greater delay . From Cleveland , which was within a few miles of Bristol , the distance to Barton was not beyond one day , though a long day ' s journey ; and their mother ' s servant might easily come there to attend them down ; and as there could be no occasion of their staying above a week at Cleveland , they might now be at home in little more than three weeks ' time . As Marianne ' s affection for her mother was sincere , it must triumph with little difficulty , over the imaginary evils she had started . Mrs . Jennings was so far from being weary of her guest , that she pressed them very earnestly to return with her again from Cleveland ."
austen#"Elinor was grateful for the attention , but it could not alter her design ; and their mother ' s concurrence being readily gained , every thing relative to their return was arranged as far as it could be ;-- and Marianne found some relief in drawing up a statement of the hours that were yet to divide her from Barton . "" Ah ! Colonel , I do not know what you and I shall do without the Miss Dashwoods ;""-- was Mrs . Jennings ' s address to him when he first called on her , after their leaving her was settled --"" for they are quite resolved upon going home from the Palmers ;-- and how forlorn we shall be , when I come back !-- Lord ! we shall sit and gape at one another as dull as two cats ."" Perhaps Mrs . Jennings was in hopes , by this vigorous sketch of their future ennui , to provoke him to make that offer , which might give himself an escape from it ;-- and if so , she had soon afterwards good reason to think her object gained ; for , on Elinor ' s moving to the window to take more expeditiously the dimensions of a print , which she was going to copy for her friend , he followed her to it with a look of particular meaning , and conversed with her there for several minutes . The effect of his discourse on the lady too , could not escape her observation , for though she was too honorable to listen , and had even changed her seat , on purpose that she might NOT hear , to one close by the piano forte on which Marianne was playing , she could not keep herself from seeing that Elinor changed colour , attended with agitation , and was too intent on what he said to pursue her employment .-- Still farther in confirmation of her hopes , in the interval of Marianne ' s turning from one lesson to another , some words of the Colonel ' s inevitably reached her ear , in which he seemed to be apologising for the badness of his house ."
austen#"This set the matter beyond a doubt . She wondered , indeed , at his thinking it necessary to do so ; but supposed it to be the proper etiquette . What Elinor said in reply she could not distinguish , but judged from the motion of her lips , that she did not think THAT any material objection ;-- and Mrs . Jennings commended her in her heart for being so honest . They then talked on for a few minutes longer without her catching a syllable , when another lucky stop in Marianne ' s performance brought her these words in the Colonel ' s calm voice ,-- "" I am afraid it cannot take place very soon ."" Astonished and shocked at so unlover - like a speech , she was almost ready to cry out , "" Lord !"
austen#"what should hinder it ?"" -- but checking her desire , confined herself to this silent ejaculation . "" This is very strange !-- sure he need not wait to be older ."" This delay on the Colonel ' s side , however , did not seem to offend or mortify his fair companion in the least , for on their breaking up the conference soon afterwards , and moving different ways , Mrs . Jennings very plainly heard Elinor say , and with a voice which shewed her to feel what she said , "" I shall always think myself very much obliged to you ."" Mrs . Jennings was delighted with her gratitude , and only wondered that after hearing such a sentence , the Colonel should be able to take leave of them , as he immediately did , with the utmost sang - froid , and go away without making her any reply !-- She had not thought her old friend could have made so indifferent a suitor ."
austen#"What had really passed between them was to this effect . "" I have heard ,"" said he , with great compassion , "" of the injustice your friend Mr . Ferrars has suffered from his family ; for if I understand the matter right , he has been entirely cast off by them for persevering in his engagement with a very deserving young woman .-- Have I been rightly informed ?-- Is it so ?--"" Elinor told him that it was . "" The cruelty , the impolitic cruelty ,""-- he replied , with great feeling ,--"" of dividing , or attempting to divide , two young people long attached to each other , is terrible .-- Mrs . Ferrars does not know what she may be doing -- what she may drive her son to . I have seen Mr . Ferrars two or three times in Harley Street , and am much pleased with him . He is not a young man with whom one can be intimately acquainted in a short time , but I have seen enough of him to wish him well for his own sake , and as a friend of yours , I wish it still more ."
austen#"I understand that he intends to take orders . Will you be so good as to tell him that the living of Delaford , now just vacant , as I am informed by this day ' s post , is his , if he think it worth his acceptance -- but THAT , perhaps , so unfortunately circumstanced as he is now , it may be nonsense to appear to doubt ; I only wish it were more valuable .-- It is a rectory , but a small one ; the late incumbent , I believe , did not make more than 200 L per annum , and though it is certainly capable of improvement , I fear , not to such an amount as to afford him a very comfortable income . Such as it is , however , my pleasure in presenting him to it , will be very great . Pray assure him of it ."" Elinor ' s astonishment at this commission could hardly have been greater , had the Colonel been really making her an offer of his hand . The preferment , which only two days before she had considered as hopeless for Edward , was already provided to enable him to marry ;-- and SHE , of all people in the world , was fixed on to bestow it !-- Her emotion was such as Mrs . Jennings had attributed to a very different cause ;-- but whatever minor feelings less pure , less pleasing , might have a share in that emotion , her esteem for the general benevolence , and her gratitude for the particular friendship , which together prompted Colonel Brandon to this act , were strongly felt , and warmly expressed ."
austen#She thanked him for it with all her heart , spoke of Edward ' s principles and disposition with that praise which she knew them to deserve ; and promised to undertake the commission with pleasure , if it were really his wish to put off so agreeable an office to another . But at the same time , she could not help thinking that no one could so well perform it as himself . It was an office in short , from which , unwilling to give Edward the pain of receiving an obligation from HER , she would have been very glad to be spared herself ;-- but Colonel Brandon , on motives of equal delicacy , declining it likewise , still seemed so desirous of its being given through her means , that she would not on any account make farther opposition . Edward , she believed , was still in town , and fortunately she had heard his address from Miss Steele . She could undertake therefore to inform him of it , in the course of the day . After this had been settled , Colonel Brandon began to talk of his own advantage in securing so respectable and agreeable a neighbour , and THEN it was that he mentioned with regret , that the house was small and indifferent ;-- an evil which Elinor , as Mrs . Jennings had supposed her to do , made very light of , at least as far as regarded its size .
austen#""" The smallness of the house ,"" said she , "" I cannot imagine any inconvenience to them , for it will be in proportion to their family and income ."" By which the Colonel was surprised to find that SHE was considering Mr . Ferrars ' s marriage as the certain consequence of the presentation ; for he did not suppose it possible that Delaford living could supply such an income , as anybody in his style of life would venture to settle on -- and he said so . "" This little rectory CAN do no more than make Mr . Ferrars comfortable as a bachelor ; it cannot enable him to marry . I am sorry to say that my patronage ends with this ; and my interest is hardly more extensive . If , however , by an unforeseen chance it should be in my power to serve him farther , I must think very differently of him from what I now do , if I am not as ready to be useful to him then as I sincerely wish I could be at present . What I am now doing indeed , seems nothing at all , since it can advance him so little towards what must be his principal , his only object of happiness ."
austen#"His marriage must still be a distant good ;-- at least , I am afraid it cannot take place very soon .--"" Such was the sentence which , when misunderstood , so justly offended the delicate feelings of Mrs . Jennings ; but after this narration of what really passed between Colonel Brandon and Elinor , while they stood at the window , the gratitude expressed by the latter on their parting , may perhaps appear in general , not less reasonably excited , nor less properly worded than if it had arisen from an offer of marriage . CHAPTER 40 "" Well , Miss Dashwood ,"" said Mrs . Jennings , sagaciously smiling , as soon as the gentleman had withdrawn , "" I do not ask you what the Colonel has been saying to you ; for though , upon my honour , I TRIED to keep out of hearing , I could not help catching enough to understand his business . And I assure you I never was better pleased in my life , and I wish you joy of it with all my heart ."" "" Thank you , ma ' am ,"" said Elinor ."
austen#""" It is a matter of great joy to me ; and I feel the goodness of Colonel Brandon most sensibly . There are not many men who would act as he has done . Few people who have so compassionate a heart ! I never was more astonished in my life ."" "" Lord ! my dear , you are very modest ."
austen#"I an ' t the least astonished at it in the world , for I have often thought of late , there was nothing more likely to happen ."" "" You judged from your knowledge of the Colonel ' s general benevolence ; but at least you could not foresee that the opportunity would so very soon occur ."" "" Opportunity !"" repeated Mrs . Jennings --"" Oh ! as to that , when a man has once made up his mind to such a thing , somehow or other he will soon find an opportunity . Well , my dear , I wish you joy of it again and again ; and if ever there was a happy couple in the world , I think I shall soon know where to look for them ."""
austen#""" You mean to go to Delaford after them I suppose ,"" said Elinor , with a faint smile . "" Aye , my dear , that I do , indeed . And as to the house being a bad one , I do not know what the Colonel would be at , for it is as good a one as ever I saw ."" "" He spoke of its being out of repair ."" "" Well , and whose fault is that ? why don ' t he repair it ?-- who should do it but himself ?"""
austen#"They were interrupted by the servant ' s coming in to announce the carriage being at the door ; and Mrs . Jennings immediately preparing to go , said ,-- "" Well , my dear , I must be gone before I have had half my talk out . But , however , we may have it all over in the evening ; for we shall be quite alone . I do not ask you to go with me , for I dare say your mind is too full of the matter to care for company ; and besides , you must long to tell your sister all about it ."" Marianne had left the room before the conversation began . "" Certainly , ma ' am , I shall tell Marianne of it ; but I shall not mention it at present to any body else ."""
austen#""" Oh ! very well ,"" said Mrs . Jennings rather disappointed . "" Then you would not have me tell it to Lucy , for I think of going as far as Holborn to - day ."" "" No , ma ' am , not even Lucy if you please . One day ' s delay will not be very material ; and till I have written to Mr . Ferrars , I think it ought not to be mentioned to any body else . I shall do THAT directly ."
austen#"It is of importance that no time should be lost with him , for he will of course have much to do relative to his ordination ."" This speech at first puzzled Mrs . Jennings exceedingly . Why Mr . Ferrars was to have been written to about it in such a hurry , she could not immediately comprehend . A few moments ' reflection , however , produced a very happy idea , and she exclaimed ;-- "" Oh , ho !-- I understand you . Mr . Ferrars is to be the man ."
austen#"Well , so much the better for him . Ay , to be sure , he must be ordained in readiness ; and I am very glad to find things are so forward between you . But , my dear , is not this rather out of character ? Should not the Colonel write himself ?-- sure , he is the proper person ."" Elinor did not quite understand the beginning of Mrs . Jennings ' s speech , neither did she think it worth inquiring into ; and therefore only replied to its conclusion . "" Colonel Brandon is so delicate a man , that he rather wished any one to announce his intentions to Mr . Ferrars than himself ."""
austen#""" And so YOU are forced to do it . Well THAT is an odd kind of delicacy ! However , I will not disturb you ( seeing her preparing to write .) You know your own concerns best . So goodby , my dear . I have not heard of any thing to please me so well since Charlotte was brought to bed ."""
austen#"And away she went ; but returning again in a moment , "" I have just been thinking of Betty ' s sister , my dear . I should be very glad to get her so good a mistress . But whether she would do for a lady ' s maid , I am sure I can ' t tell . She is an excellent housemaid , and works very well at her needle . However , you will think of all that at your leisure ."""
austen#""" Certainly , ma ' am ,"" replied Elinor , not hearing much of what she said , and more anxious to be alone , than to be mistress of the subject . How she should begin -- how she should express herself in her note to Edward , was now all her concern . The particular circumstances between them made a difficulty of that which to any other person would have been the easiest thing in the world ; but she equally feared to say too much or too little , and sat deliberating over her paper , with the pen in her band , till broken in on by the entrance of Edward himself . He had met Mrs . Jennings at the door in her way to the carriage , as he came to leave his farewell card ; and she , after apologising for not returning herself , had obliged him to enter , by saying that Miss Dashwood was above , and wanted to speak with him on very particular business . Elinor had just been congratulating herself , in the midst of her perplexity , that however difficult it might be to express herself properly by letter , it was at least preferable to giving the information by word of mouth , when her visitor entered , to force her upon this greatest exertion of all . Her astonishment and confusion were very great on his so sudden appearance ."
austen#"She had not seen him before since his engagement became public , and therefore not since his knowing her to be acquainted with it ; which , with the consciousness of what she had been thinking of , and what she had to tell him , made her feel particularly uncomfortable for some minutes . He too was much distressed ; and they sat down together in a most promising state of embarrassment .-- Whether he had asked her pardon for his intrusion on first coming into the room , he could not recollect ; but determining to be on the safe side , he made his apology in form as soon as he could say any thing , after taking a chair . "" Mrs . Jennings told me ,"" said he , "" that you wished to speak with me , at least I understood her so -- or I certainly should not have intruded on you in such a manner ; though at the same time , I should have been extremely sorry to leave London without seeing you and your sister ; especially as it will most likely be some time -- it is not probable that I should soon have the pleasure of meeting you again . I go to Oxford tomorrow ."" "" You would not have gone , however ,"" said Elinor , recovering herself , and determined to get over what she so much dreaded as soon as possible , "" without receiving our good wishes , even if we had not been able to give them in person . Mrs . Jennings was quite right in what she said ."
austen#"I have something of consequence to inform you of , which I was on the point of communicating by paper . I am charged with a most agreeable office ( breathing rather faster than usual as she spoke .) Colonel Brandon , who was here only ten minutes ago , has desired me to say , that understanding you mean to take orders , he has great pleasure in offering you the living of Delaford now just vacant , and only wishes it were more valuable . Allow me to congratulate you on having so respectable and well - judging a friend , and to join in his wish that the living -- it is about two hundred a - year -- were much more considerable , and such as might better enable you to -- as might be more than a temporary accommodation to yourself -- such , in short , as might establish all your views of happiness ."" What Edward felt , as he could not say it himself , it cannot be expected that any one else should say for him . He LOOKED all the astonishment which such unexpected , such unthought - of information could not fail of exciting ; but he said only these two words ,"
austen#""" Colonel Brandon !"" "" Yes ,"" continued Elinor , gathering more resolution , as some of the worst was over , "" Colonel Brandon means it as a testimony of his concern for what has lately passed -- for the cruel situation in which the unjustifiable conduct of your family has placed you -- a concern which I am sure Marianne , myself , and all your friends , must share ; and likewise as a proof of his high esteem for your general character , and his particular approbation of your behaviour on the present occasion ."" "" Colonel Brandon give ME a living !-- Can it be possible ?"" "" The unkindness of your own relations has made you astonished to find friendship any where ."" "" No ,"" replied be , with sudden consciousness , "" not to find it in YOU ; for I cannot be ignorant that to you , to your goodness , I owe it all .-- I feel it -- I would express it if I could -- but , as you well know , I am no orator ."" "" You are very much mistaken ."
austen#"I do assure you that you owe it entirely , at least almost entirely , to your own merit , and Colonel Brandon ' s discernment of it . I have had no hand in it . I did not even know , till I understood his design , that the living was vacant ; nor had it ever occurred to me that he might have had such a living in his gift . As a friend of mine , of my family , he may , perhaps -- indeed I know he HAS , still greater pleasure in bestowing it ; but , upon my word , you owe nothing to my solicitation ."" Truth obliged her to acknowledge some small share in the action , but she was at the same time so unwilling to appear as the benefactress of Edward , that she acknowledged it with hesitation ; which probably contributed to fix that suspicion in his mind which had recently entered it . For a short time he sat deep in thought , after Elinor had ceased to speak ;-- at last , and as if it were rather an effort , he said ,"
austen#""" Colonel Brandon seems a man of great worth and respectability . I have always heard him spoken of as such , and your brother I know esteems him highly . He is undoubtedly a sensible man , and in his manners perfectly the gentleman ."" "" Indeed ,"" replied Elinor , "" I believe that you will find him , on farther acquaintance , all that you have heard him to be , and as you will be such very near neighbours ( for I understand the parsonage is almost close to the mansion - house ,) it is particularly important that he SHOULD be all this ."" Edward made no answer ; but when she had turned away her head , gave her a look so serious , so earnest , so uncheerful , as seemed to say , that he might hereafter wish the distance between the parsonage and the mansion - house much greater . "" Colonel Brandon , I think , lodges in St . James Street ,"" said he , soon afterwards , rising from his chair ."
austen#"Elinor told him the number of the house . "" I must hurry away then , to give him those thanks which you will not allow me to give YOU ; to assure him that he has made me a very -- an exceedingly happy man ."" Elinor did not offer to detain him ; and they parted , with a very earnest assurance on HER side of her unceasing good wishes for his happiness in every change of situation that might befall him ; on HIS , with rather an attempt to return the same good will , than the power of expressing it . "" When I see him again ,"" said Elinor to herself , as the door shut him out , "" I shall see him the husband of Lucy ."" And with this pleasing anticipation , she sat down to reconsider the past , recall the words and endeavour to comprehend all the feelings of Edward ; and , of course , to reflect on her own with discontent . When Mrs . Jennings came home , though she returned from seeing people whom she had never seen before , and of whom therefore she must have a great deal to say , her mind was so much more occupied by the important secret in her possession , than by anything else , that she reverted to it again as soon as Elinor appeared ."
austen#""" Well , my dear ,"" she cried , "" I sent you up to the young man . Did not I do right ?-- And I suppose you had no great difficulty -- You did not find him very unwilling to accept your proposal ?"" "" No , ma ' am ; THAT was not very likely ."" "" Well , and how soon will he be ready ?-- For it seems all to depend upon that ."" "" Really ,"" said Elinor , "" I know so little of these kind of forms , that I can hardly even conjecture as to the time , or the preparation necessary ; but I suppose two or three months will complete his ordination ."" "" Two or three months !"""
austen#"cried Mrs . Jennings ; "" Lord ! my dear , how calmly you talk of it ; and can the Colonel wait two or three months ! Lord bless me !-- I am sure it would put ME quite out of patience !-- And though one would be very glad to do a kindness by poor Mr . Ferrars , I do think it is not worth while to wait two or three months for him . Sure somebody else might be found that would do as well ; somebody that is in orders already ."" "" My dear ma ' am ,"" said Elinor , "" what can you be thinking of ?-- Why , Colonel Brandon ' s only object is to be of use to Mr . Ferrars ."""
austen#""" Lord bless you , my dear !-- Sure you do not mean to persuade me that the Colonel only marries you for the sake of giving ten guineas to Mr . Ferrars !"" The deception could not continue after this ; and an explanation immediately took place , by which both gained considerable amusement for the moment , without any material loss of happiness to either , for Mrs . Jennings only exchanged one form of delight for another , and still without forfeiting her expectation of the first . "" Aye , aye , the parsonage is but a small one ,"" said she , after the first ebullition of surprise and satisfaction was over , "" and very likely MAY be out of repair ; but to hear a man apologising , as I thought , for a house that to my knowledge has five sitting rooms on the ground - floor , and I think the housekeeper told me could make up fifteen beds !-- and to you too , that had been used to live in Barton cottage !-- It seems quite ridiculous . But , my dear , we must touch up the Colonel to do some thing to the parsonage , and make it comfortable for them , before Lucy goes to it ."" "" But Colonel Brandon does not seem to have any idea of the living ' s being enough to allow them to marry ."""
austen#""" The Colonel is a ninny , my dear ; because he has two thousand a - year himself , he thinks that nobody else can marry on less . Take my word for it , that , if I am alive , I shall be paying a visit at Delaford Parsonage before Michaelmas ; and I am sure I sha ' nt go if Lucy an ' t there ."" Elinor was quite of her opinion , as to the probability of their not waiting for any thing more . CHAPTER 41 Edward , having carried his thanks to Colonel Brandon , proceeded with his happiness to Lucy ; and such was the excess of it by the time he reached Bartlett ' s Buildings , that she was able to assure Mrs . Jennings , who called on her again the next day with her congratulations , that she had never seen him in such spirits before in her life . Her own happiness , and her own spirits , were at least very certain ; and she joined Mrs . Jennings most heartily in her expectation of their being all comfortably together in Delaford Parsonage before Michaelmas ."
austen#So far was she , at the same time , from any backwardness to give Elinor that credit which Edward WOULD give her , that she spoke of her friendship for them both with the most grateful warmth , was ready to own all their obligation to her , and openly declared that no exertion for their good on Miss Dashwood ' s part , either present or future , would ever surprise her , for she believed her capable of doing any thing in the world for those she really valued . As for Colonel Brandon , she was not only ready to worship him as a saint , but was moreover truly anxious that he should be treated as one in all worldly concerns ; anxious that his tithes should be raised to the utmost ; and scarcely resolved to avail herself , at Delaford , as far as she possibly could , of his servants , his carriage , his cows , and his poultry . It was now above a week since John Dashwood had called in Berkeley Street , and as since that time no notice had been taken by them of his wife ' s indisposition , beyond one verbal enquiry , Elinor began to feel it necessary to pay her a visit .-- This was an obligation , however , which not only opposed her own inclination , but which had not the assistance of any encouragement from her companions . Marianne , not contented with absolutely refusing to go herself , was very urgent to prevent her sister ' s going at all ; and Mrs . Jennings , though her carriage was always at Elinor ' s service , so very much disliked Mrs . John Dashwood , that not even her curiosity to see how she looked after the late discovery , nor her strong desire to affront her by taking Edward ' s part , could overcome her unwillingness to be in her company again . The consequence was , that Elinor set out by herself to pay a visit , for which no one could really have less inclination , and to run the risk of a tete - a - tete with a woman , whom neither of the others had so much reason to dislike . Mrs . Dashwood was denied ; but before the carriage could turn from the house , her husband accidentally came out .
austen#"He expressed great pleasure in meeting Elinor , told her that he had been just going to call in Berkeley Street , and , assuring her that Fanny would be very glad to see her , invited her to come in . They walked up stairs in to the drawing - room .-- Nobody was there . "" Fanny is in her own room , I suppose ,"" said he :--"" I will go to her presently , for I am sure she will not have the least objection in the world to seeing YOU .-- Very far from it , indeed . NOW especially there cannot be -- but however , you and Marianne were always great favourites .-- Why would not Marianne come ?"" -- Elinor made what excuse she could for her ."
austen#""" I am not sorry to see you alone ,"" he replied , "" for I have a good deal to say to you . This living of Colonel Brandon ' s -- can it be true ?-- has he really given it to Edward ?-- I heard it yesterday by chance , and was coming to you on purpose to enquire farther about it ."" "" It is perfectly true .-- Colonel Brandon has given the living of Delaford to Edward ."" "" Really !-- Well , this is very astonishing !-- no relationship !-- no connection between them !-- and now that livings fetch such a price !-- what was the value of this ?"" "" About two hundred a year ."" "" Very well -- and for the next presentation to a living of that value -- supposing the late incumbent to have been old and sickly , and likely to vacate it soon -- he might have got I dare say -- fourteen hundred pounds ."
austen#"And how came he not to have settled that matter before this person ' s death ?-- NOW indeed it would be too late to sell it , but a man of Colonel Brandon ' s sense !-- I wonder he should be so improvident in a point of such common , such natural , concern !-- Well , I am convinced that there is a vast deal of inconsistency in almost every human character . I suppose , however -- on recollection -- that the case may probably be THIS . Edward is only to hold the living till the person to whom the Colonel has really sold the presentation , is old enough to take it .-- Aye , aye , that is the fact , depend upon it ."" Elinor contradicted it , however , very positively ; and by relating that she had herself been employed in conveying the offer from Colonel Brandon to Edward , and , therefore , must understand the terms on which it was given , obliged him to submit to her authority . "" It is truly astonishing !"" -- he cried , after hearing what she said --"" what could be the Colonel ' s motive ?"""
austen#""" A very simple one -- to be of use to Mr . Ferrars ."" "" Well , well ; whatever Colonel Brandon may be , Edward is a very lucky man .-- You will not mention the matter to Fanny , however , for though I have broke it to her , and she bears it vastly well ,-- she will not like to hear it much talked of ."" Elinor had some difficulty here to refrain from observing , that she thought Fanny might have borne with composure , an acquisition of wealth to her brother , by which neither she nor her child could be possibly impoverished . "" Mrs . Ferrars ,"" added he , lowering his voice to the tone becoming so important a subject , "" knows nothing about it at present , and I believe it will be best to keep it entirely concealed from her as long as may be .-- When the marriage takes place , I fear she must hear of it all ."" "" But why should such precaution be used ?-- Though it is not to be supposed that Mrs . Ferrars can have the smallest satisfaction in knowing that her son has money enough to live upon ,-- for THAT must be quite out of the question ; yet why , upon her late behaviour , is she supposed to feel at all ?-- She has done with her son , she cast him off for ever , and has made all those over whom she had any influence , cast him off likewise ."
austen#"Surely , after doing so , she cannot be imagined liable to any impression of sorrow or of joy on his account -- she cannot be interested in any thing that befalls him .-- She would not be so weak as to throw away the comfort of a child , and yet retain the anxiety of a parent !"" "" Ah ! Elinor ,"" said John , "" your reasoning is very good , but it is founded on ignorance of human nature . When Edward ' s unhappy match takes place , depend upon it his mother will feel as much as if she had never discarded him ; and , therefore every circumstance that may accelerate that dreadful event , must be concealed from her as much as possible . Mrs . Ferrars can never forget that Edward is her son ."" "" You surprise me ; I should think it must nearly have escaped her memory by THIS time ."""
austen#""" You wrong her exceedingly . Mrs . Ferrars is one of the most affectionate mothers in the world ."" Elinor was silent . "" We think NOW ,""-- said Mr . Dashwood , after a short pause , "" of ROBERT ' S marrying Miss Morton ."" Elinor , smiling at the grave and decisive importance of her brother ' s tone , calmly replied , "" The lady , I suppose , has no choice in the affair ."""
austen#""" Choice !-- how do you mean ?"" "" I only mean that I suppose , from your manner of speaking , it must be the same to Miss Morton whether she marry Edward or Robert ."" "" Certainly , there can be no difference ; for Robert will now to all intents and purposes be considered as the eldest son ;-- and as to any thing else , they are both very agreeable young men : I do not know that one is superior to the other ."" Elinor said no more , and John was also for a short time silent .-- His reflections ended thus . "" Of ONE thing , my dear sister ,"" kindly taking her hand , and speaking in an awful whisper ,--"" I may assure you ;-- and I WILL do it , because I know it must gratify you . I have good reason to think -- indeed I have it from the best authority , or I should not repeat it , for otherwise it would be very wrong to say any thing about it -- but I have it from the very best authority -- not that I ever precisely heard Mrs . Ferrars say it herself -- but her daughter DID , and I have it from her -- That in short , whatever objections there might be against a certain -- a certain connection -- you understand me -- it would have been far preferable to her , it would not have given her half the vexation that THIS does ."
austen#I was exceedingly pleased to hear that Mrs . Ferrars considered it in that light -- a very gratifying circumstance you know to us all . ' It would have been beyond comparison ,' she said , ' the least evil of the two , and she would be glad to compound NOW for nothing worse .' But however , all that is quite out of the question -- not to be thought of or mentioned -- as to any attachment you know -- it never could be -- all that is gone by . But I thought I would just tell you of this , because I knew how much it must please you . Not that you have any reason to regret , my dear Elinor . There is no doubt of your doing exceedingly well -- quite as well , or better , perhaps , all things considered .
austen#"Has Colonel Brandon been with you lately ?"" Elinor had heard enough , if not to gratify her vanity , and raise her self - importance , to agitate her nerves and fill her mind ;-- and she was therefore glad to be spared from the necessity of saying much in reply herself , and from the danger of hearing any thing more from her brother , by the entrance of Mr . Robert Ferrars . After a few moments ' chat , John Dashwood , recollecting that Fanny was yet uninformed of her sister ' s being there , quitted the room in quest of her ; and Elinor was left to improve her acquaintance with Robert , who , by the gay unconcern , the happy self - complacency of his manner while enjoying so unfair a division of his mother ' s love and liberality , to the prejudice of his banished brother , earned only by his own dissipated course of life , and that brother ' s integrity , was confirming her most unfavourable opinion of his head and heart . They had scarcely been two minutes by themselves , before he began to speak of Edward ; for he , too , had heard of the living , and was very inquisitive on the subject . Elinor repeated the particulars of it , as she had given them to John ; and their effect on Robert , though very different , was not less striking than it had been on HIM . He laughed most immoderately ."
austen#"The idea of Edward ' s being a clergyman , and living in a small parsonage - house , diverted him beyond measure ;-- and when to that was added the fanciful imagery of Edward reading prayers in a white surplice , and publishing the banns of marriage between John Smith and Mary Brown , he could conceive nothing more ridiculous . Elinor , while she waited in silence and immovable gravity , the conclusion of such folly , could not restrain her eyes from being fixed on him with a look that spoke all the contempt it excited . It was a look , however , very well bestowed , for it relieved her own feelings , and gave no intelligence to him . He was recalled from wit to wisdom , not by any reproof of her ' s , but by his own sensibility . "" We may treat it as a joke ,"" said he , at last , recovering from the affected laugh which had considerably lengthened out the genuine gaiety of the moment --"" but , upon my soul , it is a most serious business . Poor Edward !"
austen#"he is ruined for ever . I am extremely sorry for it -- for I know him to be a very good - hearted creature ; as well - meaning a fellow perhaps , as any in the world . You must not judge of him , Miss Dashwood , from YOUR slight acquaintance .-- Poor Edward !-- His manners are certainly not the happiest in nature .-- But we are not all born , you know , with the same powers ,-- the same address .-- Poor fellow !-- to see him in a circle of strangers !-- to be sure it was pitiable enough !-- but upon my soul , I believe he has as good a heart as any in the kingdom ; and I declare and protest to you I never was so shocked in my life , as when it all burst forth . I could not believe it .-- My mother was the first person who told me of it ; and I , feeling myself called on to act with resolution , immediately said to her , ' My dear madam , I do not know what you may intend to do on the occasion , but as for myself , I must say , that if Edward does marry this young woman , I never will see him again .' That was what I said immediately .-- I was most uncommonly shocked , indeed !-- Poor Edward !-- he has done for himself completely -- shut himself out for ever from all decent society !-- but , as I directly said to my mother , I am not in the least surprised at it ; from his style of education , it was always to be expected . My poor mother was half frantic ."""
austen#""" Have you ever seen the lady ?"" "" Yes ; once , while she was staying in this house , I happened to drop in for ten minutes ; and I saw quite enough of her . The merest awkward country girl , without style , or elegance , and almost without beauty .-- I remember her perfectly . Just the kind of girl I should suppose likely to captivate poor Edward . I offered immediately , as soon as my mother related the affair to me , to talk to him myself , and dissuade him from the match ; but it was too late THEN , I found , to do any thing , for unluckily , I was not in the way at first , and knew nothing of it till after the breach had taken place , when it was not for me , you know , to interfere . But had I been informed of it a few hours earlier -- I think it is most probable -- that something might have been hit on ."
austen#"I certainly should have represented it to Edward in a very strong light . ' My dear fellow ,' I should have said , ' consider what you are doing . You are making a most disgraceful connection , and such a one as your family are unanimous in disapproving .' I cannot help thinking , in short , that means might have been found . But now it is all too late . He must be starved , you know ;-- that is certain ; absolutely starved ."""
austen#He had just settled this point with great composure , when the entrance of Mrs . John Dashwood put an end to the subject . But though SHE never spoke of it out of her own family , Elinor could see its influence on her mind , in the something like confusion of countenance with which she entered , and an attempt at cordiality in her behaviour to herself . She even proceeded so far as to be concerned to find that Elinor and her sister were so soon to leave town , as she had hoped to see more of them ;-- an exertion in which her husband , who attended her into the room , and hung enamoured over her accents , seemed to distinguish every thing that was most affectionate and graceful . CHAPTER 42 One other short call in Harley Street , in which Elinor received her brother ' s congratulations on their travelling so far towards Barton without any expense , and on Colonel Brandon ' s being to follow them to Cleveland in a day or two , completed the intercourse of the brother and sisters in town ;-- and a faint invitation from Fanny , to come to Norland whenever it should happen to be in their way , which of all things was the most unlikely to occur , with a more warm , though less public , assurance , from John to Elinor , of the promptitude with which he should come to see her at Delaford , was all that foretold any meeting in the country . It amused her to observe that all her friends seemed determined to send her to Delaford ;-- a place , in which , of all others , she would now least chuse to visit , or wish to reside ; for not only was it considered as her future home by her brother and Mrs . Jennings , but even Lucy , when they parted , gave her a pressing invitation to visit her there .
austen#Very early in April , and tolerably early in the day , the two parties from Hanover Square and Berkeley Street set out from their respective homes , to meet , by appointment , on the road . For the convenience of Charlotte and her child , they were to be more than two days on their journey , and Mr . Palmer , travelling more expeditiously with Colonel Brandon , was to join them at Cleveland soon after their arrival . Marianne , few as had been her hours of comfort in London , and eager as she had long been to quit it , could not , when it came to the point , bid adieu to the house in which she had for the last time enjoyed those hopes , and that confidence , in Willoughby , which were now extinguished for ever , without great pain . Nor could she leave the place in which Willoughby remained , busy in new engagements , and new schemes , in which SHE could have no share , without shedding many tears . Elinor ' s satisfaction , at the moment of removal , was more positive . She had no such object for her lingering thoughts to fix on , she left no creature behind , from whom it would give her a moment ' s regret to be divided for ever , she was pleased to be free herself from the persecution of Lucy ' s friendship , she was grateful for bringing her sister away unseen by Willoughby since his marriage , and she looked forward with hope to what a few months of tranquility at Barton might do towards restoring Marianne ' s peace of mind , and confirming her own .
austen#Their journey was safely performed . The second day brought them into the cherished , or the prohibited , county of Somerset , for as such was it dwelt on by turns in Marianne ' s imagination ; and in the forenoon of the third they drove up to Cleveland . Cleveland was a spacious , modern - built house , situated on a sloping lawn . It had no park , but the pleasure - grounds were tolerably extensive ; and like every other place of the same degree of importance , it had its open shrubbery , and closer wood walk , a road of smooth gravel winding round a plantation , led to the front , the lawn was dotted over with timber , the house itself was under the guardianship of the fir , the mountain - ash , and the acacia , and a thick screen of them altogether , interspersed with tall Lombardy poplars , shut out the offices . Marianne entered the house with a heart swelling with emotion from the consciousness of being only eighty miles from Barton , and not thirty from Combe Magna ; and before she had been five minutes within its walls , while the others were busily helping Charlotte to show her child to the housekeeper , she quitted it again , stealing away through the winding shrubberies , now just beginning to be in beauty , to gain a distant eminence ; where , from its Grecian temple , her eye , wandering over a wide tract of country to the south - east , could fondly rest on the farthest ridge of hills in the horizon , and fancy that from their summits Combe Magna might be seen . In such moments of precious , invaluable misery , she rejoiced in tears of agony to be at Cleveland ; and as she returned by a different circuit to the house , feeling all the happy privilege of country liberty , of wandering from place to place in free and luxurious solitude , she resolved to spend almost every hour of every day while she remained with the Palmers , in the indulgence of such solitary rambles .
austen#She returned just in time to join the others as they quitted the house , on an excursion through its more immediate premises ; and the rest of the morning was easily whiled away , in lounging round the kitchen garden , examining the bloom upon its walls , and listening to the gardener ' s lamentations upon blights , in dawdling through the green - house , where the loss of her favourite plants , unwarily exposed , and nipped by the lingering frost , raised the laughter of Charlotte ,-- and in visiting her poultry - yard , where , in the disappointed hopes of her dairy - maid , by hens forsaking their nests , or being stolen by a fox , or in the rapid decrease of a promising young brood , she found fresh sources of merriment . The morning was fine and dry , and Marianne , in her plan of employment abroad , had not calculated for any change of weather during their stay at Cleveland . With great surprise therefore , did she find herself prevented by a settled rain from going out again after dinner . She had depended on a twilight walk to the Grecian temple , and perhaps all over the grounds , and an evening merely cold or damp would not have deterred her from it ; but a heavy and settled rain even SHE could not fancy dry or pleasant weather for walking . Their party was small , and the hours passed quietly away . Mrs . Palmer had her child , and Mrs . Jennings her carpet - work ; they talked of the friends they had left behind , arranged Lady Middleton ' s engagements , and wondered whether Mr . Palmer and Colonel Brandon would get farther than Reading that night .
austen#Elinor , however little concerned in it , joined in their discourse ; and Marianne , who had the knack of finding her way in every house to the library , however it might be avoided by the family in general , soon procured herself a book . Nothing was wanting on Mrs . Palmer ' s side that constant and friendly good humour could do , to make them feel themselves welcome . The openness and heartiness of her manner more than atoned for that want of recollection and elegance which made her often deficient in the forms of politeness ; her kindness , recommended by so pretty a face , was engaging ; her folly , though evident was not disgusting , because it was not conceited ; and Elinor could have forgiven every thing but her laugh . The two gentlemen arrived the next day to a very late dinner , affording a pleasant enlargement of the party , and a very welcome variety to their conversation , which a long morning of the same continued rain had reduced very low . Elinor had seen so little of Mr . Palmer , and in that little had seen so much variety in his address to her sister and herself , that she knew not what to expect to find him in his own family . She found him , however , perfectly the gentleman in his behaviour to all his visitors , and only occasionally rude to his wife and her mother ; she found him very capable of being a pleasant companion , and only prevented from being so always , by too great an aptitude to fancy himself as much superior to people in general , as he must feel himself to be to Mrs . Jennings and Charlotte .
austen#For the rest of his character and habits , they were marked , as far as Elinor could perceive , with no traits at all unusual in his sex and time of life . He was nice in his eating , uncertain in his hours ; fond of his child , though affecting to slight it ; and idled away the mornings at billiards , which ought to have been devoted to business . She liked him , however , upon the whole , much better than she had expected , and in her heart was not sorry that she could like him no more ;-- not sorry to be driven by the observation of his Epicurism , his selfishness , and his conceit , to rest with complacency on the remembrance of Edward ' s generous temper , simple taste , and diffident feelings . Of Edward , or at least of some of his concerns , she now received intelligence from Colonel Brandon , who had been into Dorsetshire lately ; and who , treating her at once as the disinterested friend of Mr . Ferrars , and the kind of confidant of himself , talked to her a great deal of the parsonage at Delaford , described its deficiencies , and told her what he meant to do himself towards removing them .-- His behaviour to her in this , as well as in every other particular , his open pleasure in meeting her after an absence of only ten days , his readiness to converse with her , and his deference for her opinion , might very well justify Mrs . Jennings ' s persuasion of his attachment , and would have been enough , perhaps , had not Elinor still , as from the first , believed Marianne his real favourite , to make her suspect it herself . But as it was , such a notion had scarcely ever entered her head , except by Mrs . Jennings ' s suggestion ; and she could not help believing herself the nicest observer of the two ;-- she watched his eyes , while Mrs . Jennings thought only of his behaviour ;-- and while his looks of anxious solicitude on Marianne ' s feeling , in her head and throat , the beginning of a heavy cold , because unexpressed by words , entirely escaped the latter lady ' s observation ;-- SHE could discover in them the quick feelings , and needless alarm of a lover . Two delighful twilight walks on the third and fourth evenings of her being there , not merely on the dry gravel of the shrubbery , but all over the grounds , and especially in the most distant parts of them , where there was something more of wildness than in the rest , where the trees were the oldest , and the grass was the longest and wettest , had -- assisted by the still greater imprudence of sitting in her wet shoes and stockings -- given Marianne a cold so violent as , though for a day or two trifled with or denied , would force itself by increasing ailments on the concern of every body , and the notice of herself .
austen#Prescriptions poured in from all quarters , and as usual , were all declined . Though heavy and feverish , with a pain in her limbs , and a cough , and a sore throat , a good night ' s rest was to cure her entirely ; and it was with difficulty that Elinor prevailed on her , when she went to bed , to try one or two of the simplest of the remedies . CHAPTER 43 Marianne got up the next morning at her usual time ; to every inquiry replied that she was better , and tried to prove herself so , by engaging in her accustomary employments . But a day spent in sitting shivering over the fire with a book in her hand , which she was unable to read , or in lying , weary and languid , on a sofa , did not speak much in favour of her amendment ; and when , at last , she went early to bed , more and more indisposed , Colonel Brandon was only astonished at her sister ' s composure , who , though attending and nursing her the whole day , against Marianne inclination , and forcing proper medicines on her at night , trusted , like Marianne , to the certainty and efficacy of sleep , and felt no real alarm . A very restless and feverish night , however , disappointed the expectation of both ; and when Marianne , after persisting in rising , confessed herself unable to sit up , and returned voluntarily to her bed , Elinor was very ready to adopt Mrs . Jennings ' s advice , of sending for the Palmers ' apothecary .
austen#"He came , examined his patient , and though encouraging Miss Dashwood to expect that a very few days would restore her sister to health , yet , by pronouncing her disorder to have a putrid tendency , and allowing the word "" infection "" to pass his lips , gave instant alarm to Mrs . Palmer , on her baby ' s account . Mrs . Jennings , who had been inclined from the first to think Marianne ' s complaint more serious than Elinor , now looked very grave on Mr . Harris ' s report , and confirming Charlotte ' s fears and caution , urged the necessity of her immediate removal with her infant ; and Mr . Palmer , though treating their apprehensions as idle , found the anxiety and importunity of his wife too great to be withstood . Her departure , therefore , was fixed on ; and within an hour after Mr . Harris ' s arrival , she set off , with her little boy and his nurse , for the house of a near relation of Mr . Palmer ' s , who lived a few miles on the other side of Bath ; whither her husband promised , at her earnest entreaty , to join her in a day or two ; and whither she was almost equally urgent with her mother to accompany her . Mrs . Jennings , however , with a kindness of heart which made Elinor really love her , declared her resolution of not stirring from Cleveland as long as Marianne remained ill , and of endeavouring , by her own attentive care , to supply to her the place of the mother she had taken her from ; and Elinor found her on every occasion a most willing and active helpmate , desirous to share in all her fatigues , and often by her better experience in nursing , of material use . Poor Marianne , languid and low from the nature of her malady , and feeling herself universally ill , could no longer hope that tomorrow would find her recovered ; and the idea of what tomorrow would have produced , but for this unlucky illness , made every ailment severe ; for on that day they were to have begun their journey home ; and , attended the whole way by a servant of Mrs . Jennings , were to have taken their mother by surprise on the following forenoon . The little she said was all in lamentation of this inevitable delay ; though Elinor tried to raise her spirits , and make her believe , as she THEN really believed herself , that it would be a very short one ."
austen#The next day produced little or no alteration in the state of the patient ; she certainly was not better , and , except that there was no amendment , did not appear worse . Their party was now farther reduced ; for Mr . Palmer , though very unwilling to go as well from real humanity and good - nature , as from a dislike of appearing to be frightened away by his wife , was persuaded at last by Colonel Brandon to perform his promise of following her ; and while he was preparing to go , Colonel Brandon himself , with a much greater exertion , began to talk of going likewise .-- Here , however , the kindness of Mrs . Jennings interposed most acceptably ; for to send the Colonel away while his love was in so much uneasiness on her sister ' s account , would be to deprive them both , she thought , of every comfort ; and therefore telling him at once that his stay at Cleveland was necessary to herself , that she should want him to play at piquet of an evening , while Miss Dashwood was above with her sister , & c . she urged him so strongly to remain , that he , who was gratifying the first wish of his own heart by a compliance , could not long even affect to demur ; especially as Mrs . Jennings ' s entreaty was warmly seconded by Mr . Palmer , who seemed to feel a relief to himself , in leaving behind him a person so well able to assist or advise Miss Dashwood in any emergence . Marianne was , of course , kept in ignorance of all these arrangements . She knew not that she had been the means of sending the owners of Cleveland away , in about seven days from the time of their arrival . It gave her no surprise that she saw nothing of Mrs . Palmer ; and as it gave her likewise no concern , she never mentioned her name . Two days passed away from the time of Mr . Palmer ' s departure , and her situation continued , with little variation , the same .
austen#Mr . Harris , who attended her every day , still talked boldly of a speedy recovery , and Miss Dashwood was equally sanguine ; but the expectation of the others was by no means so cheerful . Mrs . Jennings had determined very early in the seizure that Marianne would never get over it , and Colonel Brandon , who was chiefly of use in listening to Mrs . Jennings ' s forebodings , was not in a state of mind to resist their influence . He tried to reason himself out of fears , which the different judgment of the apothecary seemed to render absurd ; but the many hours of each day in which he was left entirely alone , were but too favourable for the admission of every melancholy idea , and he could not expel from his mind the persuasion that he should see Marianne no more . On the morning of the third day however , the gloomy anticipations of both were almost done away ; for when Mr . Harris arrived , he declared his patient materially better . Her pulse was much stronger , and every symptom more favourable than on the preceding visit . Elinor , confirmed in every pleasant hope , was all cheerfulness ; rejoicing that in her letters to her mother , she had pursued her own judgment rather than her friend ' s , in making very light of the indisposition which delayed them at Cleveland ; and almost fixing on the time when Marianne would be able to travel .
austen#"But the day did not close so auspiciously as it began .-- Towards the evening Marianne became ill again , growing more heavy , restless , and uncomfortable than before . Her sister , however , still sanguine , was willing to attribute the change to nothing more than the fatigue of having sat up to have her bed made ; and carefully administering the cordials prescribed , saw her , with satisfaction , sink at last into a slumber , from which she expected the most beneficial effects . Her sleep , though not so quiet as Elinor wished to see it , lasted a considerable time ; and anxious to observe the result of it herself , she resolved to sit with her during the whole of it . Mrs . Jennings , knowing nothing of any change in the patient , went unusually early to bed ; her maid , who was one of the principal nurses , was recreating herself in the housekeeper ' s room , and Elinor remained alone with Marianne . The repose of the latter became more and more disturbed ; and her sister , who watched , with unremitting attention her continual change of posture , and heard the frequent but inarticulate sounds of complaint which passed her lips , was almost wishing to rouse her from so painful a slumber , when Marianne , suddenly awakened by some accidental noise in the house , started hastily up , and , with feverish wildness , cried out ,-- "" Is mama coming ?--"""
austen#""" Not yet ,"" cried the other , concealing her terror , and assisting Marianne to lie down again , "" but she will be here , I hope , before it is long . It is a great way , you know , from hence to Barton ."" "" But she must not go round by London ,"" cried Marianne , in the same hurried manner . "" I shall never see her , if she goes by London ."" Elinor perceived with alarm that she was not quite herself , and , while attempting to soothe her , eagerly felt her pulse . It was lower and quicker than ever !"
austen#and Marianne , still talking wildly of mama , her alarm increased so rapidly , as to determine her on sending instantly for Mr . Harris , and despatching a messenger to Barton for her mother . To consult with Colonel Brandon on the best means of effecting the latter , was a thought which immediately followed the resolution of its performance ; and as soon she had rung up the maid to take her place by her sister , she hastened down to the drawing - room , where she knew he was generally to be found at a much later hour than the present . It was no time for hesitation . Her fears and her difficulties were immediately before him . Her fears , he had no courage , no confidence to attempt the removal of :-- he listened to them in silent despondence ;-- but her difficulties were instantly obviated , for with a readiness that seemed to speak the occasion , and the service pre - arranged in his mind , he offered himself as the messenger who should fetch Mrs . Dashwood . Elinor made no resistance that was not easily overcome .
austen#She thanked him with brief , though fervent gratitude , and while he went to hurry off his servant with a message to Mr . Harris , and an order for post - horses directly , she wrote a few lines to her mother . The comfort of such a friend at that moment as Colonel Brandon -- or such a companion for her mother ,-- how gratefully was it felt !-- a companion whose judgment would guide , whose attendance must relieve , and whose friendship might soothe her !-- as far as the shock of such a summons COULD be lessened to her , his presence , his manners , his assistance , would lessen it . HE , meanwhile , whatever he might feel , acted with all the firmness of a collected mind , made every necessary arrangement with the utmost despatch , and calculated with exactness the time in which she might look for his return . Not a moment was lost in delay of any kind . The horses arrived , even before they were expected , and Colonel Brandon only pressing her hand with a look of solemnity , and a few words spoken too low to reach her ear , hurried into the carriage . It was then about twelve o ' clock , and she returned to her sister ' s apartment to wait for the arrival of the apothecary , and to watch by her the rest of the night .
austen#It was a night of almost equal suffering to both . Hour after hour passed away in sleepless pain and delirium on Marianne ' s side , and in the most cruel anxiety on Elinor ' s , before Mr . Harris appeared . Her apprehensions once raised , paid by their excess for all her former security ; and the servant who sat up with her , for she would not allow Mrs . Jennings to be called , only tortured her more , by hints of what her mistress had always thought . Marianne ' s ideas were still , at intervals , fixed incoherently on her mother , and whenever she mentioned her name , it gave a pang to the heart of poor Elinor , who , reproaching herself for having trifled with so many days of illness , and wretched for some immediate relief , fancied that all relief might soon be in vain , that every thing had been delayed too long , and pictured to herself her suffering mother arriving too late to see this darling child , or to see her rational . She was on the point of sending again for Mr . Harris , or if HE could not come , for some other advice , when the former -- but not till after five o ' clock -- arrived . His opinion , however , made some little amends for his delay , for though acknowledging a very unexpected and unpleasant alteration in his patient , he would not allow the danger to be material , and talked of the relief which a fresh mode of treatment must procure , with a confidence which , in a lesser degree , was communicated to Elinor .
austen#He promised to call again in the course of three or four hours , and left both the patient and her anxious attendant more composed than he had found them . With strong concern , and with many reproaches for not being called to their aid , did Mrs . Jennings hear in the morning of what had passed . Her former apprehensions , now with greater reason restored , left her no doubt of the event ; and though trying to speak comfort to Elinor , her conviction of her sister ' s danger would not allow her to offer the comfort of hope . Her heart was really grieved . The rapid decay , the early death of a girl so young , so lovely as Marianne , must have struck a less interested person with concern . On Mrs . Jennings ' s compassion she had other claims .
austen#She had been for three months her companion , was still under her care , and she was known to have been greatly injured , and long unhappy . The distress of her sister too , particularly a favourite , was before her ;-- and as for their mother , when Mrs . Jennings considered that Marianne might probably be to HER what Charlotte was to herself , her sympathy in HER sufferings was very sincere . Mr . Harris was punctual in his second visit ;-- but he came to be disappointed in his hopes of what the last would produce . His medicines had failed ;-- the fever was unabated ; and Marianne only more quiet -- not more herself -- remained in a heavy stupor . Elinor , catching all , and more than all , his fears in a moment , proposed to call in further advice . But he judged it unnecessary : he had still something more to try , some more fresh application , of whose success he was as confident as the last , and his visit concluded with encouraging assurances which reached the ear , but could not enter the heart of Miss Dashwood .
austen#She was calm , except when she thought of her mother ; but she was almost hopeless ; and in this state she continued till noon , scarcely stirring from her sister ' s bed , her thoughts wandering from one image of grief , one suffering friend to another , and her spirits oppressed to the utmost by the conversation of Mrs . Jennings , who scrupled not to attribute the severity and danger of this attack to the many weeks of previous indisposition which Marianne ' s disappointment had brought on . Elinor felt all the reasonableness of the idea , and it gave fresh misery to her reflections . About noon , however , she began -- but with a caution -- a dread of disappointment which for some time kept her silent , even to her friend -- to fancy , to hope she could perceive a slight amendment in her sister ' s pulse ;-- she waited , watched , and examined it again and again ;-- and at last , with an agitation more difficult to bury under exterior calmness , than all her foregoing distress , ventured to communicate her hopes . Mrs . Jennings , though forced , on examination , to acknowledge a temporary revival , tried to keep her young friend from indulging a thought of its continuance ;-- and Elinor , conning over every injunction of distrust , told herself likewise not to hope . But it was too late . Hope had already entered ; and feeling all its anxious flutter , she bent over her sister to watch -- she hardly knew for what .
austen#Half an hour passed away , and the favourable symptom yet blessed her . Others even arose to confirm it . Her breath , her skin , her lips , all flattered Elinor with signs of amendment ; and Marianne fixed her eyes on her with a rational , though languid , gaze . Anxiety and hope now oppressed her in equal degrees , and left her no moment of tranquillity till the arrival of Mr . Harris at four o ' clock ;-- when his assurances , his felicitations on a recovery in her sister even surpassing his expectation , gave her confidence , comfort , and tears of joy . Marianne was in every respect materially better , and he declared her entirely out of danger . Mrs . Jennings , perhaps satisfied with the partial justification of her forebodings which had been found in their late alarm , allowed herself to trust in his judgment , and admitted , with unfeigned joy , and soon with unequivocal cheerfulness , the probability of an entire recovery .
austen#Elinor could not be cheerful . Her joy was of a different kind , and led to any thing rather than to gaiety . Marianne restored to life , health , friends , and to her doting mother , was an idea to fill her heart with sensations of exquisite comfort , and expand it in fervent gratitude ;-- but it lead to no outward demonstrations of joy , no words , no smiles . All within Elinor ' s breast was satisfaction , silent and strong . She continued by the side of her sister , with little intermission the whole afternoon , calming every fear , satisfying every inquiry of her enfeebled spirits , supplying every succour , and watching almost every look and every breath . The possibility of a relapse would of course , in some moments , occur to remind her of what anxiety was -- but when she saw , on her frequent and minute examination , that every symptom of recovery continued , and saw Marianne at six o ' clock sink into a quiet , steady , and to all appearance comfortable , sleep , she silenced every doubt .
austen#The time was now drawing on , when Colonel Brandon might be expected back . At ten o ' clock , she trusted , or at least not much later her mother would be relieved from the dreadful suspense in which she must now be travelling towards them . The Colonel , too !-- perhaps scarcely less an object of pity !-- Oh !-- how slow was the progress of time which yet kept them in ignorance ! At seven o ' clock , leaving Marianne still sweetly asleep , she joined Mrs . Jennings in the drawing - room to tea . Of breakfast she had been kept by her fears , and of dinner by their sudden reverse , from eating much ;-- and the present refreshment , therefore , with such feelings of content as she brought to it , was particularly welcome . Mrs . Jennings would have persuaded her , at its conclusion , to take some rest before her mother ' s arrival , and allow HER to take her place by Marianne ; but Elinor had no sense of fatigue , no capability of sleep at that moment about her , and she was not to be kept away from her sister an unnecessary instant .
austen#Mrs . Jennings therefore attending her up stairs into the sick chamber , to satisfy herself that all continued right , left her there again to her charge and her thoughts , and retired to her own room to write letters and sleep . The night was cold and stormy . The wind roared round the house , and the rain beat against the windows ; but Elinor , all happiness within , regarded it not . Marianne slept through every blast ; and the travellers -- they had a rich reward in store , for every present inconvenience . The clock struck eight . Had it been ten , Elinor would have been convinced that at that moment she heard a carriage driving up to the house ; and so strong was the persuasion that she DID , in spite of the ALMOST impossibility of their being already come , that she moved into the adjoining dressing - closet and opened a window shutter , to be satisfied of the truth .
austen#She instantly saw that her ears had not deceived her . The flaring lamps of a carriage were immediately in view . By their uncertain light she thought she could discern it to be drawn by four horses ; and this , while it told the excess of her poor mother ' s alarm , gave some explanation to such unexpected rapidity . Never in her life had Elinor found it so difficult to be calm , as at that moment . The knowledge of what her mother must be feeling as the carriage stopt at the door -- of her doubt -- her dread -- perhaps her despair !-- and of what SHE had to tell !-- with such knowledge it was impossible to be calm . All that remained to be done was to be speedy ; and , therefore staying only till she could leave Mrs . Jennings ' s maid with her sister , she hurried down stairs .
austen#"The bustle in the vestibule , as she passed along an inner lobby , assured her that they were already in the house . She rushed to the drawing - room ,-- she entered it ,-- and saw only Willoughby . CHAPTER 44 Elinor , starting back with a look of horror at the sight of him , obeyed the first impulse of her heart in turning instantly to quit the room , and her hand was already on the lock , when its action was suspended by his hastily advancing , and saying , in a voice rather of command than supplication , "" Miss Dashwood , for half an hour -- for ten minutes -- I entreat you to stay ."" "" No , sir ,"" she replied with firmness , "" I shall NOT stay ."
austen#"Your business cannot be with ME . The servants , I suppose , forgot to tell you that Mr . Palmer was not in the house ."" "" Had they told me ,"" he cried with vehemence , "" that Mr . Palmer and all his relations were at the devil , it would not have turned me from the door . My business is with you , and only you ."" "" With me !"" -- in the utmost amazement --"" well , sir ,-- be quick -- and if you can -- less violent ."""
austen#""" Sit down , and I will be both ."" She hesitated ; she knew not what to do . The possibility of Colonel Brandon ' s arriving and finding her there , came across her . But she had promised to hear him , and her curiosity no less than her honor was engaged . After a moment ' s recollection , therefore , concluding that prudence required dispatch , and that her acquiescence would best promote it , she walked silently towards the table , and sat down . He took the opposite chair , and for half a minute not a word was said by either ."
austen#""" Pray be quick , sir ,""-- said Elinor , impatiently ;-- "" I have no time to spare ."" He was sitting in an attitude of deep meditation , and seemed not to hear her . "" Your sister ,"" said he , with abruptness , a moment afterwards --"" is out of danger . I heard it from the servant . God be praised !-- But is it true ? is it really true ?"""
austen#"Elinor would not speak . He repeated the inquiry with yet greater eagerness . "" For God ' s sake tell me , is she out of danger , or is she not ?"" "" We hope she is ."" He rose up , and walked across the room . "" Had I known as much half an hour ago -- But since I AM here ,""-- speaking with a forced vivacity as he returned to his seat --"" what does it signify ?-- For once , Miss Dashwood -- it will be the last time , perhaps -- let us be cheerful together .-- I am in a fine mood for gaiety .-- Tell me honestly ""-- a deeper glow overspreading his cheeks -- "" do you think me most a knave or a fool ?"""
austen#"Elinor looked at him with greater astonishment than ever . She began to think that be must be in liquor ;-- the strangeness of such a visit , and of such manners , seemed no otherwise intelligible ; and with this impression she immediately rose , saying , "" Mr . Willoughby , I advise you at present to return to Combe -- I am not at leisure to remain with you longer .-- Whatever your business may be with me , will it be better recollected and explained to - morrow ."" "" I understand you ,"" he replied , with an expressive smile , and a voice perfectly calm ; "" yes , I am very drunk .-- A pint of porter with my cold beef at Marlborough was enough to over - set me ."" "" At Marlborough !"" -- cried Elinor , more and more at a loss to understand what he would be at ."
austen#""" Yes ,-- I left London this morning at eight o ' clock , and the only ten minutes I have spent out of my chaise since that time procured me a nuncheon at Marlborough ."" The steadiness of his manner , and the intelligence of his eye as he spoke , convincing Elinor , that whatever other unpardonable folly might bring him to Cleveland , he was not brought there by intoxication , she said , after a moment ' s recollection , "" Mr . Willoughby , you OUGHT to feel , and I certainly DO -- that after what has passed -- your coming here in this manner , and forcing yourself upon my notice , requires a very particular excuse .-- What is it , that you mean by it ?"" -- "" I mean ,""-- said he , with serious energy --"" if I can , to make you hate me one degree less than you do NOW . I mean to offer some kind of explanation , some kind of apology , for the past ; to open my whole heart to you , and by convincing you , that though I have been always a blockhead , I have not been always a rascal , to obtain something like forgiveness from Ma -- from your sister ."""
austen#""" Is this the real reason of your coming ?"" "" Upon my soul it is ,""-- was his answer , with a warmth which brought all the former Willoughby to her remembrance , and in spite of herself made her think him sincere . "" If that is all , you may be satisfied already ,-- for Marianne DOES -- she has LONG forgiven you ."" "" Has she ?"" -- he cried , in the same eager tone .-- "" Then she has forgiven me before she ought to have done it . But she shall forgive me again , and on more reasonable grounds .-- NOW will you listen to me ?"""
austen#"Elinor bowed her assent . "" I do not know ,"" said he , after a pause of expectation on her side , and thoughtfulness on his own ,--"" how YOU may have accounted for my behaviour to your sister , or what diabolical motive you may have imputed to me .-- Perhaps you will hardly think the better of me ,-- it is worth the trial however , and you shall hear every thing . When I first became intimate in your family , I had no other intention , no other view in the acquaintance than to pass my time pleasantly while I was obliged to remain in Devonshire , more pleasantly than I had ever done before . Your sister ' s lovely person and interesting manners could not but please me ; and her behaviour to me almost from the first , was of a kind -- It is astonishing , when I reflect on what it was , and what SHE was , that my heart should have been so insensible ! But at first I must confess , my vanity only was elevated by it . Careless of her happiness , thinking only of my own amusement , giving way to feelings which I had always been too much in the habit of indulging , I endeavoured , by every means in my power , to make myself pleasing to her , without any design of returning her affection ."""
austen#"Miss Dashwood , at this point , turning her eyes on him with the most angry contempt , stopped him , by saying , "" It is hardly worth while , Mr . Willoughby , for you to relate , or for me to listen any longer . Such a beginning as this cannot be followed by any thing .-- Do not let me be pained by hearing any thing more on the subject ."" "" I insist on you hearing the whole of it ,"" he replied , "" My fortune was never large , and I had always been expensive , always in the habit of associating with people of better income than myself . Every year since my coming of age , or even before , I believe , had added to my debts ; and though the death of my old cousin , Mrs . Smith , was to set me free ; yet that event being uncertain , and possibly far distant , it had been for some time my intention to re - establish my circumstances by marrying a woman of fortune . To attach myself to your sister , therefore , was not a thing to be thought of ;-- and with a meanness , selfishness , cruelty -- which no indignant , no contemptuous look , even of yours , Miss Dashwood , can ever reprobate too much -- I was acting in this manner , trying to engage her regard , without a thought of returning it .-- But one thing may be said for me : even in that horrid state of selfish vanity , I did not know the extent of the injury I meditated , because I did not THEN know what it was to love ."
austen#"But have I ever known it ?-- Well may it be doubted ; for , had I really loved , could I have sacrificed my feelings to vanity , to avarice ?-- or , what is more , could I have sacrificed hers ?-- But I have done it . To avoid a comparative poverty , which her affection and her society would have deprived of all its horrors , I have , by raising myself to affluence , lost every thing that could make it a blessing ."" "" You did then ,"" said Elinor , a little softened , "" believe yourself at one time attached to her ?"" "" To have resisted such attractions , to have withstood such tenderness !-- Is there a man on earth who could have done it ?-- Yes , I found myself , by insensible degrees , sincerely fond of her ; and the happiest hours of my life were what I spent with her when I felt my intentions were strictly honourable , and my feelings blameless . Even THEN , however , when fully determined on paying my addresses to her , I allowed myself most improperly to put off , from day to day , the moment of doing it , from an unwillingness to enter into an engagement while my circumstances were so greatly embarrassed . I will not reason here -- nor will I stop for YOU to expatiate on the absurdity , and the worse than absurdity , of scrupling to engage my faith where my honour was already bound ."
austen#"The event has proved , that I was a cunning fool , providing with great circumspection for a possible opportunity of making myself contemptible and wretched for ever . At last , however , my resolution was taken , and I had determined , as soon as I could engage her alone , to justify the attentions I had so invariably paid her , and openly assure her of an affection which I had already taken such pains to display . But in the interim -- in the interim of the very few hours that were to pass , before I could have an opportunity of speaking with her in private -- a circumstance occurred -- an unlucky circumstance , to ruin all my resolution , and with it all my comfort . A discovery took place ,""-- here he hesitated and looked down .--"" Mrs . Smith had somehow or other been informed , I imagine by some distant relation , whose interest it was to deprive me of her favour , of an affair , a connection -- but I need not explain myself farther ,"" he added , looking at her with an heightened colour and an enquiring eye --"" your particular intimacy -- you have probably heard the whole story long ago ."" "" I have ,"" returned Elinor , colouring likewise , and hardening her heart anew against any compassion for him , "" I have heard it all ."
austen#"And how you will explain away any part of your guilt in that dreadful business , I confess is beyond my comprehension ."" "" Remember ,"" cried Willoughby , "" from whom you received the account . Could it be an impartial one ? I acknowledge that her situation and her character ought to have been respected by me . I do not mean to justify myself , but at the same time cannot leave you to suppose that I have nothing to urge -- that because she was injured she was irreproachable , and because I was a libertine , SHE must be a saint . If the violence of her passions , the weakness of her understanding -- I do not mean , however , to defend myself ."
austen#"Her affection for me deserved better treatment , and I often , with great self - reproach , recall the tenderness which , for a very short time , had the power of creating any return . I wish -- I heartily wish it had never been . But I have injured more than herself ; and I have injured one , whose affection for me --( may I say it ?) was scarcely less warm than hers ; and whose mind -- Oh ! how infinitely superior !"" --"
austen#""" Your indifference , however , towards that unfortunate girl -- I must say it , unpleasant to me as the discussion of such a subject may well be -- your indifference is no apology for your cruel neglect of her . Do not think yourself excused by any weakness , any natural defect of understanding on her side , in the wanton cruelty so evident on yours . You must have known , that while you were enjoying yourself in Devonshire pursuing fresh schemes , always gay , always happy , she was reduced to the extremest indigence ."" "" But , upon my soul , I did NOT know it ,"" he warmly replied ; "" I did not recollect that I had omitted to give her my direction ; and common sense might have told her how to find it out ."" "" Well , sir , and what said Mrs . Smith ?"""
austen#""" She taxed me with the offence at once , and my confusion may be guessed . The purity of her life , the formality of her notions , her ignorance of the world -- every thing was against me . The matter itself I could not deny , and vain was every endeavour to soften it . She was previously disposed , I believe , to doubt the morality of my conduct in general , and was moreover discontented with the very little attention , the very little portion of my time that I had bestowed on her , in my present visit . In short , it ended in a total breach . By one measure I might have saved myself ."
austen#In the height of her morality , good woman ! she offered to forgive the past , if I would marry Eliza . That could not be -- and I was formally dismissed from her favour and her house . The night following this affair -- I was to go the next morning -- was spent by me in deliberating on what my future conduct should be . The struggle was great -- but it ended too soon . My affection for Marianne , my thorough conviction of her attachment to me -- it was all insufficient to outweigh that dread of poverty , or get the better of those false ideas of the necessity of riches , which I was naturally inclined to feel , and expensive society had increased .
austen#"I had reason to believe myself secure of my present wife , if I chose to address her , and I persuaded myself to think that nothing else in common prudence remained for me to do . A heavy scene however awaited me , before I could leave Devonshire ;-- I was engaged to dine with you on that very day ; some apology was therefore necessary for my breaking this engagement . But whether I should write this apology , or deliver it in person , was a point of long debate . To see Marianne , I felt , would be dreadful , and I even doubted whether I could see her again , and keep to my resolution . In that point , however , I undervalued my own magnanimity , as the event declared ; for I went , I saw her , and saw her miserable , and left her miserable -- and left her hoping never to see her again ."" "" Why did you call , Mr ."
austen#"Willoughby ?"" said Elinor , reproachfully ; "" a note would have answered every purpose .-- Why was it necessary to call ?"" "" It was necessary to my own pride . I could not bear to leave the country in a manner that might lead you , or the rest of the neighbourhood , to suspect any part of what had really passed between Mrs . Smith and myself -- and I resolved therefore on calling at the cottage , in my way to Honiton . The sight of your dear sister , however , was really dreadful ; and , to heighten the matter , I found her alone . You were all gone I do not know where ."
austen#"I had left her only the evening before , so fully , so firmly resolved within my self on doing right ! A few hours were to have engaged her to me for ever ; and I remember how happy , how gay were my spirits , as I walked from the cottage to Allenham , satisfied with myself , delighted with every body ! But in this , our last interview of friendship , I approached her with a sense of guilt that almost took from me the power of dissembling . Her sorrow , her disappointment , her deep regret , when I told her that I was obliged to leave Devonshire so immediately -- I never shall forget it -- united too with such reliance , such confidence in me !-- Oh , God !-- what a hard - hearted rascal I was !"" They were both silent for a few moments . Elinor first spoke ."
austen#""" Did you tell her that you should soon return ?"" "" I do not know what I told her ,"" he replied , impatiently ; "" less than was due to the past , beyond a doubt , and in all likelihood much more than was justified by the future . I cannot think of it .-- It won ' t do .-- Then came your dear mother to torture me farther , with all her kindness and confidence . Thank Heaven ! it DID torture me . I was miserable ."
austen#"Miss Dashwood , you cannot have an idea of the comfort it gives me to look back on my own misery . I owe such a grudge to myself for the stupid , rascally folly of my own heart , that all my past sufferings under it are only triumph and exultation to me now . Well , I went , left all that I loved , and went to those to whom , at best , I was only indifferent . My journey to town -- travelling with my own horses , and therefore so tediously -- no creature to speak to -- my own reflections so cheerful -- when I looked forward every thing so inviting !-- when I looked back at Barton , the picture so soothing !-- oh , it was a blessed journey !"" He stopped . "" Well , sir ,"" said Elinor , who , though pitying him , grew impatient for his departure , "" and this is all ?"""
austen#""" Ah !-- no ,-- have you forgot what passed in town ?-- That infamous letter -- Did she shew it you ?"" "" Yes , I saw every note that passed ."" "" When the first of hers reached me ( as it immediately did , for I was in town the whole time ,) what I felt is -- in the common phrase , not to be expressed ; in a more simple one -- perhaps too simple to raise any emotion -- my feelings were very , very painful .-- Every line , every word was -- in the hackneyed metaphor which their dear writer , were she here , would forbid -- a dagger to my heart . To know that Marianne was in town was -- in the same language -- a thunderbolt .-- Thunderbolts and daggers !-- what a reproof would she have given me !-- her taste , her opinions -- I believe they are better known to me than my own ,-- and I am sure they are dearer ."" Elinor ' s heart , which had undergone many changes in the course of this extraordinary conversation , was now softened again ;-- yet she felt it her duty to check such ideas in her companion as the last . "" This is not right , Mr ."
austen#"Willoughby .-- Remember that you are married . Relate only what in your conscience you think necessary for me to hear ."" "" Marianne ' s note , by assuring me that I was still as dear to her as in former days , that in spite of the many , many weeks we had been separated , she was as constant in her own feelings , and as full of faith in the constancy of mine as ever , awakened all my remorse . I say awakened , because time and London , business and dissipation , had in some measure quieted it , and I had been growing a fine hardened villain , fancying myself indifferent to her , and chusing to fancy that she too must have become indifferent to me ; talking to myself of our past attachment as a mere idle , trifling business , shrugging up my shoulders in proof of its being so , and silencing every reproach , overcoming every scruple , by secretly saying now and then , ' I shall be heartily glad to hear she is well married .' -- But this note made me know myself better . I felt that she was infinitely dearer to me than any other woman in the world , and that I was using her infamously ."
austen#"But every thing was then just settled between Miss Grey and me . To retreat was impossible . All that I had to do , was to avoid you both . I sent no answer to Marianne , intending by that to preserve myself from her farther notice ; and for some time I was even determined not to call in Berkeley Street ;-- but at last , judging it wiser to affect the air of a cool , common acquaintance than anything else , I watched you all safely out of the house one morning , and left my name ."" "" Watched us out of the house !"" "" Even so ."
austen#You would be surprised to hear how often I watched you , how often I was on the point of falling in with you . I have entered many a shop to avoid your sight , as the carriage drove by . Lodging as I did in Bond Street , there was hardly a day in which I did not catch a glimpse of one or other of you ; and nothing but the most constant watchfulness on my side , a most invariably prevailing desire to keep out of your sight , could have separated us so long . I avoided the Middletons as much as possible , as well as everybody else who was likely to prove an acquaintance in common . Not aware of their being in town , however , I blundered on Sir John , I believe , the first day of his coming , and the day after I had called at Mrs . Jennings ' s . He asked me to a party , a dance at his house in the evening .-- Had he NOT told me as an inducement that you and your sister were to be there , I should have felt it too certain a thing , to trust myself near him .
austen#The next morning brought another short note from Marianne -- still affectionate , open , artless , confiding -- everything that could make MY conduct most hateful . I could not answer it . I tried -- but could not frame a sentence . But I thought of her , I believe , every moment of the day . If you CAN pity me , Miss Dashwood , pity my situation as it was THEN . With my head and heart full of your sister , I was forced to play the happy lover to another woman !-- Those three or four weeks were worse than all .
austen#"Well , at last , as I need not tell you , you were forced on me ; and what a sweet figure I cut !-- what an evening of agony it was !-- Marianne , beautiful as an angel on one side , calling me Willoughby in such a tone !-- Oh , God !-- holding out her hand to me , asking me for an explanation , with those bewitching eyes fixed in such speaking solicitude on my face !-- and Sophia , jealous as the devil on the other hand , looking all that was -- Well , it does not signify ; it is over now .-- Such an evening !-- I ran away from you all as soon as I could ; but not before I had seen Marianne ' s sweet face as white as death .-- THAT was the last , last look I ever had of her ;-- the last manner in which she appeared to me . It was a horrid sight !-- yet when I thought of her to - day as really dying , it was a kind of comfort to me to imagine that I knew exactly how she would appear to those , who saw her last in this world . She was before me , constantly before me , as I travelled , in the same look and hue ."" A short pause of mutual thoughtfulness succeeded . Willoughby first rousing himself , broke it thus : "" Well , let me make haste and be gone ."
austen#"Your sister is certainly better , certainly out of danger ?"" "" We are assured of it ."" "" Your poor mother , too !-- doting on Marianne ."" "" But the letter , Mr . Willoughby , your own letter ; have you any thing to say about that ?"" "" Yes , yes , THAT in particular . Your sister wrote to me again , you know , the very next morning ."
austen#You saw what she said . I was breakfasting at the Ellisons ,-- and her letter , with some others , was brought to me there from my lodgings . It happened to catch Sophia ' s eye before it caught mine -- and its size , the elegance of the paper , the hand - writing altogether , immediately gave her a suspicion . Some vague report had reached her before of my attachment to some young lady in Devonshire , and what had passed within her observation the preceding evening had marked who the young lady was , and made her more jealous than ever . Affecting that air of playfulness , therefore , which is delightful in a woman one loves , she opened the letter directly , and read its contents . She was well paid for her impudence .
austen#"She read what made her wretched . Her wretchedness I could have borne , but her passion -- her malice -- At all events it must be appeased . And , in short -- what do you think of my wife ' s style of letter - writing ?-- delicate -- tender -- truly feminine -- was it not ?"" "" Your wife !-- The letter was in your own hand - writing ."" "" Yes , but I had only the credit of servilely copying such sentences as I was ashamed to put my name to . The original was all her own -- her own happy thoughts and gentle diction ."
austen#But what could I do !-- we were engaged , every thing in preparation , the day almost fixed -- But I am talking like a fool . Preparation !-- day !-- In honest words , her money was necessary to me , and in a situation like mine , any thing was to be done to prevent a rupture . And after all , what did it signify to my character in the opinion of Marianne and her friends , in what language my answer was couched ?-- It must have been only to one end . My business was to declare myself a scoundrel , and whether I did it with a bow or a bluster was of little importance .-- ' I am ruined for ever in their opinion --' said I to myself --' I am shut out for ever from their society , they already think me an unprincipled fellow , this letter will only make them think me a blackguard one .' Such were my reasonings , as , in a sort of desperate carelessness , I copied my wife ' s words , and parted with the last relics of Marianne . Her three notes -- unluckily they were all in my pocketbook , or I should have denied their existence , and hoarded them for ever -- I was forced to put them up , and could not even kiss them .
austen#"And the lock of hair -- that too I had always carried about me in the same pocket - book , which was now searched by Madam with the most ingratiating virulence ,-- the dear lock -- all , every memento was torn from me ."" "" You are very wrong , Mr . Willoughby , very blamable ,"" said Elinor , while her voice , in spite of herself , betrayed her compassionate emotion ; "" you ought not to speak in this way , either of Mrs . Willoughby or my sister . You had made your own choice . It was not forced on you . Your wife has a claim to your politeness , to your respect , at least . She must be attached to you , or she would not have married you ."
austen#"To treat her with unkindness , to speak of her slightingly is no atonement to Marianne -- nor can I suppose it a relief to your own conscience ."" "" Do not talk to me of my wife ,"" said he with a heavy sigh .-- "" She does not deserve your compassion .-- She knew I had no regard for her when we married .-- Well , married we were , and came down to Combe Magna to be happy , and afterwards returned to town to be gay .-- And now do you pity me , Miss Dashwood ?-- or have I said all this to no purpose ?-- Am I -- be it only one degree -- am I less guilty in your opinion than I was before ?-- My intentions were not always wrong . Have I explained away any part of my guilt ?"" "" Yes , you have certainly removed something -- a little .-- You have proved yourself , on the whole , less faulty than I had believed you . You have proved your heart less wicked , much less wicked . But I hardly know -- the misery that you have inflicted -- I hardly know what could have made it worse ."""
austen#""" Will you repeat to your sister when she is recovered , what I have been telling you ?-- Let me be a little lightened too in her opinion as well as in yours . You tell me that she has forgiven me already . Let me be able to fancy that a better knowledge of my heart , and of my present feelings , will draw from her a more spontaneous , more natural , more gentle , less dignified , forgiveness . Tell her of my misery and my penitence -- tell her that my heart was never inconstant to her , and if you will , that at this moment she is dearer to me than ever ."" "" I will tell her all that is necessary to what may comparatively be called , your justification . But you have not explained to me the particular reason of your coming now , nor how you heard of her illness ."""
austen#""" Last night , in Drury Lane lobby , I ran against Sir John Middleton , and when he saw who I was -- for the first time these two months -- he spoke to me .-- That he had cut me ever since my marriage , I had seen without surprise or resentment . Now , however , his good - natured , honest , stupid soul , full of indignation against me , and concern for your sister , could not resist the temptation of telling me what he knew ought to -- though probably he did not think it WOULD -- vex me horridly . As bluntly as he could speak it , therefore , he told me that Marianne Dashwood was dying of a putrid fever at Cleveland -- a letter that morning received from Mrs . Jennings declared her danger most imminent -- the Palmers are all gone off in a fright , & c .-- I was too much shocked to be able to pass myself off as insensible even to the undiscerning Sir John . His heart was softened in seeing mine suffer ; and so much of his ill - will was done away , that when we parted , he almost shook me by the hand while he reminded me of an old promise about a pointer puppy . What I felt on hearing that your sister was dying -- and dying too , believing me the greatest villain upon earth , scorning , hating me in her latest moments -- for how could I tell what horrid projects might not have been imputed ? ONE person I was sure would represent me as capable of any thing -- What I felt was dreadful !-- My resolution was soon made , and at eight o ' clock this morning I was in my carriage ."
austen#"Now you know all ."" Elinor made no answer . Her thoughts were silently fixed on the irreparable injury which too early an independence and its consequent habits of idleness , dissipation , and luxury , had made in the mind , the character , the happiness , of a man who , to every advantage of person and talents , united a disposition naturally open and honest , and a feeling , affectionate temper . The world had made him extravagant and vain -- Extravagance and vanity had made him cold - hearted and selfish . Vanity , while seeking its own guilty triumph at the expense of another , had involved him in a real attachment , which extravagance , or at least its offspring , necessity , had required to be sacrificed . Each faulty propensity in leading him to evil , had led him likewise to punishment ."
austen#"The attachment , from which against honour , against feeling , against every better interest he had outwardly torn himself , now , when no longer allowable , governed every thought ; and the connection , for the sake of which he had , with little scruple , left her sister to misery , was likely to prove a source of unhappiness to himself of a far more incurable nature . From a reverie of this kind she was recalled at the end of some minutes by Willoughby , who , rousing himself from a reverie at least equally painful , started up in preparation for going , and said -- "" There is no use in staying here ; I must be off ."" "" Are you going back to town ?"" "" No -- to Combe Magna . I have business there ; from thence to town in a day or two ."
austen#"Good bye ."" He held out his hand . She could not refuse to give him hers ' s ;-- he pressed it with affection . "" And you DO think something better of me than you did ?"" -- said he , letting it fall , and leaning against the mantel - piece as if forgetting he was to go . Elinor assured him that she did ;-- that she forgave , pitied , wished him well -- was even interested in his happiness -- and added some gentle counsel as to the behaviour most likely to promote it ."
austen#"His answer was not very encouraging . "" As to that ,"" said he , "" I must rub through the world as well as I can . Domestic happiness is out of the question . If , however , I am allowed to think that you and yours feel an interest in my fate and actions , it may be the means -- it may put me on my guard -- at least , it may be something to live for . Marianne to be sure is lost to me for ever . Were I even by any blessed chance at liberty again --"""
austen#"Elinor stopped him with a reproof . "" Well ,""-- he replied --"" once more good bye . I shall now go away and live in dread of one event ."" "" What do you mean ?"" "" Your sister ' s marriage ."" "" You are very wrong ."
austen#"She can never be more lost to you than she is now ."" "" But she will be gained by some one else . And if that some one should be the very he whom , of all others , I could least bear -- but I will not stay to rob myself of all your compassionate goodwill , by shewing that where I have most injured I can least forgive . Good bye ,-- God bless you !"" And with these words , he almost ran out of the room . CHAPTER 45"
austen#Elinor , for some time after he left her , for some time even after the sound of his carriage had died away , remained too much oppressed by a crowd of ideas , widely differing in themselves , but of which sadness was the general result , to think even of her sister . Willoughby , he , whom only half an hour ago she had abhorred as the most worthless of men , Willoughby , in spite of all his faults , excited a degree of commiseration for the sufferings produced by them , which made her think of him as now separated for ever from her family , with a tenderness , a regret , rather in proportion , as she soon acknowledged within herself -- to his wishes than to his merits . She felt that his influence over her mind was heightened by circumstances which ought not in reason to have weight ; by that person of uncommon attraction , that open , affectionate , and lively manner which it was no merit to possess ; and by that still ardent love for Marianne , which it was not even innocent to indulge . But she felt that it was so , long , long before she could feel his influence less . When at last she returned to the unconscious Marianne , she found her just awaking , refreshed by so long and sweet a sleep to the extent of her hopes . Elinor ' s heart was full .
austen#The past , the present , the future , Willoughby ' s visit , Marianne ' s safety , and her mother ' s expected arrival , threw her altogether into an agitation of spirits which kept off every indication of fatigue , and made her only fearful of betraying herself to her sister . Short was the time , however , in which that fear could affect her , for within half an hour after Willoughby ' s leaving the house , she was again called down stairs by the sound of another carriage .-- Eager to save her mother from every unnecessary moment ' s horrible suspense , she ran immediately into the hall , and reached the outward door just in time to receive and support her as she entered it . Mrs . Dashwood , whose terror as they drew near the house had produced almost the conviction of Marianne ' s being no more , had no voice to inquire after her , no voice even for Elinor ; but SHE , waiting neither for salutation nor inquiry , instantly gave the joyful relief ;-- and her mother , catching it with all her usual warmth , was in a moment as much overcome by her happiness , as she had been before by her fears . She was supported into the drawing - room between her daughter and her friend ;-- and there , shedding tears of joy , though still unable to speak , embraced Elinor again and again , turning from her at intervals to press Colonel Brandon ' s hand , with a look which spoke at once her gratitude , and her conviction of his sharing with herself in the bliss of the moment . He shared it , however , in a silence even greater than her own . As soon as Mrs . Dashwood had recovered herself , to see Marianne was her first desire ; and in two minutes she was with her beloved child , rendered dearer to her than ever by absence , unhappiness , and danger .
austen#"Elinor ' s delight , as she saw what each felt in the meeting , was only checked by an apprehension of its robbing Marianne of farther sleep ;-- but Mrs . Dashwood could be calm , could be even prudent , when the life of a child was at stake , and Marianne , satisfied in knowing her mother was near her , and conscious of being too weak for conversation , submitted readily to the silence and quiet prescribed by every nurse around her . Mrs . Dashwood WOULD sit up with her all night ; and Elinor , in compliance with her mother ' s entreaty , went to bed . But the rest , which one night entirely sleepless , and many hours of the most wearing anxiety seemed to make requisite , was kept off by irritation of spirits . Willoughby , "" poor Willoughby ,"" as she now allowed herself to call him , was constantly in her thoughts ; she would not but have heard his vindication for the world , and now blamed , now acquitted herself for having judged him so harshly before . But her promise of relating it to her sister was invariably painful . She dreaded the performance of it , dreaded what its effect on Marianne might be ; doubted whether after such an explanation she could ever be happy with another ; and for a moment wished Willoughby a widower ."
austen#Then , remembering Colonel Brandon , reproved herself , felt that to HIS sufferings and his constancy far more than to his rival ' s , the reward of her sister was due , and wished any thing rather than Mrs . Willoughby ' s death . The shock of Colonel Brandon ' s errand at Barton had been much softened to Mrs . Dashwood by her own previous alarm ; for so great was her uneasiness about Marianne , that she had already determined to set out for Cleveland on that very day , without waiting for any further intelligence , and had so far settled her journey before his arrival , that the Careys were then expected every moment to fetch Margaret away , as her mother was unwilling to take her where there might be infection . Marianne continued to mend every day , and the brilliant cheerfulness of Mrs . Dashwood ' s looks and spirits proved her to be , as she repeatedly declared herself , one of the happiest women in the world . Elinor could not hear the declaration , nor witness its proofs without sometimes wondering whether her mother ever recollected Edward . But Mrs . Dashwood , trusting to the temperate account of her own disappointment which Elinor had sent her , was led away by the exuberance of her joy to think only of what would increase it . Marianne was restored to her from a danger in which , as she now began to feel , her own mistaken judgment in encouraging the unfortunate attachment to Willoughby , had contributed to place her ;-- and in her recovery she had yet another source of joy unthought of by Elinor .
austen#"It was thus imparted to her , as soon as any opportunity of private conference between them occurred . "" At last we are alone . My Elinor , you do not yet know all my happiness . Colonel Brandon loves Marianne . He has told me so himself ."" Her daughter , feeling by turns both pleased and pained , surprised and not surprised , was all silent attention ."
austen#""" You are never like me , dear Elinor , or I should wonder at your composure now . Had I sat down to wish for any possible good to my family , I should have fixed on Colonel Brandon ' s marrying one of you as the object most desirable . And I believe Marianne will be the most happy with him of the two ."" Elinor was half inclined to ask her reason for thinking so , because satisfied that none founded on an impartial consideration of their age , characters , or feelings , could be given ;-- but her mother must always be carried away by her imagination on any interesting subject , and therefore instead of an inquiry , she passed it off with a smile . "" He opened his whole heart to me yesterday as we travelled . It came out quite unawares , quite undesignedly ."
austen#"I , you may well believe , could talk of nothing but my child ;-- he could not conceal his distress ; I saw that it equalled my own , and he perhaps , thinking that mere friendship , as the world now goes , would not justify so warm a sympathy -- or rather , not thinking at all , I suppose -- giving way to irresistible feelings , made me acquainted with his earnest , tender , constant , affection for Marianne . He has loved her , my Elinor , ever since the first moment of seeing her ."" Here , however , Elinor perceived ,-- not the language , not the professions of Colonel Brandon , but the natural embellishments of her mother ' s active fancy , which fashioned every thing delightful to her as it chose . "" His regard for her , infinitely surpassing anything that Willoughby ever felt or feigned , as much more warm , as more sincere or constant -- which ever we are to call it -- has subsisted through all the knowledge of dear Marianne ' s unhappy prepossession for that worthless young man !-- and without selfishness -- without encouraging a hope !-- could he have seen her happy with another -- Such a noble mind !-- such openness , such sincerity !-- no one can be deceived in HIM ."" "" Colonel Brandon ' s character ,"" said Elinor , "" as an excellent man , is well established ."" "" I know it is ""-- replied her mother seriously , "" or after such a warning , I should be the last to encourage such affection , or even to be pleased by it ."
austen#"But his coming for me as he did , with such active , such ready friendship , is enough to prove him one of the worthiest of men ."" "" His character , however ,"" answered Elinor , "" does not rest on ONE act of kindness , to which his affection for Marianne , were humanity out of the case , would have prompted him . To Mrs . Jennings , to the Middletons , he has been long and intimately known ; they equally love and respect him ; and even my own knowledge of him , though lately acquired , is very considerable ; and so highly do I value and esteem him , that if Marianne can be happy with him , I shall be as ready as yourself to think our connection the greatest blessing to us in the world . What answer did you give him ?-- Did you allow him to hope ?"" "" Oh ! my love , I could not then talk of hope to him or to myself ."
austen#"Marianne might at that moment be dying . But he did not ask for hope or encouragement . His was an involuntary confidence , an irrepressible effusion to a soothing friend -- not an application to a parent . Yet after a time I DID say , for at first I was quite overcome -- that if she lived , as I trusted she might , my greatest happiness would lie in promoting their marriage ; and since our arrival , since our delightful security , I have repeated it to him more fully , have given him every encouragement in my power . Time , a very little time , I tell him , will do everything ;-- Marianne ' s heart is not to be wasted for ever on such a man as Willoughby .-- His own merits must soon secure it ."" "" To judge from the Colonel ' s spirits , however , you have not yet made him equally sanguine ."""
austen#""" No .-- He thinks Marianne ' s affection too deeply rooted for any change in it under a great length of time , and even supposing her heart again free , is too diffident of himself to believe , that with such a difference of age and disposition he could ever attach her . There , however , he is quite mistaken . His age is only so much beyond hers as to be an advantage , as to make his character and principles fixed ;-- and his disposition , I am well convinced , is exactly the very one to make your sister happy . And his person , his manners too , are all in his favour . My partiality does not blind me ; he certainly is not so handsome as Willoughby -- but at the same time , there is something much more pleasing in his countenance .-- There was always a something ,-- if you remember ,-- in Willoughby ' s eyes at times , which I did not like ."" Elinor could NOT remember it ;-- but her mother , without waiting for her assent , continued ,"
austen#""" And his manners , the Colonel ' s manners are not only more pleasing to me than Willoughby ' s ever were , but they are of a kind I well know to be more solidly attaching to Marianne . Their gentleness , their genuine attention to other people , and their manly unstudied simplicity is much more accordant with her real disposition , than the liveliness -- often artificial , and often ill - timed of the other . I am very sure myself , that had Willoughby turned out as really amiable , as he has proved himself the contrary , Marianne would yet never have been so happy with HIM , as she will be with Colonel Brandon ."" She paused .-- Her daughter could not quite agree with her , but her dissent was not heard , and therefore gave no offence . "" At Delaford , she will be within an easy distance of me ,"" added Mrs . Dashwood , "" even if I remain at Barton ; and in all probability ,-- for I hear it is a large village ,-- indeed there certainly MUST be some small house or cottage close by , that would suit us quite as well as our present situation ."" Poor Elinor !-- here was a new scheme for getting her to Delaford !-- but her spirit was stubborn ."
austen#""" His fortune too !-- for at my time of life you know , everybody cares about THAT ;-- and though I neither know nor desire to know , what it really is , I am sure it must be a good one ."" Here they were interrupted by the entrance of a third person , and Elinor withdrew to think it all over in private , to wish success to her friend , and yet in wishing it , to feel a pang for Willoughby . CHAPTER 46 Marianne ' s illness , though weakening in its kind , had not been long enough to make her recovery slow ; and with youth , natural strength , and her mother ' s presence in aid , it proceeded so smoothly as to enable her to remove , within four days after the arrival of the latter , into Mrs . Palmer ' s dressing - room . When there , at her own particular request , for she was impatient to pour forth her thanks to him for fetching her mother , Colonel Brandon was invited to visit her . His emotion on entering the room , in seeing her altered looks , and in receiving the pale hand which she immediately held out to him , was such , as , in Elinor ' s conjecture , must arise from something more than his affection for Marianne , or the consciousness of its being known to others ; and she soon discovered in his melancholy eye and varying complexion as he looked at her sister , the probable recurrence of many past scenes of misery to his mind , brought back by that resemblance between Marianne and Eliza already acknowledged , and now strengthened by the hollow eye , the sickly skin , the posture of reclining weakness , and the warm acknowledgment of peculiar obligation ."
austen#Mrs . Dashwood , not less watchful of what passed than her daughter , but with a mind very differently influenced , and therefore watching to very different effect , saw nothing in the Colonel ' s behaviour but what arose from the most simple and self - evident sensations , while in the actions and words of Marianne she persuaded herself to think that something more than gratitude already dawned . At the end of another day or two , Marianne growing visibly stronger every twelve hours , Mrs . Dashwood , urged equally by her own and her daughter ' s wishes , began to talk of removing to Barton . On HER measures depended those of her two friends ; Mrs . Jennings could not quit Cleveland during the Dashwoods ' stay ; and Colonel Brandon was soon brought , by their united request , to consider his own abode there as equally determinate , if not equally indispensable . At his and Mrs . Jennings ' s united request in return , Mrs . Dashwood was prevailed on to accept the use of his carriage on her journey back , for the better accommodation of her sick child ; and the Colonel , at the joint invitation of Mrs . Dashwood and Mrs . Jennings , whose active good - nature made her friendly and hospitable for other people as well as herself , engaged with pleasure to redeem it by a visit at the cottage , in the course of a few weeks . The day of separation and departure arrived ; and Marianne , after taking so particular and lengthened a leave of Mrs . Jennings , one so earnestly grateful , so full of respect and kind wishes as seemed due to her own heart from a secret acknowledgment of past inattention , and bidding Colonel Brandon farewell with a cordiality of a friend , was carefully assisted by him into the carriage , of which he seemed anxious that she should engross at least half . Mrs . Dashwood and Elinor then followed , and the others were left by themselves , to talk of the travellers , and feel their own dullness , till Mrs . Jennings was summoned to her chaise to take comfort in the gossip of her maid for the loss of her two young companions ; and Colonel Brandon immediately afterwards took his solitary way to Delaford .
austen#The Dashwoods were two days on the road , and Marianne bore her journey on both , without essential fatigue . Every thing that the most zealous affection , the most solicitous care could do to render her comfortable , was the office of each watchful companion , and each found their reward in her bodily ease , and her calmness of spirits . To Elinor , the observation of the latter was particularly grateful . She , who had seen her week after week so constantly suffering , oppressed by anguish of heart which she had neither courage to speak of , nor fortitude to conceal , now saw with a joy , which no other could equally share , an apparent composure of mind , which , in being the result as she trusted of serious reflection , must eventually lead her to contentment and cheerfulness . As they approached Barton , indeed , and entered on scenes of which every field and every tree brought some peculiar , some painful recollection , she grew silent and thoughtful , and turning away her face from their notice , sat earnestly gazing through the window . But here , Elinor could neither wonder nor blame ; and when she saw , as she assisted Marianne from the carriage , that she had been crying , she saw only an emotion too natural in itself to raise any thing less tender than pity , and in its unobtrusiveness entitled to praise .
austen#"In the whole of her subsequent manner , she traced the direction of a mind awakened to reasonable exertion ; for no sooner had they entered their common sitting - room , than Marianne turned her eyes around it with a look of resolute firmness , as if determined at once to accustom herself to the sight of every object with which the remembrance of Willoughby could be connected .-- She said little , but every sentence aimed at cheerfulness , and though a sigh sometimes escaped her , it never passed away without the atonement of a smile . After dinner she would try her piano - forte . She went to it ; but the music on which her eye first rested was an opera , procured for her by Willoughby , containing some of their favourite duets , and bearing on its outward leaf her own name in his hand - writing .-- That would not do .-- She shook her head , put the music aside , and after running over the keys for a minute , complained of feebleness in her fingers , and closed the instrument again ; declaring however with firmness as she did so , that she should in future practice much . The next morning produced no abatement in these happy symptoms . On the contrary , with a mind and body alike strengthened by rest , she looked and spoke with more genuine spirit , anticipating the pleasure of Margaret ' s return , and talking of the dear family party which would then be restored , of their mutual pursuits and cheerful society , as the only happiness worth a wish . "" When the weather is settled , and I have recovered my strength ,"" said she , "" we will take long walks together every day ."
austen#We will walk to the farm at the edge of the down , and see how the children go on ; we will walk to Sir John ' s new plantations at Barton Cross , and the Abbeyland ; and we will often go the old ruins of the Priory , and try to trace its foundations as far as we are told they once reached . I know we shall be happy . I know the summer will pass happily away . I mean never to be later in rising than six , and from that time till dinner I shall divide every moment between music and reading . I have formed my plan , and am determined to enter on a course of serious study . Our own library is too well known to me , to be resorted to for any thing beyond mere amusement .
austen#"But there are many works well worth reading at the Park ; and there are others of more modern production which I know I can borrow of Colonel Brandon . By reading only six hours a - day , I shall gain in the course of a twelve - month a great deal of instruction which I now feel myself to want ."" Elinor honoured her for a plan which originated so nobly as this ; though smiling to see the same eager fancy which had been leading her to the extreme of languid indolence and selfish repining , now at work in introducing excess into a scheme of such rational employment and virtuous self - control . Her smile however changed to a sigh when she remembered that promise to Willoughby was yet unfulfilled , and feared she had that to communicate which might again unsettle the mind of Marianne , and ruin at least for a time this fair prospect of busy tranquillity . Willing therefore to delay the evil hour , she resolved to wait till her sister ' s health were more secure , before she appointed it . But the resolution was made only to be broken ."
austen#"Marianne had been two or three days at home , before the weather was fine enough for an invalid like herself to venture out . But at last a soft , genial morning appeared ; such as might tempt the daughter ' s wishes and the mother ' s confidence ; and Marianne , leaning on Elinor ' s arm , was authorised to walk as long as she could without fatigue , in the lane before the house . The sisters set out at a pace , slow as the feebleness of Marianne in an exercise hitherto untried since her illness required ;-- and they had advanced only so far beyond the house as to admit a full view of the hill , the important hill behind , when pausing with her eyes turned towards it , Marianne calmly said , "" There , exactly there ,""-- pointing with one hand , "" on that projecting mound ,-- there I fell ; and there I first saw Willoughby ."" Her voice sunk with the word , but presently reviving she added , "" I am thankful to find that I can look with so little pain on the spot !-- shall we ever talk on that subject , Elinor ?"""
austen#"-- hesitatingly it was said .--"" Or will it be wrong ?-- I can talk of it now , I hope , as I ought to do ."" -- Elinor tenderly invited her to be open . "" As for regret ,"" said Marianne , "" I have done with that , as far as HE is concerned . I do not mean to talk to you of what my feelings have been for him , but what they are NOW .-- At present , if I could be satisfied on one point , if I could be allowed to think that he was not ALWAYS acting a part , not ALWAYS deceiving me ;-- but above all , if I could be assured that he never was so VERY wicked as my fears have sometimes fancied him , since the story of that unfortunate girl ""-- She stopt ."
austen#"Elinor joyfully treasured her words as she answered , "" If you could be assured of that , you think you should be easy ."" "" Yes . My peace of mind is doubly involved in it ;-- for not only is it horrible to suspect a person , who has been what HE has been to ME , of such designs ,-- but what must it make me appear to myself ?-- What in a situation like mine , but a most shamefully unguarded affection could expose me to ""-- "" How then ,"" asked her sister , "" would you account for his behaviour ?"" "" I would suppose him ,-- Oh , how gladly would I suppose him , only fickle , very , very fickle ."""
austen#"Elinor said no more . She was debating within herself on the eligibility of beginning her story directly , or postponing it till Marianne were in stronger health ;-- and they crept on for a few minutes in silence . "" I am not wishing him too much good ,"" said Marianne at last with a sigh , "" when I wish his secret reflections may be no more unpleasant than my own . He will suffer enough in them ."" "" Do you compare your conduct with his ?"" "" No ."
austen#"I compare it with what it ought to have been ; I compare it with yours ."" "" Our situations have borne little resemblance ."" "" They have borne more than our conduct .-- Do not , my dearest Elinor , let your kindness defend what I know your judgment must censure . My illness has made me think -- It has given me leisure and calmness for serious recollection . Long before I was enough recovered to talk , I was perfectly able to reflect . I considered the past : I saw in my own behaviour , since the beginning of our acquaintance with him last autumn , nothing but a series of imprudence towards myself , and want of kindness to others ."
austen#I saw that my own feelings had prepared my sufferings , and that my want of fortitude under them had almost led me to the grave . My illness , I well knew , had been entirely brought on by myself by such negligence of my own health , as I had felt even at the time to be wrong . Had I died ,-- it would have been self - destruction . I did not know my danger till the danger was removed ; but with such feelings as these reflections gave me , I wonder at my recovery ,-- wonder that the very eagerness of my desire to live , to have time for atonement to my God , and to you all , did not kill me at once . Had I died ,-- in what peculiar misery should I have left you , my nurse , my friend , my sister !-- You , who had seen all the fretful selfishness of my latter days ; who had known all the murmurings of my heart !-- How should I have lived in YOUR remembrance !-- My mother too ! How could you have consoled her !-- I cannot express my own abhorrence of myself .
austen#Whenever I looked towards the past , I saw some duty neglected , or some failing indulged . Every body seemed injured by me . The kindness , the unceasing kindness of Mrs . Jennings , I had repaid with ungrateful contempt . To the Middletons , to the Palmers , the Steeles , to every common acquaintance even , I had been insolent and unjust ; with a heart hardened against their merits , and a temper irritated by their very attention .-- To John , to Fanny ,-- yes , even to them , little as they deserve , I had given less than their due . But you ,-- you above all , above my mother , had been wronged by me . I , and only I , knew your heart and its sorrows ; yet to what did it influence me ?-- not to any compassion that could benefit you or myself .-- Your example was before me ; but to what avail ?-- Was I more considerate of you and your comfort ?
austen#"Did I imitate your forbearance , or lessen your restraints , by taking any part in those offices of general complaisance or particular gratitude which you had hitherto been left to discharge alone ?-- No ;-- not less when I knew you to be unhappy , than when I had believed you at ease , did I turn away from every exertion of duty or friendship ; scarcely allowing sorrow to exist but with me , regretting only THAT heart which had deserted and wronged me , and leaving you , for or I professed an unbounded affection , to be miserable for my sake ."" Here ceased the rapid flow of her self - reproving spirit ; and Elinor , impatient to soothe , though too honest to flatter , gave her instantly that praise and support which her frankness and her contrition so well deserved . Marianne pressed her hand and replied , "" You are very good .-- The future must be my proof . I have laid down my plan , and if I am capable of adhering to it -- my feelings shall be governed and my temper improved . They shall no longer worry others , nor torture myself ."
austen#"I shall now live solely for my family . You , my mother , and Margaret , must henceforth be all the world to me ; you will share my affections entirely between you . > From you , from my home , I shall never again have the smallest incitement to move ; and if I do mix in other society , it will be only to shew that my spirit is humbled , my heart amended , and that I can practise the civilities , the lesser duties of life , with gentleness and forbearance . As for Willoughby -- to say that I shall soon or that I shall ever forget him , would be idle . His remembrance can be overcome by no change of circumstances or opinions . But it shall be regulated , it shall be checked by religion , by reason , by constant employment ."""
austen#"She paused -- and added in a low voice , "" If I could but know HIS heart , everything would become easy ."" Elinor , who had now been for some time reflecting on the propriety or impropriety of speedily hazarding her narration , without feeling at all nearer decision than at first , heard this ; and perceiving that as reflection did nothing , resolution must do all , soon found herself leading to the fact . She managed the recital , as she hoped , with address ; prepared her anxious listener with caution ; related simply and honestly the chief points on which Willoughby grounded his apology ; did justice to his repentance , and softened only his protestations of present regard . Marianne said not a word .-- She trembled , her eyes were fixed on the ground , and her lips became whiter than even sickness had left them . A thousand inquiries sprung up from her heart , but she dared not urge one . She caught every syllable with panting eagerness ; her hand , unknowingly to herself , closely pressed her sister ' s , and tears covered her cheeks ."
austen#"Elinor , dreading her being tired , led her towards home ; and till they reached the door of the cottage , easily conjecturing what her curiosity must be though no question was suffered to speak it , talked of nothing but Willoughby , and their conversation together ; and was carefully minute in every particular of speech and look , where minuteness could be safely indulged . As soon as they entered the house , Marianne with a kiss of gratitude and these two words just articulate through her tears , "" Tell mama ,"" withdrew from her sister and walked slowly up stairs . Elinor would not attempt to disturb a solitude so reasonable as what she now sought ; and with a mind anxiously pre - arranging its result , and a resolution of reviving the subject again , should Marianne fail to do it , she turned into the parlour to fulfill her parting injunction . CHAPTER 47 Mrs . Dashwood did not hear unmoved the vindication of her former favourite . She rejoiced in his being cleared from some part of his imputed guilt ;-- she was sorry for him ;-- she wished him happy ."
austen#But the feelings of the past could not be recalled .-- Nothing could restore him with a faith unbroken -- a character unblemished , to Marianne . Nothing could do away the knowledge of what the latter had suffered through his means , nor remove the guilt of his conduct towards Eliza . Nothing could replace him , therefore , in her former esteem , nor injure the interests of Colonel Brandon . Had Mrs . Dashwood , like her daughter , heard Willoughby ' s story from himself -- had she witnessed his distress , and been under the influence of his countenance and his manner , it is probable that her compassion would have been greater . But it was neither in Elinor ' s power , nor in her wish , to rouse such feelings in another , by her retailed explanation , as had at first been called forth in herself . Reflection had given calmness to her judgment , and sobered her own opinion of Willoughby ' s deserts ;-- she wished , therefore , to declare only the simple truth , and lay open such facts as were really due to his character , without any embellishment of tenderness to lead the fancy astray .
austen#"In the evening , when they were all three together , Marianne began voluntarily to speak of him again ;-- but that it was not without an effort , the restless , unquiet thoughtfulness in which she had been for some time previously sitting -- her rising colour , as she spoke ,-- and her unsteady voice , plainly shewed . "" I wish to assure you both ,"" said she , "" that I see every thing -- as you can desire me to do ."" Mrs . Dashwood would have interrupted her instantly with soothing tenderness , had not Elinor , who really wished to hear her sister ' s unbiased opinion , by an eager sign , engaged her silence . Marianne slowly continued -- "" It is a great relief to me -- what Elinor told me this morning -- I have now heard exactly what I wished to hear ."" -- For some moments her voice was lost ; but recovering herself , she added , and with greater calmness than before --"" I am now perfectly satisfied , I wish for no change ."
austen#"I never could have been happy with him , after knowing , as sooner or later I must have known , all this .-- I should have had no confidence , no esteem . Nothing could have done it away to my feelings ."" "" I know it -- I know it ,"" cried her mother . "" Happy with a man of libertine practices !-- With one who so injured the peace of the dearest of our friends , and the best of men !-- No -- my Marianne has not a heart to be made happy with such a man !-- Her conscience , her sensitive conscience , would have felt all that the conscience of her husband ought to have felt ."" Marianne sighed , and repeated , "" I wish for no change ."" "" You consider the matter ,"" said Elinor , "" exactly as a good mind and a sound understanding must consider it ; and I dare say you perceive , as well as myself , not only in this , but in many other circumstances , reason enough to be convinced that your marriage must have involved you in many certain troubles and disappointments , in which you would have been poorly supported by an affection , on his side , much less certain ."
austen#"Had you married , you must have been always poor . His expensiveness is acknowledged even by himself , and his whole conduct declares that self - denial is a word hardly understood by him . His demands and your inexperience together , on a small , very small income , must have brought on distresses which would not be the LESS grievous to you , from having been entirely unknown and unthought of before . YOUR sense of honour and honesty would have led you , I know , when aware of your situation , to attempt all the economy that would appear to you possible : and , perhaps , as long as your frugality retrenched only on your own comfort , you might have been suffered to practice it , but beyond that -- and how little could the utmost of your single management do to stop the ruin which had begun before your marriage ?-- Beyond THAT , had you endeavoured , however reasonably , to abridge HIS enjoyments , is it not to be feared , that instead of prevailing on feelings so selfish to consent to it , you would have lessened your own influence on his heart , and made him regret the connection which had involved him in such difficulties ?"" Marianne ' s lips quivered , and she repeated the word "" Selfish ?"" in a tone that implied --"" do you really think him selfish ?"""
austen#""" The whole of his behaviour ,"" replied Elinor , "" from the beginning to the end of the affair , has been grounded on selfishness . It was selfishness which first made him sport with your affections ; which afterwards , when his own were engaged , made him delay the confession of it , and which finally carried him from Barton . His own enjoyment , or his own ease , was , in every particular , his ruling principle ."" "" It is very true . MY happiness never was his object ."" "" At present ,"" continued Elinor , "" he regrets what he has done ."
austen#"And why does he regret it ?-- Because he finds it has not answered towards himself . It has not made him happy . His circumstances are now unembarrassed -- he suffers from no evil of that kind ; and he thinks only that he has married a woman of a less amiable temper than yourself . But does it follow that had he married you , he would have been happy ?-- The inconveniences would have been different . He would then have suffered under the pecuniary distresses which , because they are removed , he now reckons as nothing . He would have had a wife of whose temper he could make no complaint , but he would have been always necessitous -- always poor ; and probably would soon have learned to rank the innumerable comforts of a clear estate and good income as of far more importance , even to domestic happiness , than the mere temper of a wife ."""
austen#""" I have not a doubt of it ,"" said Marianne ; "" and I have nothing to regret -- nothing but my own folly ."" "" Rather say your mother ' s imprudence , my child ,"" said Mrs . Dashwood ; "" SHE must be answerable ."" Marianne would not let her proceed ;-- and Elinor , satisfied that each felt their own error , wished to avoid any survey of the past that might weaken her sister ' s spirits ; she , therefore , pursuing the first subject , immediately continued , "" One observation may , I think , be fairly drawn from the whole of the story -- that all Willoughby ' s difficulties have arisen from the first offence against virtue , in his behaviour to Eliza Williams . That crime has been the origin of every lesser one , and of all his present discontents ."" Marianne assented most feelingly to the remark ; and her mother was led by it to an enumeration of Colonel Brandon ' s injuries and merits , warm as friendship and design could unitedly dictate ."
austen#"Her daughter did not look , however , as if much of it were heard by her . Elinor , according to her expectation , saw on the two or three following days , that Marianne did not continue to gain strength as she had done ; but while her resolution was unsubdued , and she still tried to appear cheerful and easy , her sister could safely trust to the effect of time upon her health . Margaret returned , and the family were again all restored to each other , again quietly settled at the cottage ; and if not pursuing their usual studies with quite so much vigour as when they first came to Barton , at least planning a vigorous prosecution of them in future . Elinor grew impatient for some tidings of Edward . She had heard nothing of him since her leaving London , nothing new of his plans , nothing certain even of his present abode . Some letters had passed between her and her brother , in consequence of Marianne ' s illness ; and in the first of John ' s , there had been this sentence :-- "" We know nothing of our unfortunate Edward , and can make no enquiries on so prohibited a subject , but conclude him to be still at Oxford ;"" which was all the intelligence of Edward afforded her by the correspondence , for his name was not even mentioned in any of the succeeding letters ."
austen#"She was not doomed , however , to be long in ignorance of his measures . Their man - servant had been sent one morning to Exeter on business ; and when , as he waited at table , he had satisfied the inquiries of his mistress as to the event of his errand , this was his voluntary communication -- "" I suppose you know , ma ' am , that Mr . Ferrars is married ."" Marianne gave a violent start , fixed her eyes upon Elinor , saw her turning pale , and fell back in her chair in hysterics . Mrs . Dashwood , whose eyes , as she answered the servant ' s inquiry , had intuitively taken the same direction , was shocked to perceive by Elinor ' s countenance how much she really suffered , and a moment afterwards , alike distressed by Marianne ' s situation , knew not on which child to bestow her principal attention . The servant , who saw only that Miss Marianne was taken ill , had sense enough to call one of the maids , who , with Mrs . Dashwood ' s assistance , supported her into the other room ."
austen#"By that time , Marianne was rather better , and her mother leaving her to the care of Margaret and the maid , returned to Elinor , who , though still much disordered , had so far recovered the use of her reason and voice as to be just beginning an inquiry of Thomas , as to the source of his intelligence . Mrs . Dashwood immediately took all that trouble on herself ; and Elinor had the benefit of the information without the exertion of seeking it . "" Who told you that Mr . Ferrars was married , Thomas ?"" "" I see Mr . Ferrars myself , ma ' am , this morning in Exeter , and his lady too , Miss Steele as was . They was stopping in a chaise at the door of the New London Inn , as I went there with a message from Sally at the Park to her brother , who is one of the post - boys . I happened to look up as I went by the chaise , and so I see directly it was the youngest Miss Steele ; so I took off my hat , and she knew me and called to me , and inquired after you , ma ' am , and the young ladies , especially Miss Marianne , and bid me I should give her compliments and Mr . Ferrars ' s , their best compliments and service , and how sorry they was they had not time to come on and see you , but they was in a great hurry to go forwards , for they was going further down for a little while , but howsever , when they come back , they ' d make sure to come and see you ."""
austen#""" But did she tell you she was married , Thomas ?"" "" Yes , ma ' am . She smiled , and said how she had changed her name since she was in these parts . She was always a very affable and free - spoken young lady , and very civil behaved . So , I made free to wish her joy ."" "" Was Mr . Ferrars in the carriage with her ?"""
austen#""" Yes , ma ' am , I just see him leaning back in it , but he did not look up ;-- he never was a gentleman much for talking ."" Elinor ' s heart could easily account for his not putting himself forward ; and Mrs . Dashwood probably found the same explanation . "" Was there no one else in the carriage ?"" "" No , ma ' am , only they two ."" "" Do you know where they came from ?"" "" They come straight from town , as Miss Lucy -- Mrs . Ferrars told me ."""
austen#""" And are they going farther westward ?"" "" Yes , ma ' am -- but not to bide long . They will soon be back again , and then they ' d be sure and call here ."" Mrs . Dashwood now looked at her daughter ; but Elinor knew better than to expect them . She recognised the whole of Lucy in the message , and was very confident that Edward would never come near them . She observed in a low voice , to her mother , that they were probably going down to Mr . Pratt ' s , near Plymouth ."
austen#"Thomas ' s intelligence seemed over . Elinor looked as if she wished to hear more . "" Did you see them off , before you came away ?"" "" No , ma ' am -- the horses were just coming out , but I could not bide any longer ; I was afraid of being late ."" "" Did Mrs . Ferrars look well ?"" "" Yes , ma ' am , she said how she was very well ; and to my mind she was always a very handsome young lady -- and she seemed vastly contented ."""
austen#Mrs . Dashwood could think of no other question , and Thomas and the tablecloth , now alike needless , were soon afterwards dismissed . Marianne had already sent to say , that she should eat nothing more . Mrs . Dashwood ' s and Elinor ' s appetites were equally lost , and Margaret might think herself very well off , that with so much uneasiness as both her sisters had lately experienced , so much reason as they had often had to be careless of their meals , she had never been obliged to go without her dinner before . When the dessert and the wine were arranged , and Mrs . Dashwood and Elinor were left by themselves , they remained long together in a similarity of thoughtfulness and silence . Mrs . Dashwood feared to hazard any remark , and ventured not to offer consolation . She now found that she had erred in relying on Elinor ' s representation of herself ; and justly concluded that every thing had been expressly softened at the time , to spare her from an increase of unhappiness , suffering as she then had suffered for Marianne .
austen#She found that she had been misled by the careful , the considerate attention of her daughter , to think the attachment , which once she had so well understood , much slighter in reality , than she had been wont to believe , or than it was now proved to be . She feared that under this persuasion she had been unjust , inattentive , nay , almost unkind , to her Elinor ;-- that Marianne ' s affliction , because more acknowledged , more immediately before her , had too much engrossed her tenderness , and led her away to forget that in Elinor she might have a daughter suffering almost as much , certainly with less self - provocation , and greater fortitude . CHAPTER 48 Elinor now found the difference between the expectation of an unpleasant event , however certain the mind may be told to consider it , and certainty itself . She now found , that in spite of herself , she had always admitted a hope , while Edward remained single , that something would occur to prevent his marrying Lucy ; that some resolution of his own , some mediation of friends , or some more eligible opportunity of establishment for the lady , would arise to assist the happiness of all . But he was now married ; and she condemned her heart for the lurking flattery , which so much heightened the pain of the intelligence .
austen#That he should be married soon , before ( as she imagined ) he could be in orders , and consequently before he could be in possession of the living , surprised her a little at first . But she soon saw how likely it was that Lucy , in her self - provident care , in her haste to secure him , should overlook every thing but the risk of delay . They were married , married in town , and now hastening down to her uncle ' s . What had Edward felt on being within four miles from Barton , on seeing her mother ' s servant , on hearing Lucy ' s message ! They would soon , she supposed , be settled at Delaford .-- Delaford ,-- that place in which so much conspired to give her an interest ; which she wished to be acquainted with , and yet desired to avoid . She saw them in an instant in their parsonage - house ; saw in Lucy , the active , contriving manager , uniting at once a desire of smart appearance with the utmost frugality , and ashamed to be suspected of half her economical practices ;-- pursuing her own interest in every thought , courting the favour of Colonel Brandon , of Mrs . Jennings , and of every wealthy friend .
austen#"In Edward -- she knew not what she saw , nor what she wished to see ;-- happy or unhappy ,-- nothing pleased her ; she turned away her head from every sketch of him . Elinor flattered herself that some one of their connections in London would write to them to announce the event , and give farther particulars ,-- but day after day passed off , and brought no letter , no tidings . Though uncertain that any one were to blame , she found fault with every absent friend . They were all thoughtless or indolent . "" When do you write to Colonel Brandon , ma ' am ?"" was an inquiry which sprung from the impatience of her mind to have something going on ."
austen#""" I wrote to him , my love , last week , and rather expect to see , than to hear from him again . I earnestly pressed his coming to us , and should not be surprised to see him walk in today or tomorrow , or any day ."" This was gaining something , something to look forward to . Colonel Brandon must have some information to give . Scarcely had she so determined it , when the figure of a man on horseback drew her eyes to the window . He stopt at their gate ."
austen#It was a gentleman , it was Colonel Brandon himself . Now she could hear more ; and she trembled in expectation of it . But -- it was NOT Colonel Brandon -- neither his air -- nor his height . Were it possible , she must say it must be Edward . She looked again . He had just dismounted ;-- she could not be mistaken ,-- it WAS Edward .
austen#"She moved away and sat down . "" He comes from Mr . Pratt ' s purposely to see us . I WILL be calm ; I WILL be mistress of myself ."" In a moment she perceived that the others were likewise aware of the mistake . She saw her mother and Marianne change colour ; saw them look at herself , and whisper a few sentences to each other . She would have given the world to be able to speak -- and to make them understand that she hoped no coolness , no slight , would appear in their behaviour to him ;-- but she had no utterance , and was obliged to leave all to their own discretion ."
austen#Not a syllable passed aloud . They all waited in silence for the appearance of their visitor . His footsteps were heard along the gravel path ; in a moment he was in the passage , and in another he was before them . His countenance , as he entered the room , was not too happy , even for Elinor . His complexion was white with agitation , and he looked as if fearful of his reception , and conscious that he merited no kind one . Mrs . Dashwood , however , conforming , as she trusted , to the wishes of that daughter , by whom she then meant in the warmth of her heart to be guided in every thing , met with a look of forced complacency , gave him her hand , and wished him joy .
austen#He coloured , and stammered out an unintelligible reply . Elinor ' s lips had moved with her mother ' s , and , when the moment of action was over , she wished that she had shaken hands with him too . But it was then too late , and with a countenance meaning to be open , she sat down again and talked of the weather . Marianne had retreated as much as possible out of sight , to conceal her distress ; and Margaret , understanding some part , but not the whole of the case , thought it incumbent on her to be dignified , and therefore took a seat as far from him as she could , and maintained a strict silence . When Elinor had ceased to rejoice in the dryness of the season , a very awful pause took place . It was put an end to by Mrs . Dashwood , who felt obliged to hope that he had left Mrs . Ferrars very well .
austen#"In a hurried manner , he replied in the affirmative . Another pause . Elinor resolving to exert herself , though fearing the sound of her own voice , now said , "" Is Mrs . Ferrars at Longstaple ?"" "" At Longstaple !"" he replied , with an air of surprise .-- "" No , my mother is in town ."""
austen#""" I meant ,"" said Elinor , taking up some work from the table , "" to inquire for Mrs . EDWARD Ferrars ."" She dared not look up ;-- but her mother and Marianne both turned their eyes on him . He coloured , seemed perplexed , looked doubtingly , and , after some hesitation , said ,-- "" Perhaps you mean -- my brother -- you mean Mrs .-- Mrs . ROBERT Ferrars ."" "" Mrs . Robert Ferrars !"" -- was repeated by Marianne and her mother in an accent of the utmost amazement ;-- and though Elinor could not speak , even HER eyes were fixed on him with the same impatient wonder ."
austen#"He rose from his seat , and walked to the window , apparently from not knowing what to do ; took up a pair of scissors that lay there , and while spoiling both them and their sheath by cutting the latter to pieces as he spoke , said , in a hurried voice , "" Perhaps you do not know -- you may not have heard that my brother is lately married to -- to the youngest -- to Miss Lucy Steele ."" His words were echoed with unspeakable astonishment by all but Elinor , who sat with her head leaning over her work , in a state of such agitation as made her hardly know where she was . "" Yes ,"" said he , "" they were married last week , and are now at Dawlish ."" Elinor could sit it no longer . She almost ran out of the room , and as soon as the door was closed , burst into tears of joy , which at first she thought would never cease ."
austen#Edward , who had till then looked any where , rather than at her , saw her hurry away , and perhaps saw -- or even heard , her emotion ; for immediately afterwards he fell into a reverie , which no remarks , no inquiries , no affectionate address of Mrs . Dashwood could penetrate , and at last , without saying a word , quitted the room , and walked out towards the village -- leaving the others in the greatest astonishment and perplexity on a change in his situation , so wonderful and so sudden ;-- a perplexity which they had no means of lessening but by their own conjectures . CHAPTER 49 Unaccountable , however , as the circumstances of his release might appear to the whole family , it was certain that Edward was free ; and to what purpose that freedom would be employed was easily pre - determined by all ;-- for after experiencing the blessings of ONE imprudent engagement , contracted without his mother ' s consent , as he had already done for more than four years , nothing less could be expected of him in the failure of THAT , than the immediate contraction of another . His errand at Barton , in fact , was a simple one . It was only to ask Elinor to marry him ;-- and considering that he was not altogether inexperienced in such a question , it might be strange that he should feel so uncomfortable in the present case as he really did , so much in need of encouragement and fresh air . How soon he had walked himself into the proper resolution , however , how soon an opportunity of exercising it occurred , in what manner he expressed himself , and how he was received , need not be particularly told .
austen#This only need be said ;-- that when they all sat down to table at four o ' clock , about three hours after his arrival , he had secured his lady , engaged her mother ' s consent , and was not only in the rapturous profession of the lover , but , in the reality of reason and truth , one of the happiest of men . His situation indeed was more than commonly joyful . He had more than the ordinary triumph of accepted love to swell his heart , and raise his spirits . He was released without any reproach to himself , from an entanglement which had long formed his misery , from a woman whom he had long ceased to love ;-- and elevated at once to that security with another , which he must have thought of almost with despair , as soon as he had learnt to consider it with desire . He was brought , not from doubt or suspense , but from misery to happiness ;-- and the change was openly spoken in such a genuine , flowing , grateful cheerfulness , as his friends had never witnessed in him before . His heart was now open to Elinor , all its weaknesses , all its errors confessed , and his first boyish attachment to Lucy treated with all the philosophic dignity of twenty - four .
austen#""" It was a foolish , idle inclination on my side ,"" said he , "" the consequence of ignorance of the world -- and want of employment . Had my brother given me some active profession when I was removed at eighteen from the care of Mr . Pratt , I think -- nay , I am sure , it would never have happened ; for though I left Longstaple with what I thought , at the time , a most unconquerable preference for his niece , yet had I then had any pursuit , any object to engage my time and keep me at a distance from her for a few months , I should very soon have outgrown the fancied attachment , especially by mixing more with the world , as in such case I must have done . But instead of having any thing to do , instead of having any profession chosen for me , or being allowed to chuse any myself , I returned home to be completely idle ; and for the first twelvemonth afterwards I had not even the nominal employment , which belonging to the university would have given me ; for I was not entered at Oxford till I was nineteen . I had therefore nothing in the world to do , but to fancy myself in love ; and as my mother did not make my home in every respect comfortable , as I had no friend , no companion in my brother , and disliked new acquaintance , it was not unnatural for me to be very often at Longstaple , where I always felt myself at home , and was always sure of a welcome ; and accordingly I spent the greatest part of my time there from eighteen to nineteen : Lucy appeared everything that was amiable and obliging . She was pretty too -- at least I thought so THEN ; and I had seen so little of other women , that I could make no comparisons , and see no defects . Considering everything , therefore , I hope , foolish as our engagement was , foolish as it has since in every way been proved , it was not at the time an unnatural or an inexcusable piece of folly ."""
austen#The change which a few hours had wrought in the minds and the happiness of the Dashwoods , was such -- so great -- as promised them all , the satisfaction of a sleepless night . Mrs . Dashwood , too happy to be comfortable , knew not how to love Edward , nor praise Elinor enough , how to be enough thankful for his release without wounding his delicacy , nor how at once to give them leisure for unrestrained conversation together , and yet enjoy , as she wished , the sight and society of both . Marianne could speak HER happiness only by tears . Comparisons would occur -- regrets would arise ;-- and her joy , though sincere as her love for her sister , was of a kind to give her neither spirits nor language . But Elinor -- how are HER feelings to be described ?-- From the moment of learning that Lucy was married to another , that Edward was free , to the moment of his justifying the hopes which had so instantly followed , she was every thing by turns but tranquil . But when the second moment had passed , when she found every doubt , every solicitude removed , compared her situation with what so lately it had been ,-- saw him honourably released from his former engagement , saw him instantly profiting by the release , to address herself and declare an affection as tender , as constant as she had ever supposed it to be ,-- she was oppressed , she was overcome by her own felicity ;-- and happily disposed as is the human mind to be easily familiarized with any change for the better , it required several hours to give sedateness to her spirits , or any degree of tranquillity to her heart .
austen#Edward was now fixed at the cottage at least for a week ;-- for whatever other claims might be made on him , it was impossible that less than a week should be given up to the enjoyment of Elinor ' s company , or suffice to say half that was to be said of the past , the present , and the future ;-- for though a very few hours spent in the hard labor of incessant talking will despatch more subjects than can really be in common between any two rational creatures , yet with lovers it is different . Between THEM no subject is finished , no communication is even made , till it has been made at least twenty times over . Lucy ' s marriage , the unceasing and reasonable wonder among them all , formed of course one of the earliest discussions of the lovers ;-- and Elinor ' s particular knowledge of each party made it appear to her in every view , as one of the most extraordinary and unaccountable circumstances she had ever heard . How they could be thrown together , and by what attraction Robert could be drawn on to marry a girl , of whose beauty she had herself heard him speak without any admiration ,-- a girl too already engaged to his brother , and on whose account that brother had been thrown off by his family -- it was beyond her comprehension to make out . To her own heart it was a delightful affair , to her imagination it was even a ridiculous one , but to her reason , her judgment , it was completely a puzzle . Edward could only attempt an explanation by supposing , that , perhaps , at first accidentally meeting , the vanity of the one had been so worked on by the flattery of the other , as to lead by degrees to all the rest .
austen#"Elinor remembered what Robert had told her in Harley Street , of his opinion of what his own mediation in his brother ' s affairs might have done , if applied to in time . She repeated it to Edward . "" THAT was exactly like Robert ,""-- was his immediate observation .--"" And THAT ,"" he presently added , "" might perhaps be in HIS head when the acquaintance between them first began . And Lucy perhaps at first might think only of procuring his good offices in my favour . Other designs might afterward arise ."" How long it had been carrying on between them , however , he was equally at a loss with herself to make out ; for at Oxford , where he had remained for choice ever since his quitting London , he had had no means of hearing of her but from herself , and her letters to the very last were neither less frequent , nor less affectionate than usual ."
austen#"Not the smallest suspicion , therefore , had ever occurred to prepare him for what followed ;-- and when at last it burst on him in a letter from Lucy herself , he had been for some time , he believed , half stupified between the wonder , the horror , and the joy of such a deliverance . He put the letter into Elinor ' s hands . "" DEAR SIR , "" Being very sure I have long lost your affections , I have thought myself at liberty to bestow my own on another , and have no doubt of being as happy with him as I once used to think I might be with you ; but I scorn to accept a hand while the heart was another ' s . Sincerely wish you happy in your choice , and it shall not be my fault if we are not always good friends , as our near relationship now makes proper . I can safely say I owe you no ill - will , and am sure you will be too generous to do us any ill offices ."
austen#"Your brother has gained my affections entirely , and as we could not live without one another , we are just returned from the altar , and are now on our way to Dawlish for a few weeks , which place your dear brother has great curiosity to see , but thought I would first trouble you with these few lines , and shall always remain , "" Your sincere well - wisher , friend , and sister , "" LUCY FERRARS . "" I have burnt all your letters , and will return your picture the first opportunity . Please to destroy my scrawls -- but the ring with my hair you are very welcome to keep ."" Elinor read and returned it without any comment . "" I will not ask your opinion of it as a composition ,"" said Edward .--"" For worlds would not I have had a letter of hers seen by YOU in former days .-- In a sister it is bad enough , but in a wife !-- how I have blushed over the pages of her writing !-- and I believe I may say that since the first half year of our foolish -- business -- this is the only letter I ever received from her , of which the substance made me any amends for the defect of the style ."""
austen#""" However it may have come about ,"" said Elinor , after a pause ,--"" they are certainly married . And your mother has brought on herself a most appropriate punishment . The independence she settled on Robert , through resentment against you , has put it in his power to make his own choice ; and she has actually been bribing one son with a thousand a - year , to do the very deed which she disinherited the other for intending to do . She will hardly be less hurt , I suppose , by Robert ' s marrying Lucy , than she would have been by your marrying her ."" "" She will be more hurt by it , for Robert always was her favourite .-- She will be more hurt by it , and on the same principle will forgive him much sooner ."" In what state the affair stood at present between them , Edward knew not , for no communication with any of his family had yet been attempted by him ."
austen#He had quitted Oxford within four and twenty hours after Lucy ' s letter arrived , and with only one object before him , the nearest road to Barton , had had no leisure to form any scheme of conduct , with which that road did not hold the most intimate connection . He could do nothing till he were assured of his fate with Miss Dashwood ; and by his rapidity in seeking THAT fate , it is to be supposed , in spite of the jealousy with which he had once thought of Colonel Brandon , in spite of the modesty with which he rated his own deserts , and the politeness with which he talked of his doubts , he did not , upon the whole , expect a very cruel reception . It was his business , however , to say that he DID , and he said it very prettily . What he might say on the subject a twelvemonth after , must be referred to the imagination of husbands and wives . That Lucy had certainly meant to deceive , to go off with a flourish of malice against him in her message by Thomas , was perfectly clear to Elinor ; and Edward himself , now thoroughly enlightened on her character , had no scruple in believing her capable of the utmost meanness of wanton ill - nature . Though his eyes had been long opened , even before his acquaintance with Elinor began , to her ignorance and a want of liberality in some of her opinions -- they had been equally imputed , by him , to her want of education ; and till her last letter reached him , he had always believed her to be a well - disposed , good - hearted girl , and thoroughly attached to himself .
austen#"Nothing but such a persuasion could have prevented his putting an end to an engagement , which , long before the discovery of it laid him open to his mother ' s anger , had been a continual source of disquiet and regret to him . "" I thought it my duty ,"" said he , "" independent of my feelings , to give her the option of continuing the engagement or not , when I was renounced by my mother , and stood to all appearance without a friend in the world to assist me . In such a situation as that , where there seemed nothing to tempt the avarice or the vanity of any living creature , how could I suppose , when she so earnestly , so warmly insisted on sharing my fate , whatever it might be , that any thing but the most disinterested affection was her inducement ? And even now , I cannot comprehend on what motive she acted , or what fancied advantage it could be to her , to be fettered to a man for whom she had not the smallest regard , and who had only two thousand pounds in the world . She could not foresee that Colonel Brandon would give me a living ."" "" No ; but she might suppose that something would occur in your favour ; that your own family might in time relent ."
austen#"And at any rate , she lost nothing by continuing the engagement , for she has proved that it fettered neither her inclination nor her actions . The connection was certainly a respectable one , and probably gained her consideration among her friends ; and , if nothing more advantageous occurred , it would be better for her to marry YOU than be single ."" Edward was , of course , immediately convinced that nothing could have been more natural than Lucy ' s conduct , nor more self - evident than the motive of it . Elinor scolded him , harshly as ladies always scold the imprudence which compliments themselves , for having spent so much time with them at Norland , when he must have felt his own inconstancy . "" Your behaviour was certainly very wrong ,"" said she ; "" because -- to say nothing of my own conviction , our relations were all led away by it to fancy and expect WHAT , as you were THEN situated , could never be ."" He could only plead an ignorance of his own heart , and a mistaken confidence in the force of his engagement ."
austen#""" I was simple enough to think , that because my FAITH was plighted to another , there could be no danger in my being with you ; and that the consciousness of my engagement was to keep my heart as safe and sacred as my honour . I felt that I admired you , but I told myself it was only friendship ; and till I began to make comparisons between yourself and Lucy , I did not know how far I was got . After that , I suppose , I WAS wrong in remaining so much in Sussex , and the arguments with which I reconciled myself to the expediency of it , were no better than these :-- The danger is my own ; I am doing no injury to anybody but myself ."" Elinor smiled , and shook her head . Edward heard with pleasure of Colonel Brandon ' s being expected at the Cottage , as he really wished not only to be better acquainted with him , but to have an opportunity of convincing him that he no longer resented his giving him the living of Delaford --"" Which , at present ,"" said he , "" after thanks so ungraciously delivered as mine were on the occasion , he must think I have never forgiven him for offering ."" NOW he felt astonished himself that he had never yet been to the place ."
austen#But so little interest had be taken in the matter , that he owed all his knowledge of the house , garden , and glebe , extent of the parish , condition of the land , and rate of the tithes , to Elinor herself , who had heard so much of it from Colonel Brandon , and heard it with so much attention , as to be entirely mistress of the subject . One question after this only remained undecided , between them , one difficulty only was to be overcome . They were brought together by mutual affection , with the warmest approbation of their real friends ; their intimate knowledge of each other seemed to make their happiness certain -- and they only wanted something to live upon . Edward had two thousand pounds , and Elinor one , which , with Delaford living , was all that they could call their own ; for it was impossible that Mrs . Dashwood should advance anything ; and they were neither of them quite enough in love to think that three hundred and fifty pounds a - year would supply them with the comforts of life . Edward was not entirely without hopes of some favourable change in his mother towards him ; and on THAT he rested for the residue of their income . But Elinor had no such dependence ; for since Edward would still be unable to marry Miss Morton , and his chusing herself had been spoken of in Mrs . Ferrars ' s flattering language as only a lesser evil than his chusing Lucy Steele , she feared that Robert ' s offence would serve no other purpose than to enrich Fanny .
austen#About four days after Edward ' s arrival Colonel Brandon appeared , to complete Mrs . Dashwood ' s satisfaction , and to give her the dignity of having , for the first time since her living at Barton , more company with her than her house would hold . Edward was allowed to retain the privilege of first comer , and Colonel Brandon therefore walked every night to his old quarters at the Park ; from whence he usually returned in the morning , early enough to interrupt the lovers ' first tete - a - tete before breakfast . A three weeks ' residence at Delaford , where , in his evening hours at least , he had little to do but to calculate the disproportion between thirty - six and seventeen , brought him to Barton in a temper of mind which needed all the improvement in Marianne ' s looks , all the kindness of her welcome , and all the encouragement of her mother ' s language , to make it cheerful . Among such friends , however , and such flattery , he did revive . No rumour of Lucy ' s marriage had yet reached him :-- he knew nothing of what had passed ; and the first hours of his visit were consequently spent in hearing and in wondering . Every thing was explained to him by Mrs . Dashwood , and he found fresh reason to rejoice in what he had done for Mr . Ferrars , since eventually it promoted the interest of Elinor .
austen#"It would be needless to say , that the gentlemen advanced in the good opinion of each other , as they advanced in each other ' s acquaintance , for it could not be otherwise . Their resemblance in good principles and good sense , in disposition and manner of thinking , would probably have been sufficient to unite them in friendship , without any other attraction ; but their being in love with two sisters , and two sisters fond of each other , made that mutual regard inevitable and immediate , which might otherwise have waited the effect of time and judgment . The letters from town , which a few days before would have made every nerve in Elinor ' s body thrill with transport , now arrived to be read with less emotion that mirth . Mrs . Jennings wrote to tell the wonderful tale , to vent her honest indignation against the jilting girl , and pour forth her compassion towards poor Mr . Edward , who , she was sure , had quite doted upon the worthless hussy , and was now , by all accounts , almost broken - hearted , at Oxford .-- "" I do think ,"" she continued , "" nothing was ever carried on so sly ; for it was but two days before Lucy called and sat a couple of hours with me . Not a soul suspected anything of the matter , not even Nancy , who , poor soul ! came crying to me the day after , in a great fright for fear of Mrs . Ferrars , as well as not knowing how to get to Plymouth ; for Lucy it seems borrowed all her money before she went off to be married , on purpose we suppose to make a show with , and poor Nancy had not seven shillings in the world ;-- so I was very glad to give her five guineas to take her down to Exeter , where she thinks of staying three or four weeks with Mrs . Burgess , in hopes , as I tell her , to fall in with the Doctor again ."
austen#"And I must say that Lucy ' s crossness not to take them along with them in the chaise is worse than all . Poor Mr . Edward ! I cannot get him out of my head , but you must send for him to Barton , and Miss Marianne must try to comfort him ."" Mr . Dashwood ' s strains were more solemn . Mrs . Ferrars was the most unfortunate of women -- poor Fanny had suffered agonies of sensibility -- and he considered the existence of each , under such a blow , with grateful wonder . Robert ' s offence was unpardonable , but Lucy ' s was infinitely worse ."
austen#"Neither of them were ever again to be mentioned to Mrs . Ferrars ; and even , if she might hereafter be induced to forgive her son , his wife should never be acknowledged as her daughter , nor be permitted to appear in her presence . The secrecy with which everything had been carried on between them , was rationally treated as enormously heightening the crime , because , had any suspicion of it occurred to the others , proper measures would have been taken to prevent the marriage ; and he called on Elinor to join with him in regretting that Lucy ' s engagement with Edward had not rather been fulfilled , than that she should thus be the means of spreading misery farther in the family .-- He thus continued : "" Mrs . Ferrars has never yet mentioned Edward ' s name , which does not surprise us ; but , to our great astonishment , not a line has been received from him on the occasion . Perhaps , however , he is kept silent by his fear of offending , and I shall , therefore , give him a hint , by a line to Oxford , that his sister and I both think a letter of proper submission from him , addressed perhaps to Fanny , and by her shewn to her mother , might not be taken amiss ; for we all know the tenderness of Mrs . Ferrars ' s heart , and that she wishes for nothing so much as to be on good terms with her children ."" This paragraph was of some importance to the prospects and conduct of Edward . It determined him to attempt a reconciliation , though not exactly in the manner pointed out by their brother and sister ."
austen#""" A letter of proper submission !"" repeated he ; "" would they have me beg my mother ' s pardon for Robert ' s ingratitude to HER , and breach of honour to ME ?-- I can make no submission -- I am grown neither humble nor penitent by what has passed .-- I am grown very happy ; but that would not interest .-- I know of no submission that IS proper for me to make ."" "" You may certainly ask to be forgiven ,"" said Elinor , "" because you have offended ;-- and I should think you might NOW venture so far as to profess some concern for having ever formed the engagement which drew on you your mother ' s anger ."" He agreed that he might . "" And when she has forgiven you , perhaps a little humility may be convenient while acknowledging a second engagement , almost as imprudent in HER eyes as the first ."" He had nothing to urge against it , but still resisted the idea of a letter of proper submission ; and therefore , to make it easier to him , as he declared a much greater willingness to make mean concessions by word of mouth than on paper , it was resolved that , instead of writing to Fanny , he should go to London , and personally intreat her good offices in his favour .-- "" And if they really DO interest themselves ,"" said Marianne , in her new character of candour , "" in bringing about a reconciliation , I shall think that even John and Fanny are not entirely without merit ."""
austen#After a visit on Colonel Brandon ' s side of only three or four days , the two gentlemen quitted Barton together .-- They were to go immediately to Delaford , that Edward might have some personal knowledge of his future home , and assist his patron and friend in deciding on what improvements were needed to it ; and from thence , after staying there a couple of nights , he was to proceed on his journey to town . CHAPTER 50 After a proper resistance on the part of Mrs . Ferrars , just so violent and so steady as to preserve her from that reproach which she always seemed fearful of incurring , the reproach of being too amiable , Edward was admitted to her presence , and pronounced to be again her son . Her family had of late been exceedingly fluctuating . For many years of her life she had had two sons ; but the crime and annihilation of Edward a few weeks ago , had robbed her of one ; the similar annihilation of Robert had left her for a fortnight without any ; and now , by the resuscitation of Edward , she had one again . In spite of his being allowed once more to live , however , he did not feel the continuance of his existence secure , till he had revealed his present engagement ; for the publication of that circumstance , he feared , might give a sudden turn to his constitution , and carry him off as rapidly as before .
austen#With apprehensive caution therefore it was revealed , and he was listened to with unexpected calmness . Mrs . Ferrars at first reasonably endeavoured to dissuade him from marrying Miss Dashwood , by every argument in her power ;-- told him , that in Miss Morton he would have a woman of higher rank and larger fortune ;-- and enforced the assertion , by observing that Miss Morton was the daughter of a nobleman with thirty thousand pounds , while Miss Dashwood was only the daughter of a private gentleman with no more than THREE ; but when she found that , though perfectly admitting the truth of her representation , he was by no means inclined to be guided by it , she judged it wisest , from the experience of the past , to submit -- and therefore , after such an ungracious delay as she owed to her own dignity , and as served to prevent every suspicion of good - will , she issued her decree of consent to the marriage of Edward and Elinor . What she would engage to do towards augmenting their income was next to be considered ; and here it plainly appeared , that though Edward was now her only son , he was by no means her eldest ; for while Robert was inevitably endowed with a thousand pounds a - year , not the smallest objection was made against Edward ' s taking orders for the sake of two hundred and fifty at the utmost ; nor was anything promised either for the present or in future , beyond the ten thousand pounds , which had been given with Fanny . It was as much , however , as was desired , and more than was expected , by Edward and Elinor ; and Mrs . Ferrars herself , by her shuffling excuses , seemed the only person surprised at her not giving more . With an income quite sufficient to their wants thus secured to them , they had nothing to wait for after Edward was in possession of the living , but the readiness of the house , to which Colonel Brandon , with an eager desire for the accommodation of Elinor , was making considerable improvements ; and after waiting some time for their completion , after experiencing , as usual , a thousand disappointments and delays from the unaccountable dilatoriness of the workmen , Elinor , as usual , broke through the first positive resolution of not marrying till every thing was ready , and the ceremony took place in Barton church early in the autumn . The first month after their marriage was spent with their friend at the Mansion - house ; from whence they could superintend the progress of the Parsonage , and direct every thing as they liked on the spot ;-- could chuse papers , project shrubberies , and invent a sweep .
austen#"Mrs . Jennings ' s prophecies , though rather jumbled together , were chiefly fulfilled ; for she was able to visit Edward and his wife in their Parsonage by Michaelmas , and she found in Elinor and her husband , as she really believed , one of the happiest couples in the world . They had in fact nothing to wish for , but the marriage of Colonel Brandon and Marianne , and rather better pasturage for their cows . They were visited on their first settling by almost all their relations and friends . Mrs . Ferrars came to inspect the happiness which she was almost ashamed of having authorised ; and even the Dashwoods were at the expense of a journey from Sussex to do them honour . "" I will not say that I am disappointed , my dear sister ,"" said John , as they were walking together one morning before the gates of Delaford House , "" THAT would be saying too much , for certainly you have been one of the most fortunate young women in the world , as it is . But , I confess , it would give me great pleasure to call Colonel Brandon brother ."
austen#"His property here , his place , his house , every thing is in such respectable and excellent condition !-- and his woods !-- I have not seen such timber any where in Dorsetshire , as there is now standing in Delaford Hanger !-- And though , perhaps , Marianne may not seem exactly the person to attract him -- yet I think it would altogether be advisable for you to have them now frequently staying with you , for as Colonel Brandon seems a great deal at home , nobody can tell what may happen -- for , when people are much thrown together , and see little of anybody else -- and it will always be in your power to set her off to advantage , and so forth ;-- in short , you may as well give her a chance -- You understand me ."" -- But though Mrs . Ferrars DID come to see them , and always treated them with the make - believe of decent affection , they were never insulted by her real favour and preference . THAT was due to the folly of Robert , and the cunning of his wife ; and it was earned by them before many months had passed away . The selfish sagacity of the latter , which had at first drawn Robert into the scrape , was the principal instrument of his deliverance from it ; for her respectful humility , assiduous attentions , and endless flatteries , as soon as the smallest opening was given for their exercise , reconciled Mrs . Ferrars to his choice , and re - established him completely in her favour . The whole of Lucy ' s behaviour in the affair , and the prosperity which crowned it , therefore , may be held forth as a most encouraging instance of what an earnest , an unceasing attention to self - interest , however its progress may be apparently obstructed , will do in securing every advantage of fortune , with no other sacrifice than that of time and conscience ."
austen#When Robert first sought her acquaintance , and privately visited her in Bartlett ' s Buildings , it was only with the view imputed to him by his brother . He merely meant to persuade her to give up the engagement ; and as there could be nothing to overcome but the affection of both , he naturally expected that one or two interviews would settle the matter . In that point , however , and that only , he erred ;-- for though Lucy soon gave him hopes that his eloquence would convince her in TIME , another visit , another conversation , was always wanted to produce this conviction . Some doubts always lingered in her mind when they parted , which could only be removed by another half hour ' s discourse with himself . His attendance was by this means secured , and the rest followed in course . Instead of talking of Edward , they came gradually to talk only of Robert ,-- a subject on which he had always more to say than on any other , and in which she soon betrayed an interest even equal to his own ; and in short , it became speedily evident to both , that he had entirely supplanted his brother .
austen#He was proud of his conquest , proud of tricking Edward , and very proud of marrying privately without his mother ' s consent . What immediately followed is known . They passed some months in great happiness at Dawlish ; for she had many relations and old acquaintances to cut -- and he drew several plans for magnificent cottages ;-- and from thence returning to town , procured the forgiveness of Mrs . Ferrars , by the simple expedient of asking it , which , at Lucy ' s instigation , was adopted . The forgiveness , at first , indeed , as was reasonable , comprehended only Robert ; and Lucy , who had owed his mother no duty and therefore could have transgressed none , still remained some weeks longer unpardoned . But perseverance in humility of conduct and messages , in self - condemnation for Robert ' s offence , and gratitude for the unkindness she was treated with , procured her in time the haughty notice which overcame her by its graciousness , and led soon afterwards , by rapid degrees , to the highest state of affection and influence . Lucy became as necessary to Mrs . Ferrars , as either Robert or Fanny ; and while Edward was never cordially forgiven for having once intended to marry her , and Elinor , though superior to her in fortune and birth , was spoken of as an intruder , SHE was in every thing considered , and always openly acknowledged , to be a favourite child .
austen#They settled in town , received very liberal assistance from Mrs . Ferrars , were on the best terms imaginable with the Dashwoods ; and setting aside the jealousies and ill - will continually subsisting between Fanny and Lucy , in which their husbands of course took a part , as well as the frequent domestic disagreements between Robert and Lucy themselves , nothing could exceed the harmony in which they all lived together . What Edward had done to forfeit the right of eldest son , might have puzzled many people to find out ; and what Robert had done to succeed to it , might have puzzled them still more . It was an arrangement , however , justified in its effects , if not in its cause ; for nothing ever appeared in Robert ' s style of living or of talking to give a suspicion of his regretting the extent of his income , as either leaving his brother too little , or bringing himself too much ;-- and if Edward might be judged from the ready discharge of his duties in every particular , from an increasing attachment to his wife and his home , and from the regular cheerfulness of his spirits , he might be supposed no less contented with his lot , no less free from every wish of an exchange . Elinor ' s marriage divided her as little from her family as could well be contrived , without rendering the cottage at Barton entirely useless , for her mother and sisters spent much more than half their time with her . Mrs . Dashwood was acting on motives of policy as well as pleasure in the frequency of her visits at Delaford ; for her wish of bringing Marianne and Colonel Brandon together was hardly less earnest , though rather more liberal than what John had expressed . It was now her darling object .
austen#Precious as was the company of her daughter to her , she desired nothing so much as to give up its constant enjoyment to her valued friend ; and to see Marianne settled at the mansion - house was equally the wish of Edward and Elinor . They each felt his sorrows , and their own obligations , and Marianne , by general consent , was to be the reward of all . With such a confederacy against her -- with a knowledge so intimate of his goodness -- with a conviction of his fond attachment to herself , which at last , though long after it was observable to everybody else -- burst on her -- what could she do ? Marianne Dashwood was born to an extraordinary fate . She was born to discover the falsehood of her own opinions , and to counteract , by her conduct , her most favourite maxims . She was born to overcome an affection formed so late in life as at seventeen , and with no sentiment superior to strong esteem and lively friendship , voluntarily to give her hand to another !-- and THAT other , a man who had suffered no less than herself under the event of a former attachment , whom , two years before , she had considered too old to be married ,-- and who still sought the constitutional safeguard of a flannel waistcoat !
austen#But so it was . Instead of falling a sacrifice to an irresistible passion , as once she had fondly flattered herself with expecting ,-- instead of remaining even for ever with her mother , and finding her only pleasures in retirement and study , as afterwards in her more calm and sober judgment she had determined on ,-- she found herself at nineteen , submitting to new attachments , entering on new duties , placed in a new home , a wife , the mistress of a family , and the patroness of a village . Colonel Brandon was now as happy , as all those who best loved him , believed he deserved to be ;-- in Marianne he was consoled for every past affliction ;-- her regard and her society restored his mind to animation , and his spirits to cheerfulness ; and that Marianne found her own happiness in forming his , was equally the persuasion and delight of each observing friend . Marianne could never love by halves ; and her whole heart became , in time , as much devoted to her husband , as it had once been to Willoughby . Willoughby could not hear of her marriage without a pang ; and his punishment was soon afterwards complete in the voluntary forgiveness of Mrs . Smith , who , by stating his marriage with a woman of character , as the source of her clemency , gave him reason for believing that had he behaved with honour towards Marianne , he might at once have been happy and rich . That his repentance of misconduct , which thus brought its own punishment , was sincere , need not be doubted ;-- nor that he long thought of Colonel Brandon with envy , and of Marianne with regret .
austen#But that he was for ever inconsolable , that he fled from society , or contracted an habitual gloom of temper , or died of a broken heart , must not be depended on -- for he did neither . He lived to exert , and frequently to enjoy himself . His wife was not always out of humour , nor his home always uncomfortable ; and in his breed of horses and dogs , and in sporting of every kind , he found no inconsiderable degree of domestic felicity . For Marianne , however -- in spite of his incivility in surviving her loss -- he always retained that decided regard which interested him in every thing that befell her , and made her his secret standard of perfection in woman ;-- and many a rising beauty would be slighted by him in after - days as bearing no comparison with Mrs . Brandon . Mrs . Dashwood was prudent enough to remain at the cottage , without attempting a removal to Delaford ; and fortunately for Sir John and Mrs . Jennings , when Marianne was taken from them , Margaret had reached an age highly suitable for dancing , and not very ineligible for being supposed to have a lover . Between Barton and Delaford , there was that constant communication which strong family affection would naturally dictate ;-- and among the merits and the happiness of Elinor and Marianne , let it not be ranked as the least considerable , that though sisters , and living almost within sight of each other , they could live without disagreement between themselves , or producing coolness between their husbands .
austen#THE END
chesterton#"The man with the cloven chin seemed to have a singular power of understanding thoughts ; for , as Turnbull felt the whole universe tilt and turn over his head , the stranger said exactly the right thing . "" Doesn ' t it seem as if everything were being upset ?"" said he ; "" and if once everything is upset , He will be upset on top of it ."" Then , as Turnbull made no answer , his host continued : "" That is the really fine thing about space . It is topsy - turvy ."
chesterton#"You have only to climb far enough towards the morning star to feel that you are coming down to it . You have only to dive deep enough into the abyss to feel that you are rising . That is the only glory of this universe -- it is a giddy universe ."" Then , as Turnbull was still silent , he added : "" The heavens are full of revolution -- of the real sort of revolution . All the high things are sinking low and all the big things looking small ."
chesterton#"All the people who think they are aspiring find they are falling head foremost . And all the people who think they are condescending find they are climbing up a precipice . That is the intoxication of space . That is the only joy of eternity -- doubt . There is only one pleasure the angels can possibly have in flying , and that is , that they do not know whether they are on their head or their heels ."" Then , finding his companion still mute , he fell himself into a smiling and motionless meditation , at the end of which he said suddenly :"
chesterton#""" So MacIan converted you ?"" Turnbull sprang up as if spurning the steel car from under his feet . "" Converted me !"" he cried . "" What the devil do you mean ? I have known him for a month , and I have not retracted a single ----"""
chesterton#""" This Catholicism is a curious thing ,"" said the man of the cloven chin in uninterrupted reflectiveness , leaning his elegant elbows over the edge of the vessel ; "" it soaks and weakens men without their knowing it , just as I fear it has soaked and weakened you ."" Turnbull stood in an attitude which might well have meant pitching the other man out of the flying ship . "" I am an atheist ,"" he said , in a stifled voice . "" I have always been an atheist . I am still an atheist ."" Then , addressing the other ' s indolent and indifferent back , he cried : "" In God ' s name what do you mean ?"""
chesterton#"And the other answered without turning round : "" I mean nothing in God ' s name ."" Turnbull spat over the edge of the car and fell back furiously into his seat . The other continued still unruffled , and staring over the edge idly as an angler stares down at a stream . "" The truth is that we never thought that you could have been caught ,"" he said ; "" we counted on you as the one red - hot revolutionary left in the world . But , of course , these men like MacIan are awfully clever , especially when they pretend to be stupid ."""
chesterton#"Turnbull leapt up again in a living fury and cried : "" What have I got to do with MacIan ? I believe all I ever believed , and disbelieve all I ever disbelieved . What does all this mean , and what do you want with me here ?"" Then for the first time the other lifted himself from the edge of the car and faced him . "" I have brought you here ,"" he answered , "" to take part in the last war of the world ."" "" The last war !"""
chesterton#"repeated Turnbull , even in his dazed state a little touchy about such a dogma ; "" how do you know it will be the last ?"" The man laid himself back in his reposeful attitude , and said : "" It is the last war , because if it does not cure the world for ever , it will destroy it ."" "" What do you mean ?"" "" I only mean what you mean ,"" answered the unknown in a temperate voice . "" What was it that you always meant on those million and one nights when you walked outside your Ludgate Hill shop and shook your hand in the air ?"""
chesterton#""" Still I do not see ,"" said Turnbull , stubbornly . "" You will soon ,"" said the other , and abruptly bent downward one iron handle of his huge machine . The engine stopped , stooped , and dived almost as deliberately as a man bathing ; in their downward rush they swept within fifty yards of a big bulk of stone that Turnbull knew only too well . The last red anger of the sunset was ended ; the dome of heaven was dark ; the lanes of flaring light in the streets below hardly lit up the base of the building . But he saw that it was St . Paul ' s Cathedral , and he saw that on the top of it the ball was still standing erect , but the cross was stricken and had fallen sideways . Then only he cared to look down into the streets , and saw that they were inflamed with uproar and tossing passions ."
chesterton#""" We arrive at a happy moment ,"" said the man steering the ship . "" The insurgents are bombarding the city , and a cannon - ball has just hit the cross . Many of the insurgents are simple people , and they naturally regard it as a happy omen ."" "" Quite so ,"" said Turnbull , in a rather colourless voice . "" Yes ,"" replied the other . "" I thought you would be glad to see your prayer answered ."
chesterton#"Of course I apologize for the word prayer ."" "" Don ' t mention it ,"" said Turnbull . The flying ship had come down upon a sort of curve , and was now rising again . The higher and higher it rose the broader and broader became the scenes of flame and desolation underneath . Ludgate Hill indeed had been an uncaptured and comparatively quiet height , altered only by the startling coincidence of the cross fallen awry . All the other thoroughfares on all sides of that hill were full of the pulsation and the pain of battle , full of shaking torches and shouting faces ."
chesterton#"When at length they had risen high enough to have a bird ' s - eye view of the whole campaign , Turnbull was already intoxicated . He had smelt gunpowder , which was the incense of his own revolutionary religion . "" Have the people really risen ?"" he asked , breathlessly . "" What are they fighting about ?"" "" The programme is rather elaborate ,"" said his entertainer with some indifference ."
chesterton#""" I think Dr . Hertz drew it up ."" Turnbull wrinkled his forehead . "" Are all the poor people with the Revolution ?"" he asked . The other shrugged his shoulders . "" All the instructed and class - conscious part of them without exception ,"" he replied ."
chesterton#""" There were certainly a few districts ; in fact , we are passing over them just now ----"" Turnbull looked down and saw that the polished car was literally lit up from underneath by the far - flung fires from below . Underneath whole squares and solid districts were in flames , like prairies or forests on fire . "" Dr . Hertz has convinced everybody ,"" said Turnbull ' s cicerone in a smooth voice , "" that nothing can really be done with the real slums . His celebrated maxim has been quite adopted . I mean the three celebrated sentences : ' No man should be unemployed ."
chesterton#"Employ the employables . Destroy the unemployables .'"" There was a silence , and then Turnbull said in a rather strained voice : "" And do I understand that this good work is going on under here ?"" "" Going on splendidly ,"" replied his companion in the heartiest voice . "" You see , these people were much too tired and weak even to join the social war . They were a definite hindrance to it ."""
chesterton#""" And so you are simply burning them out ?"" "" It _does_ seem absurdly simple ,"" said the man , with a beaming smile , "" when one thinks of all the worry and talk about helping a hopeless slave population , when the future obviously was only crying to be rid of them . There are happy babes unborn ready to burst the doors when these drivellers are swept away ."" "" Will you permit me to say ,"" said Turnbull , after reflection , "" that I don ' t like all this ?"" "" And will you permit me to say ,"" said the other , with a snap , "" that I don ' t like Mr . Evan MacIan ?"" Somewhat to the speaker ' s surprise this did not inflame the sensitive sceptic ; he had the air of thinking thoroughly , and then he said : "" No , I don ' t think it ' s my friend MacIan that taught me that ."
chesterton#"I think I should always have said that I don ' t like this . These people have rights ."" "" Rights !"" repeated the unknown in a tone quite indescribable . Then he added with a more open sneer : "" Perhaps they also have souls ."" "" They have lives !"""
chesterton#"said Turnbull , sternly ; "" that is quite enough for me . I understood you to say that you thought life sacred ."" "" Yes , indeed !"" cried his mentor with a sort of idealistic animation . "" Yes , indeed ! Life is sacred -- but lives are not sacred ."
chesterton#"We are improving Life by removing lives . Can you , as a free - thinker , find any fault in that ?"" "" Yes ,"" said Turnbull with brevity . "" Yet you applaud tyrannicide ,"" said the stranger with rationalistic gaiety . "" How inconsistent ! It really comes to this : You approve of taking away life from those to whom it is a triumph and a pleasure ."
chesterton#"But you will not take away life from those to whom it is a burden and a toil ."" Turnbull rose to his feet in the car with considerable deliberation , but his face seemed oddly pale . The other went on with enthusiasm . "" Life , yes , Life is indeed sacred !"" he cried ; "" but new lives for old ! Good lives for bad !"
chesterton#"On that very place where now there sprawls one drunken wastrel of a pavement artist more or less wishing he were dead -- on that very spot there shall in the future be living pictures ; there shall be golden girls and boys leaping in the sun ."" Turnbull , still standing up , opened his lips . "" Will you put me down , please ?"" he said , quite calmly , like on stopping an omnibus . "" Put you down -- what do you mean ?"" cried his leader ."
chesterton#""" I am taking you to the front of the revolutionary war , where you will be one of the first of the revolutionary leaders ."" "" Thank you ,"" replied Turnbull with the same painful constraint . "" I have heard about your revolutionary war , and I think on the whole that I would rather be anywhere else ."" "" Do you want to be taken to a monastery ,"" snarled the other , "" with MacIan and his winking Madonnas ."" "" I want to be taken to a madhouse ,"" said Turnbull distinctly , giving the direction with a sort of precision . "" I want to go back to exactly the same lunatic asylum from which I came ."""
chesterton#""" Why ?"" asked the unknown . "" Because I want a little sane and wholesome society ,"" answered Turnbull . There was a long and peculiar silence , and then the man driving the flying machine said quite coolly : "" I won ' t take you back ."" And then Turnbull said equally coolly : "" Then I ' ll jump out of the car ."" The unknown rose to his full height , and the expression in his eyes seemed to be made of ironies behind ironies , as two mirrors infinitely reflect each other ."
chesterton#"At last he said , very gravely : "" Do you think I am the devil ?"" "" Yes ,"" said Turnbull , violently . "" For I think the devil is a dream , and so are you . I don ' t believe in you or your flying ship or your last fight of the world . It is all a nightmare . I say as a fact of dogma and faith that it is all a nightmare ."
chesterton#"And I will be a martyr for my faith as much as St . Catherine , for I will jump out of this ship and risk waking up safe in bed ."" After swaying twice with the swaying vessel he dived over the side as one dives into the sea . For some incredible moments stars and space and planets seemed to shoot up past him as the sparks fly upward ; and yet in that sickening descent he was full of some unnatural happiness . He could connect it with no idea except one that half escaped him -- what Evan had said of the difference between Christ and Satan ; that it was by Christ ' s own choice that He descended into hell . When he again realized anything , he was lying on his elbow on the lawn of the lunatic asylum , and the last red of the sunset had not yet disappeared . XVII ."
chesterton#THE IDIOT Evan MacIan was standing a few yards off looking at him in absolute silence . He had not the moral courage to ask MacIan if there had been anything astounding in the manner of his coming there , nor did MacIan seem to have any question to ask , or perhaps any need to ask it . The two men came slowly towards each other , and found the same expression on each other ' s faces . Then , for the first time in all their acquaintance , they shook hands . Almost as if this were a kind of unconscious signal , it brought Dr . Quayle bounding out of a door and running across the lawn .
chesterton#""" Oh , there you are !"" he exclaimed with a relieved giggle . "" Will you come inside , please ? I want to speak to you both ."" They followed him into his shiny wooden office where their damning record was kept . Dr . Quayle sat down on a swivel chair and swung round to face them ."
chesterton#"His carved smile had suddenly disappeared . "" I will be plain with you gentlemen ,"" he said , abruptly ; "" you know quite well we do our best for everybody here . Your cases have been under special consideration , and the Master himself has decided that you ought to be treated specially and -- er -- under somewhat simpler conditions ."" "" You mean treated worse , I suppose ,"" said Turnbull , gruffly . The doctor did not reply , and MacIan said : "" I expected this ."" His eyes had begun to glow ."
chesterton#"The doctor answered , looking at his desk and playing with a key : "" Well , in certain cases that give anxiety -- it is often better ----"" "" Give anxiety ,"" said Turnbull , fiercely . "" Confound your impudence ! What do you mean ? You imprison two perfectly sane men in a madhouse because you have made up a long word . They take it in good temper , walk and talk in your garden like monks who have found a vocation , are civil even to you , you damned druggists ' hack !"
chesterton#"Behave not only more sanely than any of your patients , but more sanely than half the sane men outside , and you have the soul - stifling cheek to say that they give anxiety ."" "" The head of the asylum has settled it all ,"" said Dr . Quayle , still looking down . MacIan took one of his immense strides forward and stood over the doctor with flaming eyes . "" If the head has settled it let the head announce it ,"" he said . "" I won ' t take it from you . I believe you to be a low , gibbering degenerate ."
chesterton#"Let us see the head of the asylum ."" "" See the head of the asylum ,"" repeated Dr . Quayle . "" Certainly not ."" The tall Highlander , bending over him , put one hand on his shoulder with fatherly interest . "" You don ' t seem to appreciate the peculiar advantages of my position as a lunatic ,"" he said . "" I could kill you with my left hand before such a rat as you could so much as squeak ."
chesterton#"And I wouldn ' t be hanged for it ."" "" I certainly agree with Mr . MacIan ,"" said Turnbull with sobriety and perfect respectfulness , "" that you had better let us see the head of the institution ."" Dr . Quayle got to his feet in a mixture of sudden hysteria and clumsy presence of mind . "" Oh , certainly ,"" he said with a weak laugh . "" You can see the head of the asylum if you particularly want to ."" He almost ran out of the room , and the two followed swiftly on his flying coat tails ."
chesterton#"He knocked at an ordinary varnished door in the corridor . When a voice said , "" Come in ,"" MacIan ' s breath went hissing back through his teeth into his chest . Turnbull was more impetuous , and opened the door . It was a neat and well - appointed room entirely lined with a medical library . At the other end of it was a ponderous and polished desk with an incandescent lamp on it , the light of which was just sufficient to show a slender , well - bred figure in an ordinary medical black frock - coat , whose head , quite silvered with age , was bent over neat piles of notes . This gentleman looked up for an instant as they entered , and the lamplight fell on his glittering spectacles and long , clean - shaven face -- a face which would have been simply like an aristocrat ' s but that a certain lion poise of the head and long cleft in the chin made it look more like a very handsome actor ' s ."
chesterton#"It was only for a flash that his face was thus lifted . Then he bent his silver head over his notes once more , and said , without looking up again : "" I told you , Dr . Quayle , that these men were to go to cells B and C ."" Turnbull and MacIan looked at each other , and said more than they could ever say with tongues or swords . Among other things they said that to that particular Head of the institution it was a waste of time to appeal , and they followed Dr . Quayle out of the room . The instant they stepped out into the corridor four sturdy figures stepped from four sides , pinioned them , and ran them along the galleries ."
chesterton#They might very likely have thrown their captors right and left had they been inclined to resist , but for some nameless reason they were more inclined to laugh . A mixture of mad irony with childish curiosity made them feel quite inclined to see what next twist would be taken by their imbecile luck . They were dragged down countless cold avenues lined with glazed tiles , different only in being of different lengths and set at different angles . They were so many and so monotonous that to escape back by them would have been far harder than fleeing from the Hampton Court maze . Only the fact that windows grew fewer , coming at longer intervals , and the fact that when the windows did come they seemed shadowed and let in less light , showed that they were winding into the core or belly of some enormous building . After a little time the glazed corridors began to be lit by electricity .
chesterton#"At last , when they had walked nearly a mile in those white and polished tunnels , they came with quite a shock to the futile finality of a cul - de - sac . All that white and weary journey ended suddenly in an oblong space and a blank white wall . But in the white wall there were two iron doors painted white on which were written , respectively , in neat black capitals B and C . "" You go in here , sir ,"" said the leader of the officials , quite respectfully , "" and you in here ."" But before the doors had clanged upon their dazed victims , MacIan had been able to say to Turnbull with a strange drawl of significance : "" I wonder who A is ."" Turnbull made an automatic struggle before he allowed himself to be thrown into the cell ."
chesterton#Hence it happened that he was the last to enter , and was still full of the exhilaration of the adventures for at least five minutes after the echo of the clanging door had died away . Then , when silence had sunk deep and nothing happened for two and a half hours , it suddenly occurred to him that this was the end of his life . He was hidden and sealed up in this little crack of stone until the flesh should fall off his bones . He was dead , and the world had won . His cell was of an oblong shape , but very long in comparison with its width . It was just wide enough to permit the arms to be fully extended with the dumb - bells , which were hung up on the left wall , very dusty .
chesterton#It was , however , long enough for a man to walk one thirty - fifth part of a mile if he traversed it entirely . On the same principle a row of fixed holes , quite close together , let in to the cells by pipes what was alleged to be the freshest air . For these great scientific organizers insisted that a man should be healthy even if he was miserable . They provided a walk long enough to give him exercise and holes large enough to give him oxygen . There their interest in human nature suddenly ceased . It seemed never to have occurred to them that the benefit of exercise belongs partly to the benefit of liberty .
chesterton#They had not entertained the suggestion that the open air is only one of the advantages of the open sky . They administered air in secret , but in sufficient doses , as if it were a medicine . They suggested walking , as if no man had ever felt inclined to walk . Above all , the asylum authorities insisted on their own extraordinary cleanliness . Every morning , while Turnbull was still half asleep on his iron bedstead which was lifted half - way up the wall and clamped to it with iron , four sluices or metal mouths opened above him at the four corners of the chamber and washed it white of any defilement . Turnbull ' s solitary soul surged up against this sickening daily solemnity .
chesterton#""" I am buried alive !"" he cried , bitterly ; "" they have hidden me under mountains . I shall be here till I rot . Why the blazes should it matter to them whether I am dirty or clean ."" Every morning and evening an iron hatchway opened in his oblong cell , and a brown hairy hand or two thrust in a plate of perfectly cooked lentils and a big bowl of cocoa . He was not underfed any more than he was underexercised or asphyxiated ."
chesterton#He had ample walking space , ample air , ample and even filling food . The only objection was that he had nothing to walk towards , nothing to feast about , and no reason whatever for drawing the breath of life . Even the shape of his cell especially irritated him . It was a long , narrow parallelogram , which had a flat wall at one end and ought to have had a flat wall at the other ; but that end was broken by a wedge or angle of space , like the prow of a ship . After three days of silence and cocoa , this angle at the end began to infuriate Turnbull . It maddened him to think that two lines came together and pointed at nothing .
chesterton#After the fifth day he was reckless , and poked his head into the corner . After twenty - five days he almost broke his head against it . Then he became quite cool and stupid again , and began to examine it like a sort of Robinson Crusoe . Almost unconsciously it was his instinct to examine outlets , and he found himself paying particular attention to the row of holes which let in the air into his last house of life . He soon discovered that these air - holes were all the ends and mouths of long leaden tubes which doubtless carried air from some remote watering - place near Margate . One evening while he was engaged in the fifth investigation he noticed something like twilight in one of these dumb mouths , as compared with the darkness of the others .
chesterton#"Thrusting his finger in as far as it would go , he found a hole and flapping edge in the tube . This he rent open and instantly saw a light behind ; it was at least certain that he had struck some other cell . It is a characteristic of all things now called "" efficient "", which means mechanical and calculated , that if they go wrong at all they go entirely wrong . There is no power of retrieving a defeat , as in simpler and more living organisms . A strong gun can conquer a strong elephant , but a wounded elephant can easily conquer a broken gun . Thus the Prussian monarchy in the eighteenth century , or now , can make a strong army merely by making the men afraid ."
chesterton#But it does it with the permanent possibility that the men may some day be more afraid of their enemies than of their officers . Thus the drainage in our cities so long as it is quite solid means a general safety , but if there is one leak it means concentrated poison -- an explosion of deathly germs like dynamite , a spirit of stink . Thus , indeed , all that excellent machinery which is the swiftest thing on earth in saving human labour is also the slowest thing on earth in resisting human interference . It may be easier to get chocolate for nothing out of a shopkeeper than out of an automatic machine . But if you did manage to steal the chocolate , the automatic machine would be much less likely to run after you . Turnbull was not long in discovering this truth in connexion with the cold and colossal machinery of this great asylum .
chesterton#He had been shaken by many spiritual states since the instant when he was pitched head foremost into that private cell which was to be his private room till death . He had felt a high fit of pride and poetry , which had ebbed away and left him deadly cold . He had known a period of mere scientific curiosity , in the course of which he examined all the tiles of his cell , with the gratifying conclusion that they were all the same shape and size ; but was greatly puzzled about the angle in the wall at the end , and also about an iron peg or spike that stood out from the wall , the object of which he does not know to this day . Then he had a period of mere madness not to be written of by decent men , but only by those few dirty novelists hallooed on by the infernal huntsman to hunt down and humiliate human nature . This also passed , but left behind it a feverish distaste for many of the mere objects around him . Long after he had returned to sanity and such hopeless cheerfulness as a man might have on a desert island , he disliked the regular squares of the pattern of wall and floor and the triangle that terminated his corridor .
chesterton#Above all , he had a hatred , deep as the hell he did not believe in , for the objectless iron peg in the wall . But in all his moods , sane or insane , intolerant or stoical , he never really doubted this : that the machine held him as light and as hopelessly as he had from his birth been held by the hopeless cosmos of his own creed . He knew well the ruthless and inexhaustible resources of our scientific civilization . He no more expected rescue from a medical certificate than rescue from the solar system . In many of his Robinson Crusoe moods he thought kindly of MacIan as of some quarrelsome school - fellow who had long been dead . He thought of leaving in the cell when he died a rigid record of his opinions , and when he began to write them down on scraps of envelope in his pocket , he was startled to discover how much they had changed .
chesterton#Then he remembered the Beauchamp Tower , and tried to write his blazing scepticism on the wall , and discovered that it was all shiny tiles on which nothing could be either drawn or carved . Then for an instant there hung and broke above him like a high wave the whole horror of scientific imprisonment , which manages to deny a man not only liberty , but every accidental comfort of bondage . In the old filthy dungeons men could carve their prayers or protests in the rock . Here the white and slippery walls escaped even from bearing witness . The old prisoners could make a pet of a mouse or a beetle strayed out of a hole . Here the unpierceable walls were washed every morning by an automatic sluice .
chesterton#There was no natural corruption and no merciful decay by which a living thing could enter in . Then James Turnbull looked up and saw the high invincible hatefulness of the society in which he lived , and saw the hatefulness of something else also , which he told himself again and again was not the cosmos in which he believed . But all the time he had never once doubted that the five sides of his cell were for him the wall of the world henceforward , and it gave him a shock of surprise even to discover the faint light through the aperture in the ventilation tube . But he had forgotten how close efficiency has to pack everything together and how easily , therefore , a pipe here or there may leak . Turnbull thrust his first finger down the aperture , and at last managed to make a slight further fissure in the piping . The light that came up from beyond was very faint , and apparently indirect ; it seemed to fall from some hole or window higher up .
chesterton#"As he was screwing his eye to peer at this grey and greasy twilight he was astonished to see another human finger very long and lean come down from above towards the broken pipe and hook it up to something higher . The lighted aperture was abruptly blackened and blocked , presumably by a face and mouth , for something human spoke down the tube , though the words were not clear . "" Who is that ?"" asked Turnbull , trembling with excitement , yet wary and quite resolved not to spoil any chance . After a few indistinct sounds the voice came down with a strong Argyllshire accent : "" I say , Turnbull , we couldn ' t fight through this tube , could we ?"""
chesterton#"Sentiments beyond speech surged up in Turnbull and silenced him for a space just long enough to be painful . Then he said with his old gaiety : "" I vote we talk a little first ; I don ' t want to murder the first man I have met for ten million years ."" "" I know what you mean ,"" answered the other . "" It has been awful . For a mortal month I have been alone with God ."" Turnbull started , and it was on the tip of his tongue to answer : "" Alone with God !"
chesterton#"Then you do not know what loneliness is ."" But he answered , after all , in his old defiant style : "" Alone with God , were you ? And I suppose you found his Majesty ' s society rather monotonous ?"" "" Oh , no ,"" said MacIan , and his voice shuddered ; "" it was a great deal too exciting ."" After a very long silence the voice of MacIan said : "" What do you really hate most in your place ?"" "" You ' d think I was really mad if I told you ,"" answered Turnbull , bitterly ."
chesterton#""" Then I expect it ' s the same as mine ,"" said the other voice . "" I am sure it ' s not the same as anybody ' s ,"" said Turnbull , "" for it has no rhyme or reason . Perhaps my brain really has gone , but I detest that iron spike in the left wall more than the damned desolation or the damned cocoa . Have you got one in your cell ?"" "" Not now ,"" replied MacIan with serenity . "" I ' ve pulled it out ."""
chesterton#"His fellow - prisoner could only repeat the words . "" I pulled it out the other day when I was off my head ,"" continued the tranquil Highland voice . "" It looked so unnecessary ."" "" You must be ghastly strong ,"" said Turnbull . "" One is , when one is mad ,"" was the careless reply , "" and it had worn a little loose in the socket . Even now I ' ve got it out I can ' t discover what it was for ."
chesterton#"But I ' ve found out something a long sight funnier ."" "" What do you mean ?"" asked Turnbull . "" I have found out where A is ,"" said the other . Three weeks afterwards MacIan had managed to open up communications which made his meaning plain . By that time the two captives had fully discovered and demonstrated that weakness in the very nature of modern machinery to which we have already referred ."
chesterton#The very fact that they were isolated from all companions meant that they were free from all spies , and as there were no gaolers to be bribed , so there were none to be baffled . Machinery brought them their cocoa and cleaned their cells ; that machinery was as helpless as it was pitiless . A little patient violence , conducted day after day amid constant mutual suggestion , opened an irregular hole in the wall , large enough to let in a small man , in the exact place where there had been before the tiny ventilation holes . Turnbull tumbled somehow into MacIan ' s apartment , and his first glance found out that the iron spike was indeed plucked from its socket , and left , moreover , another ragged hole into some hollow place behind . But for this MacIan ' s cell was the duplicate of Turnbull ' s -- a long oblong ending in a wedge and lined with cold and lustrous tiles . The small hole from which the peg had been displaced was in that short oblique wall at the end nearest to Turnbull ' s .
chesterton#"That individual looked at it with a puzzled face . "" What is in there ?"" he asked . MacIan answered briefly : "" Another cell ."" "" But where can the door of it be ?"" said his companion , even more puzzled ; "" the doors of our cells are at the other end ."""
chesterton#""" It has no door ,"" said Evan . In the pause of perplexity that followed , an eerie and sinister feeling crept over Turnbull ' s stubborn soul in spite of himself . The notion of the doorless room chilled him with that sense of half - witted curiosity which one has when something horrible is half understood . "" James Turnbull ,"" said MacIan , in a low and shaken voice , "" these people hate us more than Nero hated Christians , and fear us more than any man feared Nero . They have filled England with frenzy and galloping in order to capture us and wipe us out -- in order to kill us . And they have killed us , for you and I have only made a hole in our coffins ."
chesterton#"But though this hatred that they felt for us is bigger than they felt for Bonaparte , and more plain and practical than they would feel for Jack the Ripper , yet it is not we whom the people of this place hate most ."" A cold and quivering impatience continued to crawl up Turnbull ' s spine ; he had never felt so near to superstition and supernaturalism , and it was not a pretty sort of superstition either . "" There is another man more fearful and hateful ,"" went on MacIan , in his low monotone voice , "" and they have buried him even deeper . God knows how they did it , for he was let in by neither door nor window , nor lowered through any opening above . I expect these iron handles that we both hate have been part of some damned machinery for walling him up . He is there ."
chesterton#"I have looked through the hole at him ; but I cannot stand looking at him long , because his face is turned away from me and he does not move ."" Al Turnbull ' s unnatural and uncompleted feelings found their outlet in rushing to the aperture and looking into the unknown room . It was a third oblong cell exactly like the other two except that it was doorless , and except that on one of the walls was painted a large black A like the B and C outside their own doors . The letter in this case was not painted outside , because this prison had no outside . On the same kind of tiled floor , of which the monotonous squares had maddened Turnbull ' s eye and brain , was sitting a figure which was startlingly short even for a child , only that the enormous head was ringed with hair of a frosty grey . The figure was draped , both insecurely and insufficiently , in what looked like the remains of a brown flannel dressing - gown ; an emptied cup of cocoa stood on the floor beside it , and the creature had his big grey head cocked at a particular angle of inquiry or attention which amid all that gathering gloom and mystery struck one as comic if not cocksure ."
chesterton#After six still seconds Turnbull could stand it no longer , but called out to the dwarfish thing -- in what words heaven knows . The thing got up with the promptitude of an animal , and turning round offered the spectacle of two owlish eyes and a huge grey - and - white beard not unlike the plumage of an owl . This extraordinary beard covered him literally to his feet ( not that that was very far ), and perhaps it was as well that it did , for portions of his remaining clothing seemed to fall off whenever he moved . One talks trivially of a face like parchment , but this old man ' s face was so wrinkled that it was like a parchment loaded with hieroglyphics . The lines of his face were so deep and complex that one could see five or ten different faces besides the real one , as one can see them in an elaborate wall - paper . And yet while his face seemed like a scripture older than the gods , his eyes were quite bright , blue , and startled like those of a baby .
chesterton#"They looked as if they had only an instant before been fitted into his head . Everything depended so obviously upon whether this buried monster spoke that Turnbull did not know or care whether he himself had spoken . He said something or nothing . And then he waited for this dwarfish voice that had been hidden under the mountains of the world . At last it did speak , and spoke in English , with a foreign accent that was neither Latin nor Teutonic . He suddenly stretched out a long and very dirty forefinger , and cried in a voice of clear recognition , like a child ' s : "" That ' s a hole ."""
chesterton#"He digested the discovery for some seconds , sucking his finger , and then he cried , with a crow of laughter : "" And that ' s a head come through it ."" The hilarious energy in this idiot attitude gave Turnbull another sick turn . He had grown to tolerate those dreary and mumbling madmen who trailed themselves about the beautiful asylum gardens . But there was something new and subversive of the universe in the combination of so much cheerful decision with a body without a brain . "" Why did they put you in such a place ?"" he asked at last with embarrassment ."
chesterton#""" Good place . Yes ,"" said the old man , nodding a great many times and beaming like a flattered landlord . "" Good shape . Long and narrow , with a point . Like this ,"" and he made lovingly with his hands a map of the room in the air . "" But that ' s not the best ,"" he added , confidentially ."
chesterton#""" Squares very good ; I have a nice long holiday , and can count them . But that ' s not the best ."" "" What is the best ?"" asked Turnbull in great distress . "" Spike is the best ,"" said the old man , opening his blue eyes blazing ; "" it sticks out ."" The words Turnbull spoke broke out of him in pure pity ."
chesterton#""" Can ' t we do anything for you ?"" he said . "" I am very happy ,"" said the other , alphabetically . "" You are a good man . Can I help you ?"" "" No , I don ' t think you can , sir ,"" said Turnbull with rough pathos ; "" I am glad you are contented at least ."""
chesterton#"The weird old person opened his broad blue eyes and fixed Turnbull with a stare extraordinarily severe . "" You are quite sure ,"" he said , "" I cannot help you ?"" "" Quite sure , thank you ,"" said Turnbull with broken brevity . "" Good day ."" Then he turned to MacIan who was standing close behind him , and whose face , now familiar in all its moods , told him easily that Evan had heard the whole of the strange dialogue . "" Curse those cruel beasts !"""
chesterton#"cried Turnbull . "" They ' ve turned him to an imbecile just by burying him alive . His brain ' s like a pin - point now ."" "" You are sure he is a lunatic ?"" said Evan , slowly . "" Not a lunatic ,"" said Turnbull , "" an idiot ."
chesterton#"He just points to things and says that they stick out ."" "" He had a notion that he could help us ,"" said MacIan moodily , and began to pace towards the other end of his cell . "" Yes , it was a bit pathetic ,"" assented Turnbull ; "" such a Thing offering help , and besides ---- Hallo ! Hallo ! What ' s the matter ?"" "" God Almighty guide us all !"""
chesterton#"said MacIan . He was standing heavy and still at the other end of the room and staring quietly at the door which for thirty days had sealed them up from the sun . Turnbull , following the other ' s eye , stared at the door likewise , and then he also uttered an exclamation . The iron door was standing about an inch and a half open . "" He said ----"" began Evan , in a trembling voice --"" he offered ----"" "" Come along , you fool !"""
chesterton#"shouted Turnbull with a sudden and furious energy . "" I see it all now , and it ' s the best stroke of luck in the world . You pulled out that iron handle that had screwed up his cell , and it somehow altered the machinery and opened all the doors ."" Seizing MacIan by the elbow he bundled him bodily out into the open corridor and ran him on till they saw daylight through a half - darkened window . "" All the same ,"" said Evan , like one answering in an ordinary conversation , "" he did ask you whether he could help you ."" All this wilderness of windowless passages was so built into the heart of that fortress of fear that it seemed more than an hour before the fugitives had any good glimpse of the outer world ."
chesterton#They did not even know what hour of the day it was ; and when , turning a corner , they saw the bare tunnel of the corridor end abruptly in a shining square of garden , the grass burning in that strong evening sunshine which makes it burnished gold rather than green , the abrupt opening on to the earth seemed like a hole knocked in the wall of heaven . Only once or twice in life is it permitted to a man thus to see the very universe from outside , and feel existence itself as an adorable adventure not yet begun . As they found this shining escape out of that hellish labyrinth they both had simultaneously the sensation of being babes unborn , of being asked by God if they would like to live upon the earth . They were looking in at one of the seven gates of Eden . Turnbull was the first to leap into the garden , with an earth - spurning leap like that of one who could really spread his wings and fly . MacIan , who came an instant after , was less full of mere animal gusto and fuller of a more fearful and quivering pleasure in the clear and innocent flower colours and the high and holy trees .
chesterton#"With one bound they were in that cool and cleared landscape , and they found just outside the door the black - clad gentleman with the cloven chin smilingly regarding them ; and his chin seemed to grow longer and longer as he smiled . XVIII . A RIDDLE OF FACES Just behind him stood two other doctors : one , the familiar Dr . Quayle , of the blinking eyes and bleating voice ; the other , a more commonplace but much more forcible figure , a stout young doctor with short , well - brushed hair and a round but resolute face . At the sight of the escape these two subordinates uttered a cry and sprang forward , but their superior remained motionless and smiling , and somehow the lack of his support seemed to arrest and freeze them in the very gesture of pursuit . "" Let them be ,"" he cried in a voice that cut like a blade of ice ; and not only of ice , but of some awful primordial ice that had never been water ."
chesterton#""" I want no devoted champions ,"" said the cutting voice ; "" even the folly of one ' s friends bores one at last . You don ' t suppose I should have let these lunatics out of their cells without good reason . I have the best and fullest reason . They can be let out of their cell today , because today the whole world has become their cell . I will have no more medieval mummery of chains and doors . Let them wander about the earth as they wandered about this garden , and I shall still be their easy master ."
chesterton#"Let them take the wings of the morning and abide in the uttermost parts of the sea -- I am there . Whither shall they go from my presence and whither shall they flee from my spirit ? Courage , Dr . Quayle , and do not be downhearted ; the real days of tyranny are only beginning on this earth ."" And with that the Master laughed and swung away from them , almost as if his laugh was a bad thing for people to see . "" Might I speak to you a moment ?"" said Turnbull , stepping forward with a respectful resolution ."
chesterton#"But the shoulders of the Master only seemed to take on a new and unexpected angle of mockery as he strode away . Turnbull swung round with great abruptness to the other two doctors , and said , harshly : "" What in snakes does he mean -- and who are you ?"" "" My name is Hutton ,"" said the short , stout man , "" and I am -- well , one of those whose business it is to uphold this establishment ."" "" My name is Turnbull ,"" said the other ; "" I am one of those whose business it is to tear it to the ground ."" The small doctor smiled , and Turnbull ' s anger seemed suddenly to steady him . "" But I don ' t want to talk about that ,"" he said , calmly ; "" I only want to know what the Master of this asylum really means ."""
chesterton#"Dr . Hutton ' s smile broke into a laugh which , short as it was , had the suspicion of a shake in it . "" I suppose you think that quite a simple question ,"" he said . "" I think it a plain question ,"" said Turnbull , "" and one that deserves a plain answer . Why did the Master lock us up in a couple of cupboards like jars of pickles for a mortal month , and why does he now let us walk free in the garden again ?"" "" I understand ,"" said Hutton , with arched eyebrows , "" that your complaint is that you are now free to walk in the garden ."" "" My complaint is ,"" said Turnbull , stubbornly , "" that if I am fit to walk freely now , I have been as fit for the last month ."
chesterton#"No one has examined me , no one has come near me . Your chief says that I am only free because he has made other arrangements . What are those arrangements ?"" The young man with the round face looked down for a little while and smoked reflectively . The other and elder doctor had gone pacing nervously by himself upon the lawn . At length the round face was lifted again , and showed two round blue eyes with a certain frankness in them ."
chesterton#""" Well , I don ' t see that it can do any harm to tell you know ,"" he said . "" You were shut up just then because it was just during that month that the Master was bringing off his big scheme . He was getting his bill through Parliament , and organizing the new medical police . But of course you haven ' t heard of all that ; in fact , you weren ' t meant to ."" "" Heard of all what ?"" asked the impatient inquirer ."
chesterton#""" There ' s a new law now , and the asylum powers are greatly extended . Even if you did escape now , any policeman would take you up in the next town if you couldn ' t show a certificate of sanity from us ."" "" Well ,"" continued Dr . Hutton , "" the Master described before both Houses of Parliament the real scientific objection to all existing legislation about lunacy . As he very truly said , the mistake was in supposing insanity to be merely an exception or an extreme . Insanity , like forgetfulness , is simply a quality which enters more or less into all human beings ; and for practical purposes it is more necessary to know whose mind is really trustworthy than whose has some accidental taint . We have therefore reversed the existing method , and people now have to prove that they are sane ."
chesterton#"In the first village you entered , the village constable would notice that you were not wearing on the left lapel of your coat the small pewter S which is now necessary to any one who walks about beyond asylum bounds or outside asylum hours ."" "" You mean to say ,"" said Turnbull , "" that this was what the Master of the asylum urged before the House of Commons ?"" Dr . Hutton nodded with gravity . "" And you mean to say ,"" cried Turnbull , with a vibrant snort , "" that that proposal was passed in an assembly that calls itself democratic ?"" The doctor showed his whole row of teeth in a smile . "" Oh , the assembly calls itself Socialist now ,"" he said , "" But we explained to them that this was a question for men of science ."""
chesterton#"Turnbull gave one stamp upon the gravel , then pulled himself together , and resumed : "" But why should your infernal head medicine - man lock us up in separate cells while he was turning England into a madhouse ? I ' m not the Prime Minister ; we ' re not the House of Lords ."" "" He wasn ' t afraid of the Prime Minister ,"" replied Dr . Hutton ; "" he isn ' t afraid of the House of Lords . But ----"" "" Well ?"" inquired Turnbull , stamping again ."
chesterton#""" He is afraid of you ,"" said Hutton , simply . "" Why , didn ' t you know ?"" MacIan , who had not spoken yet , made one stride forward and stood with shaking limbs and shining eyes . "" He was afraid !"" began Evan , thickly . "" You mean to say that we ----"""
chesterton#""" I mean to say the plain truth now that the danger is over ,"" said Hutton , calmly ; "" most certainly you two were the only people he ever was afraid of ."" Then he added in a low but not inaudible voice : "" Except one -- whom he feared worse , and has buried deeper ."" "" Come away ,"" cried MacIan , "" this has to be thought about ."" Turnbull followed him in silence as he strode away , but just before he vanished , turned and spoke again to the doctors . "" But what has got hold of people ?"" he asked , abruptly ."
chesterton#""" Why should all England have gone dotty on the mere subject of dottiness ?"" Dr . Hutton smiled his open smile once more and bowed slightly . "" As to that also ,"" he replied , "" I don ' t want to make you vain ."" Turnbull swung round without a word , and he and his companion were lost in the lustrous leafage of the garden . They noticed nothing special about the scene , except that the garden seemed more exquisite than ever in the deepening sunset , and that there seemed to be many more people , whether patients or attendants , walking about in it . From behind the two black - coated doctors as they stood on the lawn another figure somewhat similarly dressed strode hurriedly past them , having also grizzled hair and an open flapping frock - coat ."
chesterton#Both his decisive step and dapper black array marked him out as another medical man , or at least a man in authority , and as he passed Turnbull the latter was aroused by a strong impression of having seen the man somewhere before . It was no one that he knew well , yet he was certain that it was someone at whom he had at sometime or other looked steadily . It was neither the face of a friend nor of an enemy ; it aroused neither irritation nor tenderness , yet it was a face which had for some reason been of great importance in his life . Turning and returning , and making detours about the garden , he managed to study the man ' s face again and again -- a moustached , somewhat military face with a monocle , the sort of face that is aristocratic without being distinguished . Turnbull could not remember any particular doctors in his decidedly healthy existence . Was the man a long - lost uncle , or was he only somebody who had sat opposite him regularly in a railway train ?
chesterton#At that moment the man knocked down his own eye - glass with a gesture of annoyance ; Turnbull remembered the gesture , and the truth sprang up solid in front of him . The man with the moustaches was Cumberland Vane , the London police magistrate before whom he and MacIan had once stood on their trial . The magistrate must have been transferred to some other official duties -- to something connected with the inspection of asylums . Turnbull ' s heart gave a leap of excitement which was half hope . As a magistrate Mr . Cumberland Vane had been somewhat careless and shallow , but certainly kindly , and not inaccessible to common sense so long as it was put to him in strictly conventional language . He was at least an authority of a more human and refreshing sort than the crank with the wagging beard or the fiend with the forked chin .
chesterton#"He went straight up to the magistrate , and said : "" Good evening , Mr . Vane ; I doubt if you remember me ."" Cumberland Vane screwed the eye - glass into his scowling face for an instant , and then said curtly but not uncivilly : "" Yes , I remember you , sir ; assault or battery , wasn ' t it ?-- a fellow broke your window . A tall fellow -- McSomething -- case made rather a noise afterwards ."" "" MacIan is the name , sir ,"" said Turnbull , respectfully ; "" I have him here with me ."" "" Eh !"" said Vane very sharply ."
chesterton#""" Confound him ! Has he got anything to do with this game ?"" "" Mr . Vane ,"" said Turnbull , pacifically , "" I will not pretend that either he or I acted quite decorously on that occasion . You were very lenient with us , and did not treat us as criminals when you very well might . So I am sure you will give us your testimony that , even if we were criminals , we are not lunatics in any legal or medical sense whatever . I am sure you will use your influence for us ."""
chesterton#""" My influence !"" repeated the magistrate , with a slight start . "" I don ' t quite understand you ."" "" I don ' t know in what capacity you are here ,"" continued Turnbull , gravely , "" but a legal authority of your distinction must certainly be here in an important one . Whether you are visiting and inspecting the place , or attached to it as some kind of permanent legal adviser , your opinion must still ----"" Cumberland Vane exploded with a detonation of oaths ; his face was transfigured with fury and contempt , and yet in some odd way he did not seem specially angry with Turnbull ."
chesterton#""" But Lord bless us and save us !"" he gasped , at length ; "" I ' m not here as an official at all . I ' m here as a patient . The cursed pack of rat - catching chemists all say that I ' ve lost my wits ."" "" You !"" cried Turnbull with terrible emphasis ."
chesterton#""" You ! Lost your wits !"" In the rush of his real astonishment at this towering unreality Turnbull almost added : "" Why , you haven ' t got any to lose ."" But he fortunately remembered the remains of his desperate diplomacy . "" This can ' t go on ,"" he said , positively . "" Men like MacIan and I may suffer unjustly all our lives , but a man like you must have influence ."""
chesterton#""" There is only one man who has any influence in England now ,"" said Vane , and his high voice fell to a sudden and convincing quietude . "" Whom do you mean ?"" asked Turnbull . "" I mean that cursed fellow with the long split chin ,"" said the other . "" Is it really true ,"" asked Turnbull , "" that he has been allowed to buy up and control such a lot ? What put the country into such a state ?"""
chesterton#"Mr . Cumberland Vane laughed outright . "" What put the country into such a state ?"" he asked . "" Why , you did . When you were fool enough to agree to fight MacIan , after all , everybody was ready to believe that the Bank of England might paint itself pink with white spots ."" "" I don ' t understand ,"" answered Turnbull ."
chesterton#""" Why should you be surprised at my fighting ? I hope I have always fought ."" "" Well ,"" said Cumberland Vane , airily , "" you didn ' t believe in religion , you see -- so we thought you were safe at any rate . You went further in your language than most of us wanted to go ; no good in just hurting one ' s mother ' s feelings , I think . But of course we all knew you were right , and , really , we relied on you ."" "" Did you ?"""
chesterton#"said the editor of _The Atheist_ with a bursting heart . "" I am sorry you did not tell me so at the time ."" He walked away very rapidly and flung himself on a garden seat , and for some six minutes his own wrongs hid from him the huge and hilarious fact that Cumberland Vane had been locked up as a lunatic . The garden of the madhouse was so perfectly planned , and answered so exquisitely to every hour of daylight , that one could almost fancy that the sunlight was caught there tangled in its tinted trees , as the wise men of Gotham tried to chain the spring to a bush . Or it seemed as if this ironic paradise still kept its unique dawn or its special sunset while the rest of the earthly globe rolled through its ordinary hours . There was one evening , or late afternoon , in particular , which Evan MacIan will remember in the last moments of death ."
chesterton#It was what artists call a daffodil sky , but it is coarsened even by reference to a daffodil . It was of that innocent lonely yellow which has never heard of orange , though it might turn quite unconsciously into green . Against it the tops , one might say the turrets , of the clipt and ordered trees were outlined in that shade of veiled violet which tints the tops of lavender . A white early moon was hardly traceable upon that delicate yellow . MacIan , I say , will remember this tender and transparent evening , partly because of its virgin gold and silver , and partly because he passed beneath it through the most horrible instant of his life . Turnbull was sitting on his seat on the lawn , and the golden evening impressed even his positive nature , as indeed it might have impressed the oxen in a field .
chesterton#He was shocked out of his idle mood of awe by seeing MacIan break from behind the bushes and run across the lawn with an action he had never seen in the man before , with all his experience of the eccentric humours of this Celt . MacIan fell on the bench , shaking it so that it rattled , and gripped it with his knees like one in dreadful pain of body . That particular run and tumble is typical only of a man who has been hit by some sudden and incurable evil , who is bitten by a viper or condemned to be hanged . Turnbull looked up in the white face of his friend and enemy , and almost turned cold at what he saw there . He had seen the blue but gloomy eyes of the western Highlander troubled by as many tempests as his own west Highland seas , but there had always been a fixed star of faith behind the storms . Now the star had gone out , and there was only misery .
chesterton#"Yet MacIan had the strength to answer the question where Turnbull , taken by surprise , had not the strength to ask it . "" They are right , they are right !"" he cried . "" O my God ! they are right , Turnbull . I ought to be here !"""
chesterton#"He went on with shapeless fluency as if he no longer had the heart to choose or check his speech . "" I suppose I ought to have guessed long ago -- all my big dreams and schemes -- and everyone being against us -- but I was stuck up , you know ."" "" Do tell me about it , really ,"" cried the atheist , and , faced with the furnace of the other ' s pain , he did not notice that he spoke with the affection of a father . "" I am mad , Turnbull ,"" said Evan , with a dead clearness of speech , and leant back against the garden seat . "" Nonsense ,"" said the other , clutching at the obvious cue of benevolent brutality , "" this is one of your silly moods ."" MacIan shook his head ."
chesterton#""" I know enough about myself ,"" he said , "" to allow for any mood , though it opened heaven or hell . But to see things -- to see them walking solid in the sun -- things that can ' t be there -- real mystics never do that , Turnbull ."" "" What things ?"" asked the other , incredulously . MacIan lowered his voice . "" I saw _her_ ,"" he said , "" three minutes ago -- walking here in this hell yard ."""
chesterton#"Between trying to look scornful and really looking startled , Turnbull ' s face was confused enough to emit no speech , and Evan went on in monotonous sincerity : "" I saw her walk behind those blessed trees against that holy sky of gold as plain as I can see her whenever I shut my eyes . I did shut them , and opened them again , and she was still there -- that is , of course , she wasn ' t ---- She still had a little fur round her neck , but her dress was a shade brighter than when I really saw her ."" "" My dear fellow ,"" cried Turnbull , rallying a hearty laugh , "" the fancies have really got hold of you . You mistook some other poor girl here for her ."" "" Mistook some other ----"" said MacIan , and words failed him altogether ."
chesterton#"They sat for some moments in the mellow silence of the evening garden , a silence that was stifling for the sceptic , but utterly empty and final for the man of faith . At last he broke out again with the words : "" Well , anyhow , if I ' m mad , I ' m glad I ' m mad on that ."" Turnbull murmured some clumsy deprecation , and sat stolidly smoking to collect his thoughts ; the next instant he had all his nerves engaged in the mere effort to sit still . Across the clear space of cold silver and a pale lemon sky which was left by the gap in the ilex - trees there passed a slim , dark figure , a profile and the poise of a dark head like a bird ' s , which really pinned him to his seat with the point of coincidence . With an effort he got to his feet , and said with a voice of affected insouciance : "" By George ! MacIan , she is uncommonly like ----"""
chesterton#""" What !"" cried MacIan , with a leap of eagerness that was heart - breaking , "" do you see her , too ?"" And the blaze came back into the centre of his eyes . Turnbull ' s tawny eyebrows were pulled together with a peculiar frown of curiosity , and all at once he walked quickly across the lawn . MacIan sat rigid , but peered after him with open and parched lips . He saw the sight which either proved him sane or proved the whole universe half - witted ; he saw the man of flesh approach that beautiful phantom , saw their gestures of recognition , and saw them against the sunset joining hands ."
chesterton#He could stand it no longer , but ran across to the path , turned the corner and saw standing quite palpable in the evening sunlight , talking with a casual grace to Turnbull , the face and figure which had filled his midnights with frightfully vivid or desperately half - forgotten features . She advanced quite pleasantly and coolly , and put out her hand . The moment that he touched it he knew that he was sane even if the solar system was crazy . She was entirely elegant and unembarrassed . That is the awful thing about women -- they refuse to be emotional at emotional moments , upon some such ludicrous pretext as there being someone else there . But MacIan was in a condition of criticism much less than the average masculine one , being in fact merely overturned by the rushing riddle of the events .
chesterton#"Evan does not know to this day what particular question he asked , but he vividly remembers that she answered , and every line or fluctuation of her face as she said it . "" Oh , don ' t you know ?"" she said , smiling , and suddenly lifting her level brown eyebrows . "" Haven ' t you heard the news ? I ' m a lunatic ."" Then she added after a short pause , and with a sort of pride : "" I ' ve got a certificate ."""
chesterton#"Her manner , by the matchless social stoicism of her sex , was entirely suited to a drawing - room , but Evan ' s reply fell somewhat far short of such a standard , as he only said : "" What the devil in hell does all this nonsense mean ?"" "" Really ,"" said the young lady , and laughed . "" I beg your pardon ,"" said the unhappy young man , rather wildly , "" but what I mean is , why are you here in an asylum ?"" The young woman broke again into one of the maddening and mysterious laughs of femininity . Then she composed her features , and replied with equal dignity : "" Well , if it comes to that , why are you ?"" The fact that Turnbull had strolled away and was investigating rhododendrons may have been due to Evan ' s successful prayers to the other world , or possibly to his own pretty successful experience of this one ."
chesterton#"But though they two were as isolated as a new Adam and Eve in a pretty ornamental Eden , the lady did not relax by an inch the rigour of her badinage . "" I am locked up in the madhouse ,"" said Evan , with a sort of stiff pride , "" because I tried to keep my promise to you ."" "" Quite so ,"" answered the inexplicable lady , nodding with a perfectly blazing smile , "" and I am locked up because it was to me you promised ."" "" It is outrageous !"" cried Evan ; "" it is impossible !"" "" Oh , you can see my certificate if you like ,"" she replied with some hauteur ."
chesterton#"MacIan stared at her and then at his boots , and then at the sky and then at her again . He was quite sure now that he himself was not mad , and the fact rather added to his perplexity . Then he drew nearer to her , and said in a dry and dreadful voice : "" Oh , don ' t condescend to play the fool with such a fool as me . Are you really locked up here as a patient -- because you helped us to escape ?"" "" Yes ,"" she said , still smiling , but her steady voice had a shake in it . Evan flung his big elbow across his forehead and burst into tears ."
chesterton#The pure lemon of the sky faded into purer white as the great sunset silently collapsed . The birds settled back into the trees ; the moon began to glow with its own light . Mr . James Turnbull continued his botanical researches into the structure of the rhododendron . But the lady did not move an inch until Evan had flung up his face again ; and when he did he saw by the last gleam of sunlight that it was not only his face that was wet . Mr . James Turnbull had all his life professed a profound interest in physical science , and the phenomena of a good garden were really a pleasure to him ; but after three - quarters of an hour or so even the apostle of science began to find rhododendrus a bore , and was somewhat relieved when an unexpected development of events obliged him to transfer his researches to the equally interesting subject of hollyhocks , which grew some fifty feet farther along the path . The ostensible cause of his removal was the unexpected reappearance of his two other acquaintances walking and talking laboriously along the way , with the black head bent close to the brown one .
chesterton#"Even hollyhocks detained Turnbull but a short time . Having rapidly absorbed all the important principles affecting the growth of those vegetables , he jumped over a flower - bed and walked back into the building . The other two came up along the slow course of the path talking and talking . No one but God knows what they said ( for they certainly have forgotten ), and if I remembered it I would not repeat it . When they parted at the head of the walk she put out her hand again in the same well - bred way , although it trembled ; he seemed to restrain a gesture as he let it fall . "" If it is really always to be like this ,"" he said , thickly , "" it would not matter if we were here for ever ."""
chesterton#""" You tried to kill yourself four times for me ,"" she said , unsteadily , "" and I have been chained up as a madwoman for you . I really think that after that ----"" "" Yes , I know ,"" said Evan in a low voice , looking down . "" After that we belong to each other . We are sort of sold to each other -- until the stars fall ."" Then he looked up suddenly , and said : "" By the way , what is your name ?"""
chesterton#""" My name is Beatrice Drake ,"" she replied with complete gravity . "" You can see it on my certificate of lunacy ."" XIX . THE LAST PARLEY Turnbull walked away , wildly trying to explain to himself the presence of two personal acquaintances so different as Vane and the girl . As he skirted a low hedge of laurel , an enormously tall young man leapt over it , stood in front of him , and almost fell on his neck as if seeking to embrace him ."
chesterton#""" Don ' t you know me ?"" almost sobbed the young man , who was in the highest spirits . "" Ain ' t I written on your heart , old boy ? I say , what did you do with my yacht ?"" "" Take your arms off my neck ,"" said Turnbull , irritably . "" Are you mad ?"""
chesterton#"The young man sat down on the gravel path and went into ecstasies of laughter . "" No , that ' s just the fun of it -- I ' m not mad ,"" he replied . "" They ' ve shut me up in this place , and I ' m not mad ."" And he went off again into mirth as innocent as wedding - bells . Turnbull , whose powers of surprise were exhausted , rolled his round grey eyes and said , "" Mr . Wilkinson , I think ,"" because he could not think of anything else to say . The tall man sitting on the gravel bowed with urbanity , and said : "" Quite at your service ."
chesterton#"Not to be confused with the Wilkinsons of Cumberland ; and as I say , old boy , what have you done with my yacht ? You see , they ' ve locked me up here -- in this garden -- and a yacht would be a sort of occupation for an unmarried man ."" "" I am really horribly sorry ,"" began Turnbull , in the last stage of bated bewilderment and exasperation , "" but really ----"" "" Oh , I can see you can ' t have it on you at the moment ,"" said Mr . Wilkinson with much intellectual magnanimity . "" Well , the fact is ----"" began Turnbull again , and then the phrase was frozen on his mouth , for round the corner came the goatlike face and gleaming eye - glasses of Dr . Quayle . "" Ah , my dear Mr . Wilkinson ,"" said the doctor , as if delighted at a coincidence ; "" and Mr . Turnbull , too ."
chesterton#"Why , I want to speak to Mr . Turnbull ."" Mr . Turnbull made some movement rather of surrender than assent , and the doctor caught it up exquisitely , showing even more of his two front teeth . "" I am sure Mr . Wilkinson will excuse us a moment ."" And with flying frock - coat he led Turnbull rapidly round the corner of a path . "" My dear sir ,"" he said , in a quite affectionate manner , "" I do not mind telling you -- you are such a very hopeful case -- you understand so well the scientific point of view ; and I don ' t like to see you bothered by the really hopeless cases ."
chesterton#"They are monotonous and maddening . The man you have just been talking to , poor fellow , is one of the strongest cases of pure _idee fixe_ that we have . It ' s very sad , and I ' m afraid utterly incurable . He keeps on telling everybody ""-- and the doctor lowered his voice confidentially --"" he tells everybody that two people have taken is yacht . His account of how he lost it is quite incoherent ."" Turnbull stamped his foot on the gravel path , and called out : "" Oh , I can ' t stand this ."
chesterton#"Really ----"" "" I know , I know ,"" said the psychologist , mournfully ; "" it is a most melancholy case , and also fortunately a very rare one . It is so rare , in fact , that in one classification of these maladies it is entered under a heading by itself -- Perdinavititis , mental inflammation creating the impression that one has lost a ship . Really ,"" he added , with a kind of half - embarrassed guilt , "" it ' s rather a feather in my cap . I discovered the only existing case of perdinavititis ."" "" But this won ' t do , doctor ,"" said Turnbull , almost tearing his hair , "" this really won ' t do ."
chesterton#"The man really did lose a ship . Indeed , not to put too fine a point on it , I took his ship ."" Dr . Quayle swung round for an instant so that his silk - lined overcoat rustled , and stared singularly at Turnbull . Then he said with hurried amiability : "" Why , of course you did . Quite so , quite so ,"" and with courteous gestures went striding up the garden path . Under the first laburnum - tree he stopped , however , and pulling out his pencil and notebook wrote down feverishly : "" Singular development in the Elenthero - maniac , Turnbull ."
chesterton#"Sudden manifestation of Rapinavititis -- the delusion that one has stolen a ship . First case ever recorded ."" Turnbull stood for an instant staggered into stillness . Then he ran raging round the garden to find MacIan , just as a husband , even a bad husband , will run raging to find his wife if he is full of a furious query . He found MacIan stalking moodily about the half - lit garden , after his extraordinary meeting with Beatrice . No one who saw his slouching stride and sunken head could have known that his soul was in the seventh heaven of ecstasy ."
chesterton#He did not think ; he did not even very definitely desire . He merely wallowed in memories , chiefly in material memories ; words said with a certain cadence or trivial turns of the neck or wrist . Into the middle of his stationary and senseless enjoyment were thrust abruptly the projecting elbow and the projecting red beard of Turnbull . MacIan stepped back a little , and the soul in his eyes came very slowly to its windows . When James Turnbull had the glittering sword - point planted upon his breast he was in far less danger . For three pulsating seconds after the interruption MacIan was in a mood to have murdered his father .
chesterton#"And yet his whole emotional anger fell from him when he saw Turnbull ' s face , in which the eyes seemed to be bursting from the head like bullets . All the fire and fragrance even of young and honourable love faded for a moment before that stiff agony of interrogation . "" Are you hurt , Turnbull ?"" he asked , anxiously . "" I am dying ,"" answered the other quite calmly . "" I am in the quite literal sense of the words dying to know something ."
chesterton#"I want to know what all this can possibly mean ."" MacIan did not answer , and he continued with asperity : "" You are still thinking about that girl , but I tell you the whole thing is incredible . She ' s not the only person here . I ' ve met the fellow Wilkinson , whose yacht we lost . I ' ve met the very magistrate you were hauled up to when you broke my window . What can it mean -- meeting all these old people again ?"
chesterton#"One never meets such old friends again except in a dream ."" Then after a silence he cried with a rending sincerity : "" Are you really there , Evan ? Have you ever been really there ? Am I simply dreaming ?"" MacIan had been listening with a living silence to every word , and now his face flamed with one of his rare revelations of life . "" No , you good atheist ,"" he cried ; "" no , you clean , courteous , reverent , pious old blasphemer ."
chesterton#"No , you are not dreaming -- you are waking up ."" "" What do you mean ?"" "" There are two states where one meets so many old friends ,"" said MacIan ; "" one is a dream , the other is the end of the world ."" "" And you say ----"" "" I say this is not a dream ,"" said Evan in a ringing voice . "" You really mean to suggest ----"" began Turnbull ."
chesterton#""" Be silent ! or I shall say it all wrong ,"" said MacIan , breathing hard . "" It ' s hard to explain , anyhow . An apocalypse is the opposite of a dream . A dream is falser than the outer life . But the end of the world is more actual than the world it ends ."
chesterton#"I don ' t say this is really the end of the world , but it ' s something like that -- it ' s the end of something . All the people are crowding into one corner . Everything is coming to a point ."" "" What is the point ?"" asked Turnbull . "" I can ' t see it ,"" said Evan ; "" it is too large and plain ."""
chesterton#"Then after a silence he said : "" I can ' t see it -- and yet I will try to describe it . Turnbull , three days ago I saw quite suddenly that our duel was not right after all ."" "" Three days ago !"" repeated Turnbull . "" When and why did this illumination occur ?"" "" I knew I was not quite right ,"" answered Evan , "" the moment I saw the round eyes of that old man in the cell ."""
chesterton#""" Old man in the cell !"" repeated his wondering companion . "" Do you mean the poor old idiot who likes spikes to stick out ?"" "" Yes ,"" said MacIan , after a slight pause , "" I mean the poor old idiot who likes spikes to stick out . When I saw his eyes and heard his old croaking accent , I knew that it would not really have been right to kill you . It would have been a venial sin ."""
chesterton#""" I am much obliged ,"" said Turnbull , gruffly . "" You must give me time ,"" said MacIan , quite patiently , "" for I am trying to tell the whole truth . I am trying to tell more of it than I know ."" "" So you see I confess ""-- he went on with laborious distinctness -- "" I confess that all the people who called our duel mad were right in a way . I would confess it to old Cumberland Vane and his eye - glass . I would confess it even to that old ass in brown flannel who talked to us about Love ."
chesterton#"Yes , they are right in a way . I am a little mad ."" He stopped and wiped his brow as if he were literally doing heavy labour . Then he went on : "" I am a little mad ; but , after all , it is only a little madness . When hundreds of high - minded men had fought duesl about a jostle with the elbow or the ace of spades , the whole world need not have gone wild over my one little wildness ."
chesterton#"Plenty of other people have killed themselves between then and now . But all England has gone into captivity in order to take us captive . All England has turned into a lunatic asylum in order to prove us lunatics . Compared with the general public , I might positively be called sane ."" He stopped again , and went on with the same air of travailing with the truth : "" When I saw that , I saw everything ; I saw the Church and the world ."
chesterton#The Church in its earthly action has really touched morbid things -- tortures and bleeding visions and blasts of extermination . The Church has had her madnesses , and I am one of them . I am the massacre of St . Bartholomew . I am the Inquisition of Spain . I do not say that we have never gone mad , but I say that we are fit to act as keepers to our enemies . Massacre is wicked even with a provocation , as in the Bartholomew .
chesterton#But your modern Nietzsche will tell you that massacre would be glorious without a provocation . Torture should be violently stopped , though the Church is doing it . But your modern Tolstoy will tell you that it ought not to be violently stopped whoever is doing it . In the long run , which is most mad -- the Church or the world ? Which is madder , the Spanish priest who permitted tyranny , or the Prussian sophist who admired it ? Which is madder , the Russian priest who discourages righteous rebellion , or the Russian novelist who forbids it ?
chesterton#That is the final and blasting test . The world left to itself grows wilder than any creed . A few days ago you and I were the maddest people in England . Now , by God ! I believe we are the sanest . That is the only real question -- whether the Church is really madder than the world .
chesterton#"Let the rationalists run their own race , and let us see where _they_ end . If the world has some healthy balance other than God , let the world find it . Does the world find it ? Cut the world loose ,"" he cried with a savage gesture . "" Does the world stand on its own end ? Does it stand , or does it stagger ?"""
chesterton#"Turnbull remained silent , and MacIan said to him , looking once more at the earth : "" It staggers , Turnbull . It cannot stand by itself ; you know it cannot . It has been the sorrow of your life . Turnbull , this garden is not a dream , but an apocalyptic fulfilment . This garden is the world gone mad ."" Turnbull did not move his head , and he had been listening all the time ; yet , somehow , the other knew that for the first time he was listening seriously ."
chesterton#""" The world has gone mad ,"" said MacIan , "" and it has gone mad about Us . The world takes the trouble to make a big mistake about every little mistake made by the Church . That is why they have turned ten counties to a madhouse ; that is why crowds of kindly people are poured into this filthy melting - pot . Now is the judgement of this world . The Prince of this World is judged , and he is judged exactly because he is judging . There is at last one simple solution to the quarrel between the ball and the cross ----"""
chesterton#"Turnbull for the first time started . "" The ball and ----"" he repeated . "" What is the matter with you ?"" asked MacIan . "" I had a dream ,"" said Turnbull , thickly and obscurely , "" in which I saw the cross struck crooked and the ball secure ----"" "" I had a dream ,"" said MacIan , "" in which I saw the cross erect and the ball invisible ."
chesterton#They were both dreams from hell . There must be some round earth to plant the cross upon . But here is the awful difference -- that the round world will not consent even to continue round . The astronomers are always telling us that it is shaped like an orange , or like an egg , or like a German sausage . They beat the old world about like a bladder and thump it into a thousand shapeless shapes . Turnbull , we cannot trust the ball to be always a ball ; we cannot trust reason to be reasonable .
chesterton#"In the end the great terrestrial globe will go quite lop - sided , and only the cross will stand upright ."" There was a long silence , and then Turnbull said , hesitatingly : "" Has it occurred to you that since -- since those two dreams , or whatever they were ----"" "" Well ?"" murmured MacIan . "" Since then ,"" went on Turnbull , in the same low voice , "" since then we have never even looked for our swords ."" "" You are right ,"" answered Evan almost inaudibly ."
chesterton#""" We have found something which we both hate more than we ever hated each other , and I think I know its name ."" Turnbull seemed to frown and flinch for a moment . "" It does not much matter what you call it ,"" he said , "" so long as you keep out of its way ."" The bushes broke and snapped abruptly behind them , and a very tall figure towered above Turnbull with an arrogant stoop and a projecting chin , a chin of which the shape showed queerly even in its shadow upon the path . "" You see that is not so easy ,"" said MacIan between his teeth . They looked up into the eyes of the Master , but looked only for a moment ."
chesterton#"The eyes were full of a frozen and icy wrath , a kind of utterly heartless hatred . His voice was for the first time devoid of irony . There was no more sarcasm in it than there is in an iron club . "" You will be inside the building in three minutes ,"" he said , with pulverizing precision , "" or you will be fired on by the artillery at all the windows . There is too much talking in this garden ; we intend to close it . You will be accommodated indoors ."""
chesterton#""" Ah !"" said MacIan , with a long and satisfied sigh , "" then I was right ."" And he turned his back and walked obediently towards the building . Turnbull seemed to canvass for a few minutes the notion of knocking the Master down , and then fell under the same almost fairy fatalism as his companion . In some strange way it did seem that the more smoothly they yielded , the more swiftly would events sweep on to some great collision . XX ."
chesterton#DIES IRAE As they advanced towards the asylum they looked up at its rows on rows of windows , and understood the Master ' s material threat . By means of that complex but concealed machinery which ran like a network of nerves over the whole fabric , there had been shot out under every window - ledge rows and rows of polished - steel cylinders , the cold miracles of modern gunnery . They commanded the whole garden and the whole country - side , and could have blown to pieces an army corps . This silent declaration of war had evidently had its complete effect . As MacIan and Turnbull walked steadily but slowly towards the entrance hall of the institution , they could see that most , or at least many , of the patients had already gathered there as well as the staff of doctors and the whole regiment of keepers and assistants .
chesterton#But when they entered the lamp - lit hall , and the high iron door was clashed to and locked behind them , yet a new amazement leapt into their eyes , and the stalwart Turnbull almost fell . For he saw a sight which was indeed , as MacIan had said -- either the Day of Judgement or a dream . Within a few feet of him at one corner of the square of standing people stood the girl he had known in Jersey , Madeleine Durand . She looked straight at him with a steady smile which lit up the scene of darkness and unreason like the light of some honest fireside . Her square face and throat were thrown back , as her habit was , and there was something almost sleepy in the geniality of her eyes . He saw her first , and for a few seconds saw her only ; then the outer edge of his eyesight took in all the other staring faces , and he saw all the faces he had ever seen for weeks and months past .
chesterton#There was the Tolstoyan in Jaeger flannel , with the yellow beard that went backward and the foolish nose and eyes that went forward , with the curiosity of a crank . He was talking eagerly to Mr . Gordon , the corpulent Jew shopkeeper whom they had once gagged in his own shop . There was the tipsy old Hertfordshire rustic ; he was talking energetically to himself . There was not only Mr . Vane the magistrate , but the clerk of Mr . Vane , the magistrate . There was not only Miss Drake of the motor - car , but also Miss Drake ' s chauffeur . Nothing wild or unfamiliar could have produced upon Turnbull such a nightmare impression as that ring of familiar faces .
chesterton#"Yet he had one intellectual shock which was greater than all the others . He stepped impulsively forward towards Madeleine , and then wavered with a kind of wild humility . As he did so he caught sight of another square face behind Madeleine ' s , a face with long grey whiskers and an austere stare . It was old Durand , the girls ' father ; and when Turnbull saw him he saw the last and worst marvel of that monstrous night . He remembered Durand ; he remembered his monotonous , everlasting lucidity , his stupefyingly sensible views of everything , his colossal contentment with truisms merely because they were true . "" Confound it all !"""
chesterton#"cried Turnbull to himself , "" if _he_ is in the asylum , there can ' t be anyone outside ."" He drew nearer to Madeleine , but still doubtfully and all the more so because she still smiled at him . MacIan had already gone across to Beatrice with an air of fright . Then all these bewildered but partly amicable recognitions were cloven by a cruel voice which always made all human blood turn bitter . The Master was standing in the middle of the room surveying the scene like a great artist looking at a completed picture . Handsome as he looked , they had never seen so clearly what was really hateful in his face ; and even then they could only express it by saying that the arched brows and the long emphatic chin gave it always a look of being lit from below , like the face of some infernal actor ."
chesterton#""" This is indeed a cosy party ,"" he said , with glittering eyes . The Master evidently meant to say more , but before he could say anything M . Durand had stepped right up to him and was speaking . He was speaking exactly as a French bourgeois speaks to the manager of a restaurant . That is , he spoke with rattling and breathless rapidity , but with no incoherence , and therefore with no emotion . It was a steady , monotonous vivacity , which came not seemingly from passion , but merely from the reason having been sent off at a gallop . He was saying something like this :"
chesterton#""" You refuse me my half - bottle of Medoc , the drink the most wholesome and the most customary . You refuse me the company and obedience of my daughter , which Nature herself indicates . You refuse me the beef and mutton , without pretence that it is a fast of the Church . You now forbid me the promenade , a thing necessary to a person of my age . It is useless to tell me that you do all this by law . Law rests upon the social contract ."
chesterton#"If the citizen finds himself despoiled of such pleasures and powers as he would have had even in the savage state , the social contract is annulled ."" "" It ' s no good chattering away , Monsieur ,"" said Hutton , for the Master was silent . "" The place is covered with machine - guns . We ' ve got to obey our orders , and so have you ."" "" The machinery is of the most perfect ,"" assented Durand , somewhat irrelevantly ; "" worked by petroleum , I believe . I only ask you to admit that if such things fall below the comfort of barbarism , the social contract is annulled ."
chesterton#"It is a pretty little point of theory ."" "" Oh ! I dare say ,"" said Hutton . Durand bowed quite civilly and withdrew . "" A cosy party ,"" resumed the Master , scornfully , "" and yet I believe some of you are in doubt about how we all came together . I will explain it , ladies and gentlemen ; I will explain everything ."
chesterton#"To whom shall I specially address myself ? To Mr . James Turnbull . He has a scientific mind ."" Turnbull seemed to choke with sudden protest . The Master seemed only to cough out of pure politeness and proceeded : "" Mr . Turnbull will agree with me ,"" he said , "" when I say that we long felt in scientific circles that great harm was done by such a legend as that of the Crucifixion ."" Turnbull growled something which was presumably assent ."
chesterton#"The Master went on smoothly : "" It was in vain for us to urge that the incident was irrelevant ; that there were many such fanatics , many such executions . We were forced to take the thing thoroughly in hand , to investigate it in the spirit of scientific history , and with the assistance of Mr . Turnbull and others we were happy in being able to announce that this alleged Crucifixion never occurred at all ."" MacIan lifted his head and looked at the Master steadily , but Turnbull did not look up . "" This , we found , was the only way with all superstitions ,"" continued the speaker ; "" it was necessary to deny them historically , and we have done it with great success in the case of miracles and such things . Now within our own time there arose an unfortunate fuss which threatened ( as Mr . Turnbull would say ) to galvanize the corpse of Christianity into a fictitious life -- the alleged case of a Highland eccentric who wanted to fight for the Virgin ."" MacIan , quite white , made a step forward , but the speaker did not alter his easy attitude or his flow of words ."
chesterton#""" Again we urged that this duel was not to be admired , that it was a mere brawl , but the people were ignorant and romantic . There were signs of treating this alleged Highlander and his alleged opponent as heroes . We tried all other means of arresting this reactionary hero worship . Working men who betted on the duel were imprisoned for gambling . Working men who drank the health of a duellist were imprisoned for drunkenness . But the popular excitement about the alleged duel continued , and we had to fall back on our old historical method ."
chesterton#"We investigated , on scientific principles , the story of MacIan ' s challenge , and we are happy to be able to inform you that the whole story of the attempted duel is a fable . There never was any challenge . There never was any man named MacIan . It is a melodramatic myth , like Calvary ."" Not a soul moved save Turnbull , who lifted his head ; yet there was the sense of a silent explosion . "" The whole story of the MacIan challenge ,"" went on the Master , beaming at them all with a sinister benignity , "" has been found to originate in the obsessions of a few pathological types , who are now all fortunately in our care ."
chesterton#"There is , for instance , a person here of the name of Gordon , formerly the keeper of a curiosity shop . He is a victim of the disease called Vinculomania -- the impression that one has been bound or tied up . We have also a case of Fugacity ( Mr . Whimpey ), who imagines that he was chased by two men ."" The indignant faces of the Jew shopkeeper and the Magdalen Don started out of the crowd in their indignation , but the speaker continued : "" One poor woman we have with us ,"" he said , in a compassionate voice , "" believes she was in a motor - car with two such men ; this is the well - known illusion of speed on which I need not dwell . Another wretched woman has the simple egotistic mania that she has caused the duel ."
chesterton#"Madeleine Durand actually professes to have been the subject of the fight between MacIan and his enemy , a fight which , if it occurred at all , certainly began long before . But it never occurred at all . We have taken in hand every person who professed to have seen such a thing , and proved them all to be unbalanced . That is why they are here ."" The Master looked round the room , just showing his perfect teeth with the perfection of artistic cruelty , exalted for a moment in the enormous simplicity of his success , and then walked across the hall and vanished through an inner door . His two lieutenants , Quayle and Hutton , were left standing at the head of the great army of servants and keepers ."
chesterton#""" I hope we shall have no more trouble ,"" said Dr . Quayle pleasantly enough , and addressing Turnbull , who was leaning heavily upon the back of a chair . Still looking down , Turnbull lifted the chair an inch or two from the ground . Then he suddenly swung it above his head and sent it at the inquiring doctor with an awful crash which sent one of its wooden legs loose along the floor and crammed the doctor gasping into a corner . MacIan gave a great shout , snatched up the loose chair - leg , and , rushing on the other doctor , felled him with a blow . Twenty attendants rushed to capture the rebels ; MacIan flung back three of them and Turnbull went over on top of one , when from behind them all came a shriek as of something quite fresh and frightful . Two of the three passages leading out of the hall were choked with blue smoke ."
chesterton#"Another instant and the hall was full of the fog of it , and red sparks began to swarm like scarlet bees . "" The place is on fire !"" cried Quayle with a scream of indecent terror . "" Oh , who can have done it ? How can it have happened ?"" A light had come into Turnbull ' s eyes ."
chesterton#""" How did the French Revolution happen ?"" he asked . "" Oh , how should I know !"" wailed the other . "" Then I will tell you ,"" said Turnbull ; "" it happened because some people fancied that a French grocer was as respectable as he looked ."" Even as he spoke , as if by confirmation , old Mr . Durand re - entered the smoky room quite placidly , wiping the petroleum from his hands with a handkerchief ."
chesterton#"He had set fire to the building in accordance with the strict principles of the social contract . But MacIan had taken a stride forward and stood there shaken and terrible . "" Now ,"" he cried , panting , "" now is the judgement of the world . The doctors will leave this place ; the keepers will leave this place . They will leave us in charge of the machinery and the machine - guns at the windows . But we , the lunatics , will wait to be burned alive if only we may see them go ."""
chesterton#""" How do you know we shall go ?"" asked Hutton , fiercely . "" You believe nothing ,"" said MacIan , simply , "" and you are insupportably afraid of death ."" "" So this is suicide ,"" sneered the doctor ; "" a somewhat doubtful sign of sanity ."" "" Not at all -- this is vengeance ,"" answered Turnbull , quite calmly ; "" a thing which is completely healthy ."" "" You think the doctors will go ,"" said Hutton , savagely ."
chesterton#""" The keepers have gone already ,"" said Turnbull . Even as they spoke the main doors were burst open in mere brutal panic , and all the officers and subordinates of the asylum rushed away across the garden pursued by the smoke . But among the ticketed maniacs not a man or woman moved . "" We hate dying ,"" said Turnbull , with composure , "" but we hate you even more . This is a successful revolution ."" In the roof above their heads a panel shot back , showing a strip of star - lit sky and a huge thing made of white metal , with the shape and fins of a fish , swinging as if at anchor ."
chesterton#"At the same moment a steel ladder slid down from the opening and struck the floor , and the cleft chin of the mysterious Master was thrust into the opening . "" Quayle , Hutton ,"" he said , "" you will escape with me ."" And they went up the ladder like automata of lead . Long after they had clambered into the car , the creature with the cloven face continued to leer down upon the smoke - stung crowd below . Then at last he said in a silken voice and with a smile of final satisfaction : "" By the way , I fear I am very absent minded ."
chesterton#"There is one man specially whom , somehow , I always forget . I always leave him lying about . Once I mislaid him on the Cross of St . Paul ' s . So silly of me ; and now I ' ve forgotten him in one of those little cells where your fire is burning . Very unfortunate -- especially for him ."" And nodding genially , he climbed into his flying ship ."
chesterton#MacIan stood motionless for two minutes , and then rushed down one of the suffocating corridors till he found the flames . Turnbull looked once at Madeleine , and followed . * * * MacIan , with singed hair , smoking garments , and smarting hands and face , had already broken far enough through the first barriers of burning timber to come within cry of the cells he had once known . It was impossible , however , to see the spot where the old man lay dead or alive ; not now through darkness , but through scorching and aching light . The site of the old half - wit ' s cell was now the heart of a standing forest of fire -- the flames as thick and yellow as a cornfield .
chesterton#"Their incessant shrieking and crackling was like a mob shouting against an orator . Yet through all that deafening density MacIan thought he heard a small and separate sound . When he heard it he rushed forward as if to plunge into that furnace , but Turnbull arrested him by an elbow . "" Let me go !"" cried Evan , in agony ; "" it ' s the poor old beggar ' s voice -- he ' s still alive , and shouting for help ."" "" Listen !"""
chesterton#"said Turnbull , and lifted one finger from his clenched hand . "" Or else he is shrieking with pain ,"" protested MacIan . "" I will not endure it ."" "" Listen !"" repeated Turnbull , grimly . "" Did you ever hear anyone shout for help or shriek with pain in that voice ?"""
chesterton#"The small shrill sounds which came through the crash of the conflagration were indeed of an odd sort , and MacIan turned a face of puzzled inquiry to his companion . "" He is singing ,"" said Turnbull , simply . A remaining rampart fell , crushing the fire , and through the diminished din of it the voice of the little old lunatic came clearer . In the heart of that white - hot hell he was singing like a bird . What he was singing it was not very easy to follow , but it seemed to be something about playing in the golden hay . "" Good Lord !"""
chesterton#"cried Turnbull , bitterly , "" there seem to be some advantages in really being an idiot ."" Then advancing to the fringe of the fire he called out on chance to the invisible singer : "" Can you come out ? Are you cut off ?"" "" God help us all !"" said MacIan , with a shudder ; "" he ' s laughing now ."" At whatever stage of being burned alive the invisible now found himself , he was now shaking out peals of silvery and hilarious laughter ."
chesterton#"As he listened , MacIan ' s two eyes began to glow , as if a strange thought had come into his head . "" Fool , come out and save yourself !"" shouted Turnbull . "" No , by Heaven ! that is not the way ,"" cried Evan , suddenly . "" Father ,"" he shouted , "" come out and save us all !"""
chesterton#The fire , though it had dropped in one or two places , was , upon the whole , higher and more unconquerable than ever . Separate tall flames shot up and spread out above them like the fiery cloisters of some infernal cathedral , or like a grove of red tropical trees in the garden of the devil . Higher yet in the purple hollow of the night the topmost flames leapt again and again fruitlessly at the stars , like golden dragons chained but struggling . The towers and domes of the oppressive smoke seemed high and far enough to drown distant planets in a London fog . But if we exhausted all frantic similes for that frantic scene , the main impression about the fire would still be its ranked upstanding rigidity and a sort of roaring stillness . It was literally a wall of fire .
chesterton#""" Father ,"" cried MacIan , once more , "" come out of it and save us all !"" Turnbull was staring at him as he cried . The tall and steady forest of fire must have been already a portent visible to the whole circle of land and sea . The red flush of it lit up the long sides of white ships far out in the German Ocean , and picked out like piercing rubies the windows in the villages on the distant heights . If any villagers or sailors were looking towards it they must have seen a strange sight as MacIan cried out for the third time . That forest of fire wavered , and was cloven in the centre ; and then the whole of one half of it leaned one way as a cornfield leans all one way under the load of the wind ."
chesterton#Indeed , it looked as if a great wind had sprung up and driven the great fire aslant . Its smoke was no longer sent up to choke the stars , but was trailed and dragged across county after county like one dreadful banner of defeat . But it was not the wind ; or , if it was the wind , it was two winds blowing in opposite directions . For while one half of the huge fire sloped one way towards the inland heights , the other half , at exactly the same angle , sloped out eastward towards the sea . So that earth and ocean could behold , where there had been a mere fiery mass , a thing divided like a V -- a cloven tongue of flame . But if it were a prodigy for those distant , it was something beyond speech for those quite near .
chesterton#As the echoes of Evan ' s last appeal rang and died in the universal uproar , the fiery vault over his head opened down the middle , and , reeling back in two great golden billows , hung on each side as huge and harmless as two sloping hills lie on each side of a valley . Down the centre of this trough , or chasm , a little path ran , cleared of all but ashes , and down this little path was walking a little old man singing as if he were alone in a wood in spring . When James Turnbull saw this he suddenly put out a hand and seemed to support himself on the strong shoulder of Madeleine Durand . Then after a moment ' s hesitation he put his other hand on the shoulder of MacIan . His blue eyes looked extraordinarily brilliant and beautiful . In many sceptical papers and magazines afterwards he was sadly or sternly rebuked for having abandoned the certainties of materialism .
chesterton#All his life up to that moment he had been most honestly certain that materialism was a fact . But he was unlike the writers in the magazines precisely in this -- that he preferred a fact even to materialism . As the little singing figure came nearer and nearer , Evan fell on his knees , and after an instant Beatrice followed ; then Madeleine fell on her knees , and after a longer instant Turnbull followed . Then the little old man went past them singing down that corridor of flames . They had not looked at his face . When he had passed they looked up .
chesterton#While the first light of the fire had shot east and west , painting the sides of ships with fire - light or striking red sparks out of windowed houses , it had not hitherto struck upward , for there was above it the ponderous and rococo cavern of its own monstrous coloured smoke . But now the fire was turned to left and right like a woman ' s hair parted in the middle , and now the shafts of its light could shoot up into empty heavens and strike anything , either bird or cloud . But it struck something that was neither cloud nor bird . Far , far away up in those huge hollows of space something was flying swiftly and shining brightly , something that shone too bright and flew too fast to be any of the fowls of the air , though the red light lit it from underneath like the breast of a bird . Everyone knew it was a flying ship , and everyone knew whose . As they stared upward the little speck of light seemed slightly tilted , and two black dots dropped from the edge of it .
chesterton#"All the eager , upturned faces watched the two dots as they grew bigger and bigger in their downward rush . Then someone screamed , and no one looked up any more . For the two bodies , larger every second flying , spread out and sprawling in the fire - light , were the dead bodies of the two doctors whom Professor Lucifer had carried with him -- the weak and sneering Quayle , the cold and clumsy Hutton . They went with a crash into the thick of the fire . "" They are gone !"" screamed Beatrice , hiding her head ."
chesterton#""" O God ! The are lost !"" Evan put his arm about her , and remembered his own vision . "" No , they are not lost ,"" he said . "" They are saved . He has taken away no souls with him , after all ."""
chesterton#He looked vaguely about at the fire that was already fading , and there among the ashes lay two shining things that had survived the fire , his sword and Turnbull ' s , fallen haphazard in the pattern of a cross .

chesterton#""" I will be with you to explain in a minute or two ."" "" Who you to --"" shouted Nigger Ned , beginning to storm . "" My name is Pooley ,"" replied the other , with a creditable coolness . "" I am the organizing secretary , and I advise you just now to leave the room ."" "" Who this fellow ?"" demanded the dark champion , pointing to the priest disdainfully ."
chesterton#""" My name is Brown ,"" was the reply . "" And I advise you just now to leave the country ."" The prize - fighter stood glaring for a few seconds , and then , rather to the surprise of Flambeau and the others , strode out , sending the door to with a crash behind him . "" Well ,"" asked Father Brown rubbing his dusty hair up , "" what do you think of Leonardo da Vinci ? A beautiful Italian head ."" "" Look here ,"" said Lord Pooley , "" I ' ve taken a considerable responsibility , on your bare word ."
chesterton#"I think you ought to tell me more about this ."" "" You are quite right , my lord ,"" answered Brown . "" And it won ' t take long to tell ."" He put the little leather book in his overcoat pocket . "" I think we know all that this can tell us , but you shall look at it to see if I ' m right . That negro who has just swaggered out is one of the most dangerous men on earth , for he has the brains of a European , with the instincts of a cannibal ."
chesterton#"He has turned what was clean , common - sense butchery among his fellow - barbarians into a very modern and scientific secret society of assassins . He doesn ' t know I know it , nor , for the matter of that , that I can ' t prove it ."" There was a silence , and the little man went on . "" But if I want to murder somebody , will it really be the best plan to make sure I ' m alone with him ?"" Lord Pooley ' s eyes recovered their frosty twinkle as he looked at the little clergyman . He only said : "" If you want to murder somebody , I should advise it ."""
chesterton#"Father Brown shook his head , like a murderer of much riper experience . "" So Flambeau said ,"" he replied , with a sigh . "" But consider . The more a man feels lonely the less he can be sure he is alone . It must mean empty spaces round him , and they are just what make him obvious . Have you never seen one ploughman from the heights , or one shepherd from the valleys ?"
chesterton#"Have you never walked along a cliff , and seen one man walking along the sands ? Didn ' t you know when he ' s killed a crab , and wouldn ' t you have known if it had been a creditor ? No ! No ! No ! For an intelligent murderer , such as you or I might be , it is an impossible plan to make sure that nobody is looking at you ."""
chesterton#""" But what other plan is there ?"" "" There is only one ,"" said the priest . "" To make sure that everybody is looking at something else . A man is throttled close by the big stand at Epsom . Anybody might have seen it done while the stand stood empty -- any tramp under the hedges or motorist among the hills . But nobody would have seen it when the stand was crowded and the whole ring roaring , when the favourite was coming in first -- or wasn ' t ."
chesterton#"The twisting of a neck - cloth , the thrusting of a body behind a door could be done in an instant -- so long as it was that instant . It was the same , of course ,"" he continued turning to Flambeau , "" with that poor fellow under the bandstand . He was dropped through the hole ( it wasn ' t an accidental hole ) just at some very dramatic moment of the entertainment , when the bow of some great violinist or the voice of some great singer opened or came to its climax . And here , of course , when the knock - out blow came -- it would not be the only one . That is the little trick Nigger Ned has adopted from his old God of Gongs ."" "" By the way , Malvoli --"" Pooley began ."
chesterton#""" Malvoli ,"" said the priest , "" has nothing to do with it . I dare say he has some Italians with him , but our amiable friends are not Italians . They are octoroons and African half - bloods of various shades , but I fear we English think all foreigners are much the same so long as they are dark and dirty . Also ,"" he added , with a smile , "" I fear the English decline to draw any fine distinction between the moral character produced by my religion and that which blooms out of Voodoo ."" The blaze of the spring season had burst upon Seawood , littering its foreshore with famines and bathing - machines , with nomadic preachers and nigger minstrels , before the two friends saw it again , and long before the storm of pursuit after the strange secret society had died away . Almost on every hand the secret of their purpose perished with them ."
chesterton#The man of the hotel was found drifting dead on the sea like so much seaweed ; his right eye was closed in peace , but his left eye was wide open , and glistened like glass in the moon . Nigger Ned had been overtaken a mile or two away , and murdered three policemen with his closed left hand . The remaining officer was surprised -- nay , pained -- and the negro got away . But this was enough to set all the English papers in a flame , and for a month or two the main purpose of the British Empire was to prevent the buck nigger ( who was so in both senses ) escaping by any English port . Persons of a figure remotely reconcilable with his were subjected to quite extraordinary inquisitions , made to scrub their faces before going on board ship , as if each white complexion were made up like a mask , of greasepaint . Every negro in England was put under special regulations and made to report himself ; the outgoing ships would no more have taken a nigger than a basilisk .
chesterton#"For people had found out how fearful and vast and silent was the force of the savage secret society , and by the time Flambeau and Father Brown were leaning on the parade parapet in April , the Black Man meant in England almost what he once meant in Scotland . "" He must be still in England ,"" observed Flambeau , "" and horridly well hidden , too . They must have found him at the ports if he had only whitened his face ."" "" You see , he is really a clever man ,"" said Father Brown apologetically . "" And I ' m sure he wouldn ' t whiten his face ."" "" Well , but what would he do ?"""
chesterton#""" I think ,"" said Father Brown , "" he would blacken his face ."" Flambeau , leaning motionless on the parapet , laughed and said : "" My dear fellow !"" Father Brown , also leaning motionless on the parapet , moved one finger for an instant into the direction of the soot - masked niggers singing on the sands . X . The Salad of Colonel Cray FATHER BROWN was walking home from Mass on a white weird morning when the mists were slowly lifting -- one of those mornings when the very element of light appears as something mysterious and new ."
chesterton#The scattered trees outlined themselves more and more out of the vapour , as if they were first drawn in grey chalk and then in charcoal . At yet more distant intervals appeared the houses upon the broken fringe of the suburb ; their outlines became clearer and clearer until he recognized many in which he had chance acquaintances , and many more the names of whose owners he knew . But all the windows and doors were sealed ; none of the people were of the sort that would be up at such a time , or still less on such an errand . But as he passed under the shadow of one handsome villa with verandas and wide ornate gardens , he heard a noise that made him almost involuntarily stop . It was the unmistakable noise of a pistol or carbine or some light firearm discharged ; but it was not this that puzzled him most . The first full noise was immediately followed by a series of fainter noises -- as he counted them , about six .
chesterton#He supposed it must be the echo ; but the odd thing was that the echo was not in the least like the original sound . It was not like anything else that he could think of ; the three things nearest to it seemed to be the noise made by siphons of soda - water , one of the many noises made by an animal , and the noise made by a person attempting to conceal laughter . None of which seemed to make much sense . Father Brown was made of two men . There was a man of action , who was as modest as a primrose and as punctual as a clock ; who went his small round of duties and never dreamed of altering it . There was also a man of reflection , who was much simpler but much stronger , who could not easily be stopped ; whose thought was always ( in the only intelligent sense of the words ) free thought .
chesterton#He could not help , even unconsciously , asking himself all the questions that there were to be asked , and answering as many of them as he could ; all that went on like his breathing or circulation . But he never consciously carried his actions outside the sphere of his own duty ; and in this case the two attitudes were aptly tested . He was just about to resume his trudge in the twilight , telling himself it was no affair of his , but instinctively twisting and untwisting twenty theories about what the odd noises might mean . Then the grey sky - line brightened into silver , and in the broadening light he realized that he had been to the house which belonged to an Anglo - Indian Major named Putnam ; and that the Major had a native cook from Malta who was of his communion . He also began to remember that pistol - shots are sometimes serious things ; accompanied with consequences with which he was legitimately concerned . He turned back and went in at the garden gate , making for the front door .
chesterton#Half - way down one side of the house stood out a projection like a very low shed ; it was , as he afterwards discovered , a large dustbin . Round the corner of this came a figure , at first a mere shadow in the haze , apparently bending and peering about . Then , coming nearer , it solidified into a figure that was , indeed , rather unusually solid . Major Putnam was a bald - headed , bull - necked man , short and very broad , with one of those rather apoplectic faces that are produced by a prolonged attempt to combine the oriental climate with the occidental luxuries . But the face was a good - humoured one , and even now , though evidently puzzled and inquisitive , wore a kind of innocent grin . He had a large palm - leaf hat on the back of his head ( suggesting a halo that was by no means appropriate to the face ), but otherwise he was clad only in a very vivid suit of striped scarlet and yellow pyjamas ; which , though glowing enough to behold , must have been , on a fresh morning , pretty chilly to wear .
chesterton#"He had evidently come out of his house in a hurry , and the priest was not surprised when he called out without further ceremony : "" Did you hear that noise ?"" "" Yes ,"" answered Father Brown ; "" I thought I had better look in , in case anything was the matter ."" The Major looked at him rather queerly with his good - humoured gooseberry eyes . "" What do you think the noise was ?"" he asked . "" It sounded like a gun or something ,"" replied the other , with some hesitation ; "" but it seemed to have a singular sort of echo ."""
chesterton#"The Major was still looking at him quietly , but with protruding eyes , when the front door was flung open , releasing a flood of gaslight on the face of the fading mist ; and another figure in pyjamas sprang or tumbled out into the garden . The figure was much longer , leaner , and more athletic ; the pyjamas , though equally tropical , were comparatively tasteful , being of white with a light lemon - yellow stripe . The man was haggard , but handsome , more sunburned than the other ; he had an aquiline profile and rather deep - sunken eyes , and a slight air of oddity arising from the combination of coal - black hair with a much lighter moustache . All this Father Brown absorbed in detail more at leisure . For the moment he only saw one thing about the man ; which was the revolver in his hand . "" Cray !"""
chesterton#"exclaimed the Major , staring at him ; "" did you fire that shot ?"" "" Yes , I did ,"" retorted the black - haired gentleman hotly ; "" and so would you in my place . If you were chased everywhere by devils and nearly --"" The Major seemed to intervene rather hurriedly . "" This is my friend Father Brown ,"" he said . And then to Brown : "" I don ' t know whether you ' ve met Colonel Cray of the Royal Artillery ."""
chesterton#""" I have heard of him , of course ,"" said the priest innocently . "" Did you -- did you hit anything ?"" "" I thought so ,"" answered Cray with gravity . "" Did he --"" asked Major Putnam in a lowered voice , "" did he fall or cry out , or anything ?"" Colonel Cray was regarding his host with a strange and steady stare . "" I ' ll tell you exactly what he did ,"" he said ."
chesterton#""" He sneezed ."" Father Brown ' s hand went half - way to his head , with the gesture of a man remembering somebody ' s name . He knew now what it was that was neither soda - water nor the snorting of a dog . "" Well ,"" ejaculated the staring Major , "" I never heard before that a service revolver was a thing to be sneezed at ."" "" Nor I ,"" said Father Brown faintly . "" It ' s lucky you didn ' t turn your artillery on him or you might have given him quite a bad cold ."""
chesterton#"Then , after a bewildered pause , he said : "" Was it a burglar ?"" "" Let us go inside ,"" said Major Putnam , rather sharply , and led the way into his house . The interior exhibited a paradox often to be marked in such morning hours : that the rooms seemed brighter than the sky outside ; even after the Major had turned out the one gaslight in the front hall . Father Brown was surprised to see the whole dining - table set out as for a festive meal , with napkins in their rings , and wine - glasses of some six unnecessary shapes set beside every plate . It was common enough , at that time of the morning , to find the remains of a banquet over - night ; but to find it freshly spread so early was unusual . While he stood wavering in the hall Major Putnam rushed past him and sent a raging eye over the whole oblong of the tablecloth ."
chesterton#"At last he spoke , spluttering : "" All the silver gone !"" he gasped . "" Fish - knives and forks gone . Old cruet - stand gone . Even the old silver cream - jug gone . And now , Father Brown , I am ready to answer your question of whether it was a burglar ."""
chesterton#""" They ' re simply a blind ,"" said Cray stubbornly . "" I know better than you why people persecute this house ; I know better than you why --"" The Major patted him on the shoulder with a gesture almost peculiar to the soothing of a sick child , and said : "" It was a burglar . Obviously it was a burglar ."" "" A burglar with a bad cold ,"" observed Father Brown , "" that might assist you to trace him in the neighbourhood ."" The Major shook his head in a sombre manner ."
chesterton#""" He must be far beyond trace now , I fear ,"" he said . Then , as the restless man with the revolver turned again towards the door in the garden , he added in a husky , confidential voice : "" I doubt whether I should send for the police , for fear my friend here has been a little too free with his bullets , and got on the wrong side of the law . He ' s lived in very wild places ; and , to be frank with you , I think he sometimes fancies things ."" "" I think you once told me ,"" said Brown , "" that he believes some Indian secret society is pursuing him ."" Major Putnam nodded , but at the same time shrugged his shoulders . "" I suppose we ' d better follow him outside ,"" he said ."
chesterton#""" I don ' t want any more -- shall we say , sneezing ?"" They passed out into the morning light , which was now even tinged with sunshine , and saw Colonel Cray ' s tall figure bent almost double , minutely examining the condition of gravel and grass . While the Major strolled unobtrusively towards him , the priest took an equally indolent turn , which took him round the next corner of the house to within a yard or two of the projecting dustbin . He stood regarding this dismal object for some minute and a half --, then he stepped towards it , lifted the lid and put his head inside . Dust and other discolouring matter shook upwards as he did so ; but Father Brown never observed his own appearance , whatever else he observed . He remained thus for a measurable period , as if engaged in some mysterious prayers ."
chesterton#Then he came out again , with some ashes on his hair , and walked unconcernedly away . By the time he came round to the garden door again he found a group there which seemed to roll away morbidities as the sunlight had already rolled away the mists . It was in no way rationally reassuring ; it was simply broadly comic , like a cluster of Dickens ' s characters . Major Putnam had managed to slip inside and plunge into a proper shirt and trousers , with a crimson cummerbund , and a light square jacket over all ; thus normally set off , his red festive face seemed bursting with a commonplace cordiality . He was indeed emphatic , but then he was talking to his cook -- the swarthy son of Malta , whose lean , yellow and rather careworn face contrasted quaintly with his snow - white cap and costume . The cook might well be careworn , for cookery was the Major ' s hobby .
chesterton#"He was one of those amateurs who always know more than the professional . The only other person he even admitted to be a judge of an omelette was his friend Cray -- and as Brown remembered this , he turned to look for the other officer . In the new presence of daylight and people clothed and in their right mind , the sight of him was rather a shock . The taller and more elegant man was still in his night - garb , with tousled black hair , and now crawling about the garden on his hands and knees , still looking for traces of the burglar ; and now and again , to all appearance , striking the ground with his hand in anger at not finding him . Seeing him thus quadrupedal in the grass , the priest raised his eyebrows rather sadly ; and for the first time guessed that "" fancies things "" might be an euphemism . The third item in the group of the cook and the epicure was also known to Father Brown ; it was Audrey Watson , the Major ' s ward and housekeeper ; and at this moment , to judge by her apron , tucked - up sleeves and resolute manner , much more the housekeeper than the ward ."
chesterton#""" It serves you right ,"" she was saying : "" I always told you not to have that old - fashioned cruet - stand ."" "" I prefer it ,"" said Putnam , placably . "" I ' m old - fashioned myself ; and the things keep together ."" "" And vanish together , as you see ,"" she retorted . "" Well , if you are not going to bother about the burglar , I shouldn ' t bother about the lunch . It ' s Sunday , and we can ' t send for vinegar and all that in the town ; and you Indian gentlemen can ' t enjoy what you call a dinner without a lot of hot things ."
chesterton#"I wish to goodness now you hadn ' t asked Cousin Oliver to take me to the musical service . It isn ' t over till half - past twelve , and the Colonel has to leave by then . I don ' t believe you men can manage alone ."" "" Oh yes , we can , my dear ,"" said the Major , looking at her very amiably . "" Marco has all the sauces , and we ' ve often done ourselves well in very rough places , as you might know by now . And it ' s time you had a treat , Audrey ; you mustn ' t be a housekeeper every hour of the day ; and I know you want to hear the music ."""
chesterton#""" I want to go to church ,"" she said , with rather severe eyes . She was one of those handsome women who will always be handsome , because the beauty is not in an air or a tint , but in the very structure of the head and features . But though she was not yet middle - aged and her auburn hair was of a Titianesque fullness in form and colour , there was a look in her mouth and around her eyes which suggested that some sorrows wasted her , as winds waste at last the edges of a Greek temple . For indeed the little domestic difficulty of which she was now speaking so decisively was rather comic than tragic . Father Brown gathered , from the course of the conversation , that Cray , the other gourmet , had to leave before the usual lunch - time ; but that Putnam , his host , not to be done out of a final feast with an old crony , had arranged for a special dejeuner to be set out and consumed in the course of the morning , while Audrey and other graver persons were at morning service . She was going there under the escort of a relative and old friend of hers , Dr Oliver Oman , who , though a scientific man of a somewhat bitter type , was enthusiastic for music , and would go even to church to get it ."
chesterton#"There was nothing in all this that could conceivably concern the tragedy in Miss Watson ' s face ; and by a half conscious instinct , Father Brown turned again to the seeming lunatic grubbing about in the grass . When he strolled across to him , the black , unbrushed head was lifted abruptly , as if in some surprise at his continued presence . And indeed , Father Brown , for reasons best known to himself , had lingered much longer than politeness required ; or even , in the ordinary sense , permitted . "" Well !"" cried Cray , with wild eyes . "" I suppose you think I ' m mad , like the rest ?"""
chesterton#""" I have considered the thesis ,"" answered the little man , composedly . "" And I incline to think you are not ."" "" What do you mean ?"" snapped Cray quite savagely . "" Real madmen ,"" explained Father Brown , "" always encourage their own morbidity . They never strive against it ."
chesterton#"But you are trying to find traces of the burglar ; even when there aren ' t any . You are struggling against it . You want what no madman ever wants ."" "" And what is that ?"" "" You want to be proved wrong ,"" said Brown . During the last words Cray had sprung or staggered to his feet and was regarding the cleric with agitated eyes ."
chesterton#""" By hell , but that is a true word !"" he cried . "" They are all at me here that the fellow was only after the silver -- as if I shouldn ' t be only too pleased to think so ! She ' s been at me ,"" and he tossed his tousled black head towards Audrey , but the other had no need of the direction , "" she ' s been at me today about how cruel I was to shoot a poor harmless house - breaker , and how I have the devil in me against poor harmless natives . But I was a good - natured man once -- as good - natured as Putnam ."" After a pause he said : "" Look here , I ' ve never seen you before ; but you shall judge of the whole story ."
chesterton#Old Putnam and I were friends in the same mess ; but , owing to some accidents on the Afghan border , I got my command much sooner than most men ; only we were both invalided home for a bit . I was engaged to Audrey out there ; and we all travelled back together . But on the journey back things happened . Curious things . The result of them was that Putnam wants it broken off , and even Audrey keeps it hanging on -- and I know what they mean . I know what they think I am .
chesterton#"So do you . "" Well , these are the facts . The last day we were in an Indian city I asked Putnam if I could get some Trichinopoli cigars , he directed me to a little place opposite his lodgings . I have since found he was quite right ; but ` opposite ' is a dangerous word when one decent house stands opposite five or six squalid ones ; and I must have mistaken the door . It opened with difficulty , and then only on darkness ; but as I turned back , the door behind me sank back and settled into its place with a noise as of innumerable bolts . There was nothing to do but to walk forward ; which I did through passage after passage , pitch - dark ."
chesterton#Then I came to a flight of steps , and then to a blind door , secured by a latch of elaborate Eastern ironwork , which I could only trace by touch , but which I loosened at last . I came out again upon gloom , which was half turned into a greenish twilight by a multitude of small but steady lamps below . They showed merely the feet or fringes of some huge and empty architecture . Just in front of me was something that looked like a mountain . I confess I nearly fell on the great stone platform on which I had emerged , to realize that it was an idol . And worst of all , an idol with its back to me .
chesterton#""" It was hardly half human , I guessed ; to judge by the small squat head , and still more by a thing like a tail or extra limb turned up behind and pointing , like a loathsome large finger , at some symbol graven in the centre of the vast stone back . I had begun , in the dim light , to guess at the hieroglyphic , not without horror , when a more horrible thing happened . A door opened silently in the temple wall behind me and a man came out , with a brown face and a black coat . He had a carved smile on his face , of copper flesh and ivory teeth ; but I think the most hateful thing about him was that he was in European dress . I was prepared , I think , for shrouded priests or naked fakirs . But this seemed to say that the devilry was over all the earth ."
chesterton#"As indeed I found it to be . ""` If you had only seen the Monkey ' s Feet ,' he said , smiling steadily , and without other preface , ` we should have been very gentle -- you would only be tortured and die . If you had seen the Monkey ' s Face , still we should be very moderate , very tolerant -- you would only be tortured and live . But as you have seen the Monkey ' s Tail , we must pronounce the worst sentence . which is -- Go Free .' "" When he said the words I heard the elaborate iron latch with which I had struggled , automatically unlock itself : and then , far down the dark passages I had passed , I heard the heavy street - door shifting its own bolts backwards ."
chesterton#"""` It is vain to ask for mercy ; you must go free ,' said the smiling man . ` Henceforth a hair shall slay you like a sword , and a breath shall bite you like an adder ; weapons shall come against you out of nowhere ; and you shall die many times .' And with that he was swallowed once more in the wall behind ; and I went out into the street ."" Cray paused ; and Father Brown unaffectedly sat down on the lawn and began to pick daisies . Then the soldier continued : "" Putnam , of course , with his jolly common sense , pooh - poohed all my fears ; and from that time dates his doubt of my mental balance . Well , I ' ll simply tell you , in the fewest words , the three things that have happened since ; and you shall judge which of us is right ."
chesterton#""" The first happened in an Indian village on the edge of the jungle , but hundreds of miles from the temple , or town , or type of tribes and customs where the curse had been put on me . I woke in black midnight , and lay thinking of nothing in particular , when I felt a faint tickling thing , like a thread or a hair , trailed across my throat . I shrank back out of its way , and could not help thinking of the words in the temple . But when I got up and sought lights and a mirror , the line across my neck was a line of blood . "" The second happened in a lodging in Port Said , later , on our journey home together . It was a jumble of tavern and curiosity - shop ; and though there was nothing there remotely suggesting the cult of the Monkey , it is , of course , possible that some of its images or talismans were in such a place ."
chesterton#"Its curse was there , anyhow . I woke again in the dark with a sensation that could not be put in colder or more literal words than that a breath bit like an adder . Existence was an agony of extinction ; I dashed my head against walls until I dashed it against a window ; and fell rather than jumped into the garden below . Putnam , poor fellow , who had called the other thing a chance scratch , was bound to take seriously the fact of finding me half insensible on the grass at dawn . But I fear it was my mental state he took seriously ; and not my story . "" The third happened in Malta ."
chesterton#We were in a fortress there ; and as it happened our bedrooms overlooked the open sea , which almost came up to our window - sills , save for a flat white outer wall as bare as the sea . I woke up again ; but it was not dark . There was a full moon , as I walked to the window ; I could have seen a bird on the bare battlement , or a sail on the horizon . What I did see was a sort of stick or branch circling , self - supported , in the empty sky . It flew straight in at my window and smashed the lamp beside the pillow I had just quitted . It was one of those queer - shaped war - clubs some Eastern tribes use .
chesterton#"But it had come from no human hand ."" Father Brown threw away a daisy - chain he was making , and rose with a wistful look . "" Has Major Putnam ,"" he asked , "" got any Eastern curios , idols , weapons and so on , from which one might get a hint ?"" "" Plenty of those , though not much use , I fear ,"" replied Cray ; "" but by all means come into his study ."" As they entered they passed Miss Watson buttoning her gloves for church , and heard the voice of Putnam downstairs still giving a lecture on cookery to the cook . In the Major ' s study and den of curios they came suddenly on a third party , silk - hatted and dressed for the street , who was poring over an open book on the smoking - table -- a book which he dropped rather guiltily , and turned ."
chesterton#"Cray introduced him civilly enough , as Dr Oman , but he showed such disfavour in his very face that Brown guessed the two men , whether Audrey knew it or not , were rivals . Nor was the priest wholly unsympathetic with the prejudice . Dr Oman was a very well - dressed gentleman indeed ; well - featured , though almost dark enough for an Asiatic . But Father Brown had to tell himself sharply that one should be in charity even with those who wax their pointed beards , who have small gloved hands , and who speak with perfectly modulated voices . Cray seemed to find something specially irritating in the small prayer - book in Oman ' s dark - gloved hand . "" I didn ' t know that was in your line ,"" he said rather rudely ."
chesterton#"Oman laughed mildly , but without offence . "" This is more so , I know ,"" he said , laying his hand on the big book he had dropped , "" a dictionary of drugs and such things . But it ' s rather too large to take to church ."" Then he closed the larger book , and there seemed again the faintest touch of hurry and embarrassment . "" I suppose ,"" said the priest , who seemed anxious to change the subject , "" all these spears and things are from India ?"" "" From everywhere ,"" answered the doctor ."
chesterton#""" Putnam is an old soldier , and has been in Mexico and Australia , and the Cannibal Islands for all I know ."" "" I hope it was not in the Cannibal Islands ,"" said Brown , "" that he learnt the art of cookery ."" And he ran his eyes over the stew - pots or other strange utensils on the wall . At this moment the jolly subject of their conversation thrust his laughing , lobsterish face into the room . "" Come along , Cray ,"" he cried . "" Your lunch is just coming in ."
chesterton#"And the bells are ringing for those who want to go to church ."" Cray slipped upstairs to change ; Dr Oman and Miss Watson betook themselves solemnly down the street , with a string of other churchgoers ; but Father Brown noticed that the doctor twice looked back and scrutinized the house ; and even came back to the corner of the street to look at it again . The priest looked puzzled . "" He can ' t have been at the dustbin ,"" he muttered . "" Not in those clothes . Or was he there earlier today ?"""
chesterton#"Father Brown , touching other people , was as sensitive as a barometer ; but today he seemed about as sensitive as a rhinoceros . By no social law , rigid or implied , could he be supposed to linger round the lunch of the Anglo - Indian friends ; but he lingered , covering his position with torrents of amusing but quite needless conversation . He was the more puzzling because he did not seem to want any lunch . As one after another of the most exquisitely balanced kedgerees of curries , accompanied with their appropriate vintages , were laid before the other two , he only repeated that it was one of his fast - days , and munched a piece of bread and sipped and then left untasted a tumbler of cold water . His talk , however , was exuberant . "" I ' ll tell you what I ' ll do for you ,"" he cried --, "" I ' ll mix you a salad !"
chesterton#"I can ' t eat it , but I ' ll mix it like an angel ! You ' ve got a lettuce there ."" "" Unfortunately it ' s the only thing we have got ,"" answered the good - humoured Major . "" You must remember that mustard , vinegar , oil and so on vanished with the cruet and the burglar ."" "" I know ,"" replied Brown , rather vaguely . "" That ' s what I ' ve always been afraid would happen ."
chesterton#"That ' s why I always carry a cruet - stand about with me . I ' m so fond of salads ."" And to the amazement of the two men he took a pepper - pot out of his waistcoat pocket and put it on the table . "" I wonder why the burglar wanted mustard , too ,"" he went on , taking a mustard - pot from another pocket . "" A mustard plaster , I suppose . And vinegar ""-- and producing that condiment -- "" haven ' t I heard something about vinegar and brown paper ?"
chesterton#"As for oil , which I think I put in my left --"" His garrulity was an instant arrested ; for lifting his eyes , he saw what no one else saw -- the black figure of Dr Oman standing on the sunlit lawn and looking steadily into the room . Before he could quite recover himself Cray had cloven in . "" You ' re an astounding card ,"" he said , staring . "" I shall come and hear your sermons , if they ' re as amusing as your manners ."" His voice changed a little , and he leaned back in his chair ."
chesterton#""" Oh , there are sermons in a cruet - stand , too ,"" said Father Brown , quite gravely . "" Have you heard of faith like a grain of mustard - seed ; or charity that anoints with oil ? And as for vinegar , can any soldiers forget that solitary soldier , who , when the sun was darkened --"" Colonel Cray leaned forward a little and clutched the tablecloth . Father Brown , who was making the salad , tipped two spoonfuls of the mustard into the tumbler of water beside him ; stood up and said in a new , loud and sudden voice --"" Drink that !"" At the same moment the motionless doctor in the garden came running , and bursting open a window cried : "" Am I wanted ?"
chesterton#"Has he been poisoned ?"" "" Pretty near ,"" said Brown , with the shadow of a smile ; for the emetic had very suddenly taken effect . And Cray lay in a deck - chair , gasping as for life , but alive . Major Putnam had sprung up , his purple face mottled . "" A crime !"" he cried hoarsely ."
chesterton#""" I will go for the police !"" The priest could hear him dragging down his palm - leaf hat from the peg and tumbling out of the front door ; he heard the garden gate slam . But he only stood looking at Cray ; and after a silence said quietly : "" I shall not talk to you much ; but I will tell you what you want to know . There is no curse on you . The Temple of the Monkey was either a coincidence or a part of the trick ; the trick was the trick of a white man ."
chesterton#"There is only one weapon that will bring blood with that mere feathery touch : a razor held by a white man . There is one way of making a common room full of invisible , overpowering poison : turning on the gas -- the crime of a white man . And there is only one kind of club that can be thrown out of a window , turn in mid - air and come back to the window next to it : the Australian boomerang . You ' ll see some of them in the Major ' s study ."" With that he went outside and spoke for a moment to the doctor . The moment after , Audrey Watson came rushing into the house and fell on her knees beside Cray ' s chair ."
chesterton#"He could not hear what they said to each other ; but their faces moved with amazement , not unhappiness . The doctor and the priest walked slowly towards the garden gate . "" I suppose the Major was in love with her , too ,"" he said with a sigh ; and when the other nodded , observed : "" You were very generous , doctor . You did a fine thing . But what made you suspect ?"" "" A very small thing ,"" said Oman ; "" but it kept me restless in church till I came back to see that all was well ."
chesterton#"That book on his table was a work on poisons ; and was put down open at the place where it stated that a certain Indian poison , though deadly and difficult to trace , was particularly easily reversible by the use of the commonest emetics . I suppose he read that at the last moment --"" "" And remembered that there were emetics in the cruet - stand ,"" said Father Brown . "" Exactly . He threw the cruet in the dustbin -- where I found it , along with other silver -- for the sake of a burglary blind . But if you look at that pepper - pot I put on the table , you ' ll see a small hole ."
chesterton#"That ' s where Cray ' s bullet struck , shaking up the pepper and making the criminal sneeze ."" There was a silence . Then Dr Oman said grimly : "" The Major is a long time looking for the police ."" "" Or the police in looking for the Major ?"" said the priest . "" Well , good - bye ."""
chesterton#"XI . The Strange Crime of John Boulnois MR CALHOUN KIDD was a very young gentleman with a very old face , a face dried up with its own eagerness , framed in blue - black hair and a black butterfly tie . He was the emissary in England of the colossal American daily called the Western Sun -- also humorously described as the "" Rising Sunset "". This was in allusion to a great journalistic declaration ( attributed to Mr Kidd himself ) that "" he guessed the sun would rise in the west yet , if American citizens did a bit more hustling ."" Those , however , who mock American journalism from the standpoint of somewhat mellower traditions forget a certain paradox which partly redeems it ."
chesterton#"For while the journalism of the States permits a pantomimic vulgarity long past anything English , it also shows a real excitement about the most earnest mental problems , of which English papers are innocent , or rather incapable . The Sun was full of the most solemn matters treated in the most farcical way . William James figured there as well as "" Weary Willie ,"" and pragmatists alternated with pugilists in the long procession of its portraits . Thus , when a very unobtrusive Oxford man named John Boulnois wrote in a very unreadable review called the Natural Philosophy Quarterly a series of articles on alleged weak points in Darwinian evolution , it fluttered no corner of the English papers ; though Boulnois ' s theory ( which was that of a comparatively stationary universe visited occasionally by convulsions of change ) had some rather faddy fashionableness at Oxford , and got so far as to be named "" Catastrophism "". But many American papers seized on the challenge as a great event ; and the Sun threw the shadow of Mr Boulnois quite gigantically across its pages . By the paradox already noted , articles of valuable intelligence and enthusiasm were presented with headlines apparently written by an illiterate maniac , headlines such as "" Darwin Chews Dirt ; Critic Boulnois says He Jumps the Shocks ""-- or "" Keep Catastrophic , says Thinker Boulnois ."""
chesterton#And Mr Calhoun Kidd , of the Western Sun , was bidden to take his butterfly tie and lugubrious visage down to the little house outside Oxford where Thinker Boulnois lived in happy ignorance of such a title . That fated philosopher had consented , in a somewhat dazed manner , to receive the interviewer , and had named the hour of nine that evening . The last of a summer sunset clung about Cumnor and the low wooded hills ; the romantic Yankee was both doubtful of his road and inquisitive about his surroundings ; and seeing the door of a genuine feudal old - country inn , The Champion Arms , standing open , he went in to make inquiries . In the bar parlour he rang the bell , and had to wait some little time for a reply to it . The only other person present was a lean man with close red hair and loose , horsey - looking clothes , who was drinking very bad whisky , but smoking a very good cigar . The whisky , of course , was the choice brand of The Champion Arms ; the cigar he had probably brought with him from London .
chesterton#"Nothing could be more different than his cynical negligence from the dapper dryness of the young American ; but something in his pencil and open notebook , and perhaps in the expression of his alert blue eye , caused Kidd to guess , correctly , that he was a brother journalist . "" Could you do me the favour ,"" asked Kidd , with the courtesy of his nation , "" of directing me to the Grey Cottage , where Mr Boulnois lives , as I understand ?"" "" It ' s a few yards down the road ,"" said the red - haired man , removing his cigar ; "" I shall be passing it myself in a minute , but I ' m going on to Pendragon Park to try and see the fun ."" "" What is Pendragon Park ?"" asked Calhoun Kidd . "" Sir Claude Champion ' s place -- haven ' t you come down for that , too ?"""
chesterton#"asked the other pressman , looking up . "" You ' re a journalist , aren ' t you ?"" "" I have come to see Mr Boulnois ,"" said Kidd . "" I ' ve come to see Mrs Boulnois ,"" replied the other . "" But I shan ' t catch her at home ."" And he laughed rather unpleasantly ."
chesterton#""" Are you interested in Catastrophism ?"" asked the wondering Yankee . "" I ' m interested in catastrophes ; and there are going to be some ,"" replied his companion gloomily . "" Mine ' s a filthy trade , and I never pretend it isn ' t ."" With that he spat on the floor ; yet somehow in the very act and instant one could realize that the man had been brought up as a gentleman . The American pressman considered him with more attention ."
chesterton#His face was pale and dissipated , with the promise of formidable passions yet to be loosed ; but it was a clever and sensitive face ; his clothes were coarse and careless , but he had a good seal ring on one of his long , thin fingers . His name , which came out in the course of talk , was James Dalroy ; he was the son of a bankrupt Irish landlord , and attached to a pink paper which he heartily despised , called Smart Society , in the capacity of reporter and of something painfully like a spy . Smart Society , I regret to say , felt none of that interest in Boulnois on Darwin which was such a credit to the head and hearts of the Western Sun . Dalroy had come down , it seemed , to snuff up the scent of a scandal which might very well end in the Divorce Court , but which was at present hovering between Grey Cottage and Pendragon Park . Sir Claude Champion was known to the readers of the Western Sun as well as Mr Boulnois . So were the Pope and the Derby Winner ; but the idea of their intimate acquaintanceship would have struck Kidd as equally incongruous .
chesterton#"He had heard of ( and written about , nay , falsely pretended to know ) Sir Claude Champion , as "" one of the brightest and wealthiest of England ' s Upper Ten ""; as the great sportsman who raced yachts round the world ; as the great traveller who wrote books about the Himalayas , as the politician who swept constituencies with a startling sort of Tory Democracy , and as the great dabbler in art , music , literature , and , above all , acting . Sir Claude was really rather magnificent in other than American eyes . There was something of the Renascence Prince about his omnivorous culture and restless publicity --, he was not only a great amateur , but an ardent one . There was in him none of that antiquarian frivolity that we convey by the word "" dilettante "". That faultless falcon profile with purple - black Italian eye , which had been snap - shotted so often both for Smart Society and the Western Sun , gave everyone the impression of a man eaten by ambition as by a fire , or even a disease . But though Kidd knew a great deal about Sir Claude -- a great deal more , in fact , than there was to know -- it would never have crossed his wildest dreams to connect so showy an aristocrat with the newly - unearthed founder of Catastrophism , or to guess that Sir Claude Champion and John Boulnois could be intimate friends ."
chesterton#Such , according to Dalroy ' s account , was nevertheless the fact . The two had hunted in couples at school and college , and , though their social destinies had been very different ( for Champion was a great landlord and almost a millionaire , while Boulnois was a poor scholar and , until just lately , an unknown one ), they still kept in very close touch with each other . Indeed , Boulnois ' s cottage stood just outside the gates of Pendragon Park . But whether the two men could be friends much longer was becoming a dark and ugly question . A year or two before , Boulnois had married a beautiful and not unsuccessful actress , to whom he was devoted in his own shy and ponderous style ; and the proximity of the household to Champion ' s had given that flighty celebrity opportunities for behaving in a way that could not but cause painful and rather base excitement . Sir Claude had carried the arts of publicity to perfection ; and he seemed to take a crazy pleasure in being equally ostentatious in an intrigue that could do him no sort of honour .
chesterton#"Footmen from Pendragon were perpetually leaving bouquets for Mrs Boulnois ; carriages and motor - cars were perpetually calling at the cottage for Mrs Boulnois ; balls and masquerades perpetually filled the grounds in which the baronet paraded Mrs Boulnois , like the Queen of Love and Beauty at a tournament . That very evening , marked by Mr Kidd for the exposition of Catastrophism , had been marked by Sir Claude Champion for an open - air rendering of Romeo and Juliet , in which he was to play Romeo to a Juliet it was needless to name . "" I don ' t think it can go on without a smash ,"" said the young man with red hair , getting up and shaking himself . "" Old Boulnois may be squared -- or he may be square . But if he ' s square he ' s thick -- what you might call cubic . But I don ' t believe it ' s possible ."""
chesterton#""" He is a man of grand intellectual powers ,"" said Calhoun Kidd in a deep voice . "" Yes ,"" answered Dalroy ; "" but even a man of grand intellectual powers can ' t be such a blighted fool as all that . Must you be going on ? I shall be following myself in a minute or two ."" But Calhoun Kidd , having finished a milk and soda , betook himself smartly up the road towards the Grey Cottage , leaving his cynical informant to his whisky and tobacco . The last of the daylight had faded ; the skies were of a dark , green - grey , like slate , studded here and there with a star , but lighter on the left side of the sky , with the promise of a rising moon ."
chesterton#"The Grey Cottage , which stood entrenched , as it were , in a square of stiff , high thorn - hedges , was so close under the pines and palisades of the Park that Kidd at first mistook it for the Park Lodge . Finding the name on the narrow wooden gate , however , and seeing by his watch that the hour of the "" Thinker ' s "" appointment had just struck , he went in and knocked at the front door . Inside the garden hedge , he could see that the house , though unpretentious enough , was larger and more luxurious than it looked at first , and was quite a different kind of place from a porter ' s lodge . A dog - kennel and a beehive stood outside , like symbols of old English country - life ; the moon was rising behind a plantation of prosperous pear trees , the dog that came out of the kennel was reverend - looking and reluctant to bark ; and the plain , elderly man - servant who opened the door was brief but dignified . "" Mr Boulnois asked me to offer his apologies , sir ,"" he said , "" but he has been obliged to go out suddenly ."" "" But see here , I had an appointment ,"" said the interviewer , with a rising voice ."
chesterton#""" Do you know where he went to ?"" "" To Pendragon Park , sir ,"" said the servant , rather sombrely , and began to close the door . Kidd started a little . "" Did he go with Mrs -- with the rest of the party ?"" he asked rather vaguely . "" No , sir ,"" said the man shortly ; "" he stayed behind , and then went out alone ."""
chesterton#"And he shut the door , brutally , but with an air of duty not done . The American , that curious compound of impudence and sensitiveness , was annoyed . He felt a strong desire to hustle them all along a bit and teach them business habits ; the hoary old dog and the grizzled , heavy - faced old butler with his prehistoric shirt - front , and the drowsy old moon , and above all the scatter - brained old philosopher who couldn ' t keep an appointment . "" If that ' s the way he goes on he deserves to lose his wife ' s purest devotion ,"" said Mr Calhoun Kidd . "" But perhaps he ' s gone over to make a row . In that case I reckon a man from the Western Sun will be on the spot ."""
chesterton#"And turning the corner by the open lodge - gates , he set off , stumping up the long avenue of black pine - woods that pointed in abrupt perspective towards the inner gardens of Pendragon Park . The trees were as black and orderly as plumes upon a hearse ; there were still a few stars . He was a man with more literary than direct natural associations ; the word "" Ravenswood "" came into his head repeatedly . It was partly the raven colour of the pine - woods ; but partly also an indescribable atmosphere almost described in Scott ' s great tragedy ; the smell of something that died in the eighteenth century ; the smell of dank gardens and broken urns , of wrongs that will never now be righted ; of something that is none the less incurably sad because it is strangely unreal . More than once , as he went up that strange , black road of tragic artifice , he stopped , startled , thinking he heard steps in front of him . He could see nothing in front but the twin sombre walls of pine and the wedge of starlit sky above them ."
chesterton#At first he thought he must have fancied it or been mocked by a mere echo of his own tramp . But as he went on he was more and more inclined to conclude , with the remains of his reason , that there really were other feet upon the road . He thought hazily of ghosts ; and was surprised how swiftly he could see the image of an appropriate and local ghost , one with a face as white as Pierrot ' s , but patched with black . The apex of the triangle of dark - blue sky was growing brighter and bluer , but he did not realize as yet that this was because he was coming nearer to the lights of the great house and garden . He only felt that the atmosphere was growing more intense , there was in the sadness more violence and secrecy -- more -- he hesitated for the word , and then said it with a jerk of laughter -- Catastrophism . More pines , more pathway slid past him , and then he stood rooted as by a blast of magic .
chesterton#It is vain to say that he felt as if he had got into a dream ; but this time he felt quite certain that he had got into a book . For we human beings are used to inappropriate things ; we are accustomed to the clatter of the incongruous ; it is a tune to which we can go to sleep . If one appropriate thing happens , it wakes us up like the pang of a perfect chord . Something happened such as would have happened in such a place in a forgotten tale . Over the black pine - wood came flying and flashing in the moon a naked sword -- such a slender and sparkling rapier as may have fought many an unjust duel in that ancient park . It fell on the pathway far in front of him and lay there glistening like a large needle .
chesterton#He ran like a hare and bent to look at it . Seen at close quarters it had rather a showy look : the big red jewels in the hilt and guard were a little dubious . But there were other red drops upon the blade which were not dubious . He looked round wildly in the direction from which the dazzling missile had come , and saw that at this point the sable facade of fir and pine was interrupted by a smaller road at right angles ; which , when he turned it , brought him in full view of the long , lighted house , with a lake and fountains in front of it . Nevertheless , he did not look at this , having something more interesting to look at . Above him , at the angle of the steep green bank of the terraced garden , was one of those small picturesque surprises common in the old landscape gardening ; a kind of small round hill or dome of grass , like a giant mole - hill , ringed and crowned with three concentric fences of roses , and having a sundial in the highest point in the centre .
chesterton#Kidd could see the finger of the dial stand up dark against the sky like the dorsal fin of a shark and the vain moonlight clinging to that idle clock . But he saw something else clinging to it also , for one wild moment -- the figure of a man . Though he saw it there only for a moment , though it was outlandish and incredible in costume , being clad from neck to heel in tight crimson , with glints of gold , yet he knew in one flash of moonlight who it was . That white face flung up to heaven , clean - shaven and so unnaturally young , like Byron with a Roman nose , those black curls already grizzled -- he had seen the thousand public portraits of Sir Claude Champion . The wild red figure reeled an instant against the sundial ; the next it had rolled down the steep bank and lay at the American ' s feet , faintly moving one arm . A gaudy , unnatural gold ornament on the arm suddenly reminded Kidd of Romeo and Juliet ; of course the tight crimson suit was part of the play .
chesterton#But there was a long red stain down the bank from which the man had rolled -- that was no part of the play . He had been run through the body . Mr Calhoun Kidd shouted and shouted again . Once more he seemed to hear phantasmal footsteps , and started to find another figure already near him . He knew the figure , and yet it terrified him . The dissipated youth who had called himself Dalroy had a horribly quiet way with him ; if Boulnois failed to keep appointments that had been made , Dalroy had a sinister air of keeping appointments that hadn ' t .
chesterton#"The moonlight discoloured everything , against Dalroy ' s red hair his wan face looked not so much white as pale green . All this morbid impressionism must be Kidd ' s excuse for having cried out , brutally and beyond all reason : "" Did you do this , you devil ?"" James Dalroy smiled his unpleasing smile ; but before he could speak , the fallen figure made another movement of the arm , waving vaguely towards the place where the sword fell ; then came a moan , and then it managed to speak . "" Boulnois .... Boulnois , I say .... Boulnois did it ... jealous of me ... he was jealous , he was , he was ..."" Kidd bent his head down to hear more , and just managed to catch the words : "" Boulnois ... with my own sword ... he threw it ..."""
chesterton#"Again the failing hand waved towards the sword , and then fell rigid with a thud . In Kidd rose from its depth all that acrid humour that is the strange salt of the seriousness of his race . "" See here ,"" he said sharply and with command , "" you must fetch a doctor . This man ' s dead ."" "" And a priest , too , I suppose ,"" said Dalroy in an undecipherable manner . "" All these Champions are papists ."""
chesterton#"The American knelt down by the body , felt the heart , propped up the head and used some last efforts at restoration ; but before the other journalist reappeared , followed by a doctor and a priest , he was already prepared to assert they were too late . "" Were you too late also ?"" asked the doctor , a solid prosperous - looking man , with conventional moustache and whiskers , but a lively eye , which darted over Kidd dubiously . "" In one sense ,"" drawled the representative of the Sun . "" I was too late to save the man , but I guess I was in time to hear something of importance . I heard the dead man denounce his assassin ."""
chesterton#""" And who was the assassin ?"" asked the doctor , drawing his eyebrows together . "" Boulnois ,"" said Calhoun Kidd , and whistled softly . The doctor stared at him gloomily with a reddening brow --, but he did not contradict . Then the priest , a shorter figure in the background , said mildly : "" I understood that Mr Boulnois was not coming to Pendragon Park this evening ."" "" There again ,"" said the Yankee grimly , "" I may be in a position to give the old country a fact or two ."
chesterton#"Yes , sir , John Boulnois was going to stay in all this evening ; he fixed up a real good appointment there with me . But John Boulnois changed his mind ; John Boulnois left his home abruptly and all alone , and came over to this darned Park an hour or so ago . His butler told me so . I think we hold what the all - wise police call a clue -- have you sent for them ?"" "" Yes ,"" said the doctor , "" but we haven ' t alarmed anyone else yet ."" "" Does Mrs Boulnois know ?"""
chesterton#"asked James Dalroy , and again Kidd was conscious of an irrational desire to hit him on his curling mouth . "" I have not told her ,"" said the doctor gruffly --, "" but here come the police ."" The little priest had stepped out into the main avenue , and now returned with the fallen sword , which looked ludicrously large and theatrical when attached to his dumpy figure , at once clerical and commonplace . "" Just before the police come ,"" he said apologetically , "" has anyone got a light ?"" The Yankee journalist took an electric torch from his pocket , and the priest held it close to the middle part of the blade , which he examined with blinking care . Then , without glancing at the point or pommel , he handed the long weapon to the doctor ."
chesterton#""" I fear I ' m no use here ,"" he said , with a brief sigh . "" I ' ll say good night to you , gentlemen ."" And he walked away up the dark avenue towards the house , his hands clasped behind him and his big head bent in cogitation . The rest of the group made increased haste towards the lodge - gates , where an inspector and two constables could already be seen in consultation with the lodge - keeper . But the little priest only walked slower and slower in the dim cloister of pine , and at last stopped dead , on the steps of the house . It was his silent way of acknowledging an equally silent approach ; for there came towards him a presence that might have satisfied even Calhoun Kidd ' s demands for a lovely and aristocratic ghost ."
chesterton#"It was a young woman in silvery satins of a Renascence design ; she had golden hair in two long shining ropes , and a face so startingly pale between them that she might have been chryselephantine -- made , that is , like some old Greek statues , out of ivory and gold . But her eyes were very bright , and her voice , though low , was confident . "" Father Brown ?"" she said . "" Mrs Boulnois ?"" he replied gravely ."
chesterton#"Then he looked at her and immediately said : "" I see you know about Sir Claude ."" "" How do you know I know ?"" she asked steadily . He did not answer the question , but asked another : "" Have you seen your husband ?"" "" My husband is at home ,"" she said . "" He has nothing to do with this ."""
chesterton#"Again he did not answer ; and the woman drew nearer to him , with a curiously intense expression on her face . "" Shall I tell you something more ?"" she said , with a rather fearful smile . "" I don ' t think he did it , and you don ' t either ."" Father Brown returned her gaze with a long , grave stare , and then nodded , yet more gravely . "" Father Brown ,"" said the lady , "" I am going to tell you all I know , but I want you to do me a favour first ."
chesterton#"Will you tell me why you haven ' t jumped to the conclusion of poor John ' s guilt , as all the rest have done ? Don ' t mind what you say : I -- I know about the gossip and the appearances that are against me ."" Father Brown looked honestly embarrassed , and passed his hand across his forehead . "" Two very little things ,"" he said . "" At least , one ' s very trivial and the other very vague . But such as they are , they don ' t fit in with Mr Boulnois being the murderer ."""
chesterton#"He turned his blank , round face up to the stars and continued absentmindedly : "" To take the vague idea first . I attach a good deal of importance to vague ideas . All those things that ` aren ' t evidence ' are what convince me . I think a moral impossibility the biggest of all impossibilities . I know your husband only slightly , but I think this crime of his , as generally conceived , something very like a moral impossibility . Please do not think I mean that Boulnois could not be so wicked ."
chesterton#Anybody can be wicked -- as wicked as he chooses . We can direct our moral wills ; but we can ' t generally change our instinctive tastes and ways of doing things . Boulnois might commit a murder , but not this murder . He would not snatch Romeo ' s sword from its romantic scabbard ; or slay his foe on the sundial as on a kind of altar ; or leave his body among the roses , or fling the sword away among the pines . If Boulnois killed anyone he ' d do it quietly and heavily , as he ' d do any other doubtful thing -- take a tenth glass of port , or read a loose Greek poet . No , the romantic setting is not like Boulnois .
chesterton#"It ' s more like Champion ."" "" Ah !"" she said , and looked at him with eyes like diamonds . "" And the trivial thing was this ,"" said Brown . "" There were finger - prints on that sword ; finger - prints can be detected quite a time after they are made if they ' re on some polished surface like glass or steel . These were on a polished surface ."
chesterton#"They were half - way down the blade of the sword . Whose prints they were I have no earthly clue ; but why should anybody hold a sword half - way down ? It was a long sword , but length is an advantage in lunging at an enemy . At least , at most enemies . At all enemies except one ."" "" Except one ,"" she repeated ."
chesterton#""" There is only one enemy ,"" said Father Brown , "" whom it is easier to kill with a dagger than a sword ."" "" I know ,"" said the woman . "" Oneself ."" There was a long silence , and then the priest said quietly but abruptly : "" Am I right , then ? Did Sir Claude kill himself ?"" "" Yes "" she said , with a face like marble ."
chesterton#""" I saw him do it ."" "" He died ,"" said Father Brown , "" for love of you ?"" An extraordinary expression flashed across her face , very different from pity , modesty , remorse , or anything her companion had expected : her voice became suddenly strong and full . "" I don ' t believe ,"" she said , "" he ever cared about me a rap . He hated my husband ."" "" Why ?"""
chesterton#"asked the other , and turned his round face from the sky to the lady . "" He hated my husband because ... it is so strange I hardly know how to say it ... because ..."" "" Yes ?"" said Brown patiently . "" Because my husband wouldn ' t hate him ."" Father Brown only nodded , and seemed still to be listening ; he differed from most detectives in fact and fiction in a small point -- he never pretended not to understand when he understood perfectly well ."
chesterton#"Mrs Boulnois drew near once more with the same contained glow of certainty . "" My husband ,"" she said , "" is a great man . Sir Claude Champion was not a great man : he was a celebrated and successful man . My husband has never been celebrated or successful ; and it is the solemn truth that he has never dreamed of being so . He no more expects to be famous for thinking than for smoking cigars . On all that side he has a sort of splendid stupidity ."
chesterton#"He has never grown up . He still liked Champion exactly as he liked him at school ; he admired him as he would admire a conjuring trick done at the dinner - table . But he couldn ' t be got to conceive the notion of envying Champion . And Champion wanted to be envied . He went mad and killed himself for that ."" "" Yes ,"" said Father Brown ; "" I think I begin to understand ."""
chesterton#""" Oh , don ' t you see ?"" she cried ; "" the whole picture is made for that -- the place is planned for it . Champion put John in a little house at his very door , like a dependant -- to make him feel a failure . He never felt it . He thinks no more about such things than -- than an absent - minded lion . Champion would burst in on John ' s shabbiest hours or homeliest meals with some dazzling present or announcement or expedition that made it like the visit of Haroun Alraschid , and John would accept or refuse amiably with one eye off , so to speak , like one lazy schoolboy agreeing or disagreeing with another ."
chesterton#"After five years of it John had not turned a hair ; and Sir Claude Champion was a monomaniac ."" "" And Haman began to tell them ,"" said Father Brown , "" of all the things wherein the king had honoured him ; and he said : ` All these things profit me nothing while I see Mordecai the Jew sitting in the gate .'"" "" The crisis came ,"" Mrs Boulnois continued , "" when I persuaded John to let me take down some of his speculations and send them to a magazine . They began to attract attention , especially in America , and one paper wanted to interview him . When Champion ( who was interviewed nearly every day ) heard of this late little crumb of success falling to his unconscious rival , the last link snapped that held back his devilish hatred . Then he began to lay that insane siege to my own love and honour which has been the talk of the shire ."
chesterton#You will ask me why I allowed such atrocious attentions . I answer that I could not have declined them except by explaining to my husband , and there are some things the soul cannot do , as the body cannot fly . Nobody could have explained to my husband . Nobody could do it now . If you said to him in so many words , ` Champion is stealing your wife ,' he would think the joke a little vulgar : that it could be anything but a joke -- that notion could find no crack in his great skull to get in by . Well , John was to come and see us act this evening , but just as we were starting he said he wouldn ' t ; he had got an interesting book and a cigar .
chesterton#"I told this to Sir Claude , and it was his death - blow . The monomaniac suddenly saw despair . He stabbed himself , crying out like a devil that Boulnois was slaying him ; he lies there in the garden dead of his own jealousy to produce jealousy , and John is sitting in the dining - room reading a book ."" There was another silence , and then the little priest said : "" There is only one weak point , Mrs Boulnois , in all your very vivid account . Your husband is not sitting in the dining - room reading a book . That American reporter told me he had been to your house , and your butler told him Mr Boulnois had gone to Pendragon Park after all ."""
chesterton#"Her bright eyes widened to an almost electric glare ; and yet it seemed rather bewilderment than confusion or fear . "" Why , what can you mean ?"" she cried . "" All the servants were out of the house , seeing the theatricals . And we don ' t keep a butler , thank goodness !"" Father Brown started and spun half round like an absurd teetotum ."
chesterton#""" What , what ?"" he cried seeming galvanized into sudden life . "" Look here -- I say -- can I make your husband hear if I go to the house ?"" "" Oh , the servants will be back by now ,"" she said , wondering . "" Right , right !"" rejoined the cleric energetically , and set off scuttling up the path towards the Park gates ."
chesterton#"He turned once to say : "" Better get hold of that Yankee , or ` Crime of John Boulnois ' will be all over the Republic in large letters ."" "" You don ' t understand ,"" said Mrs Boulnois . "" He wouldn ' t mind . I don ' t think he imagines that America really is a place ."" When Father Brown reached the house with the beehive and the drowsy dog , a small and neat maid - servant showed him into the dining - room , where Boulnois sat reading by a shaded lamp , exactly as his wife described him . A decanter of port and a wineglass were at his elbow ; and the instant the priest entered he noted the long ash stand out unbroken on his cigar ."
chesterton#""" He has been here for half an hour at least ,"" thought Father Brown . In fact , he had the air of sitting where he had sat when his dinner was cleared away . "" Don ' t get up , Mr Boulnois ,"" said the priest in his pleasant , prosaic way . "" I shan ' t interrupt you a moment . I fear I break in on some of your scientific studies ."" "" No ,"" said Boulnois ; "" I was reading ` The Bloody Thumb .'"""
chesterton#"He said it with neither frown nor smile , and his visitor was conscious of a certain deep and virile indifference in the man which his wife had called greatness . He laid down a gory yellow "" shocker "" without even feeling its incongruity enough to comment on it humorously . John Boulnois was a big , slow - moving man with a massive head , partly grey and partly bald , and blunt , burly features . He was in shabby and very old - fashioned evening - dress , with a narrow triangular opening of shirt - front : he had assumed it that evening in his original purpose of going to see his wife act Juliet . "" I won ' t keep you long from ` The Bloody Thumb ' or any other catastrophic affairs ,"" said Father Brown , smiling . "" I only came to ask you about the crime you committed this evening ."""
chesterton#"Boulnois looked at him steadily , but a red bar began to show across his broad brow ; and he seemed like one discovering embarrassment for the first time . "" I know it was a strange crime ,"" assented Brown in a low voice . "" Stranger than murder perhaps -- to you . The little sins are sometimes harder to confess than the big ones -- but that ' s why it ' s so important to confess them . Your crime is committed by every fashionable hostess six times a week : and yet you find it sticks to your tongue like a nameless atrocity ."" "" It makes one feel ,"" said the philosopher slowly , "" such a damned fool ."""
chesterton#""" I know ,"" assented the other , "" but one often has to choose between feeling a damned fool and being one ."" "" I can ' t analyse myself well ,"" went on Boulnois ; "" but sitting in that chair with that story I was as happy as a schoolboy on a half - holiday . It was security , eternity -- I can ' t convey it ... the cigars were within reach ... the matches were within reach ... the Thumb had four more appearances to ... it was not only a peace , but a plenitude . Then that bell rang , and I thought for one long , mortal minute that I couldn ' t get out of that chair -- literally , physically , muscularly couldn ' t . Then I did it like a man lifting the world , because I knew all the servants were out . I opened the front door , and there was a little man with his mouth open to speak and his notebook open to write in ."
chesterton#"I remembered the Yankee interviewer I had forgotten . His hair was parted in the middle , and I tell you that murder --"" "" I understand ,"" said Father Brown . "" I ' ve seen him ."" "" I didn ' t commit murder ,"" continued the Catastrophist mildly , "" but only perjury . I said I had gone across to Pendragon Park and shut the door in his face ."
chesterton#"That is my crime , Father Brown , and I don ' t know what penance you would inflict for it ."" "" I shan ' t inflict any penance ,"" said the clerical gentleman , collecting his heavy hat and umbrella with an air of some amusement ; "" quite the contrary . I came here specially to let you off the little penance which would otherwise have followed your little offence ."" "" And what ,"" asked Boulnois , smiling , "" is the little penance I have so luckily been let off ?"" "" Being hanged ,"" said Father Brown . XII ."
chesterton#The Fairy Tale of Father Brown THE picturesque city and state of Heiligwaldenstein was one of those toy kingdoms of which certain parts of the German Empire still consist . It had come under the Prussian hegemony quite late in history -- hardly fifty years before the fine summer day when Flambeau and Father Brown found themselves sitting in its gardens and drinking its beer . There had been not a little of war and wild justice there within living memory , as soon will be shown . But in merely looking at it one could not dismiss that impression of childishness which is the most charming side of Germany -- those little pantomime , paternal monarchies in which a king seems as domestic as a cook . The German soldiers by the innumerable sentry - boxes looked strangely like German toys , and the clean - cut battlements of the castle , gilded by the sunshine , looked the more like the gilt gingerbread .
chesterton#For it was brilliant weather . The sky was as Prussian a blue as Potsdam itself could require , but it was yet more like that lavish and glowing use of the colour which a child extracts from a shilling paint - box . Even the grey - ribbed trees looked young , for the pointed buds on them were still pink , and in a pattern against the strong blue looked like innumerable childish figures . Despite his prosaic appearance and generally practical walk of life , Father Brown was not without a certain streak of romance in his composition , though he generally kept his daydreams to himself , as many children do . Amid the brisk , bright colours of such a day , and in the heraldic framework of such a town , he did feel rather as if he had entered a fairy tale . He took a childish pleasure , as a younger brother might , in the formidable sword - stick which Flambeau always flung as he walked , and which now stood upright beside his tall mug of Munich .
chesterton#"Nay , in his sleepy irresponsibility , he even found himself eyeing the knobbed and clumsy head of his own shabby umbrella , with some faint memories of the ogre ' s club in a coloured toy - book . But he never composed anything in the form of fiction , unless it be the tale that follows : "" I wonder ,"" he said , "" whether one would have real adventures in a place like this , if one put oneself in the way ? It ' s a splendid back - scene for them , but I always have a kind of feeling that they would fight you with pasteboard sabres more than real , horrible swords ."" "" You are mistaken ,"" said his friend . "" In this place they not only fight with swords , but kill without swords ."
chesterton#"And there ' s worse than that ."" "" Why , what do you mean ?"" asked Father Brown . "" Why ,"" replied the other , "" I should say this was the only place in Europe where a man was ever shot without firearms ."" "" Do you mean a bow and arrow ?"" asked Brown in some wonder ."
chesterton#""" I mean a bullet in the brain ,"" replied Flambeau . "" Don ' t you know the story of the late Prince of this place ? It was one of the great police mysteries about twenty years ago . You remember , of course , that this place was forcibly annexed at the time of Bismarck ' s very earliest schemes of consolidation -- forcibly , that is , but not at all easily . The empire ( or what wanted to be one ) sent Prince Otto of Grossenmark to rule the place in the Imperial interests . We saw his portrait in the gallery there -- a handsome old gentleman if he ' d had any hair or eyebrows , and hadn ' t been wrinkled all over like a vulture ; but he had things to harass him , as I ' ll explain in a minute ."
chesterton#He was a soldier of distinguished skill and success , but he didn ' t have altogether an easy job with this little place . He was defeated in several battles by the celebrated Arnhold brothers -- the three guerrilla patriots to whom Swinburne wrote a poem , you remember : Wolves with the hair of the ermine , Crows that are crowned and kings -- These things be many as vermin , Yet Three shall abide these things . Or something of that kind . Indeed , it is by no means certain that the occupation would ever have been successful had not one of the three brothers , Paul , despicably , but very decisively declined to abide these things any longer , and , by surrendering all the secrets of the insurrection , ensured its overthrow and his own ultimate promotion to the post of chamberlain to Prince Otto . After this , Ludwig , the one genuine hero among Mr Swinburne ' s heroes , was killed , sword in hand , in the capture of the city ; and the third , Heinrich , who , though not a traitor , had always been tame and even timid compared with his active brothers , retired into something like a hermitage , became converted to a Christian quietism which was almost Quakerish , and never mixed with men except to give nearly all he had to the poor .
chesterton#"They tell me that not long ago he could still be seen about the neighbourhood occasionally , a man in a black cloak , nearly blind , with very wild , white hair , but a face of astonishing softness ."" "" I know ,"" said Father Brown . "" I saw him once ."" His friend looked at him in some surprise . "" I didn ' t know you ' d been here before ,"" he said . "" Perhaps you know as much about it as I do ."
chesterton#"Anyhow , that ' s the story of the Arnholds , and he was the last survivor of them . Yes , and of all the men who played parts in that drama ."" "" You mean that the Prince , too , died long before ?"" "" Died ,"" repeated Flambeau , "" and that ' s about as much as we can say . You must understand that towards the end of his life he began to have those tricks of the nerves not uncommon with tyrants . He multiplied the ordinary daily and nightly guard round his castle till there seemed to be more sentry - boxes than houses in the town , and doubtful characters were shot without mercy ."
chesterton#"He lived almost entirely in a little room that was in the very centre of the enormous labyrinth of all the other rooms , and even in this he erected another sort of central cabin or cupboard , lined with steel , like a safe or a battleship . Some say that under the floor of this again was a secret hole in the earth , no more than large enough to hold him , so that , in his anxiety to avoid the grave , he was willing to go into a place pretty much like it . But he went further yet . The populace had been supposed to be disarmed ever since the suppression of the revolt , but Otto now insisted , as governments very seldom insist , on an absolute and literal disarmament . It was carried out , with extraordinary thoroughness and severity , by very well - organized officials over a small and familiar area , and , so far as human strength and science can be absolutely certain of anything , Prince Otto was absolutely certain that nobody could introduce so much as a toy pistol into Heiligwaldenstein ."" "" Human science can never be quite certain of things like that ,"" said Father Brown , still looking at the red budding of the branches over his head , "" if only because of the difficulty about definition and connotation ."
chesterton#"What is a weapon ? People have been murdered with the mildest domestic comforts ; certainly with tea - kettles , probably with tea - cosies . On the other hand , if you showed an Ancient Briton a revolver , I doubt if he would know it was a weapon -- until it was fired into him , of course . Perhaps somebody introduced a firearm so new that it didn ' t even look like a firearm . Perhaps it looked like a thimble or something . Was the bullet at all peculiar ?"""
chesterton#""" Not that I ever heard of ,"" answered Flambeau ; "" but my information is fragmentary , and only comes from my old friend Grimm . He was a very able detective in the German service , and he tried to arrest me ; I arrested him instead , and we had many interesting chats . He was in charge here of the inquiry about Prince Otto , but I forgot to ask him anything about the bullet . According to Grimm , what happened was this ."" He paused a moment to drain the greater part of his dark lager at a draught , and then resumed : "" On the evening in question , it seems , the Prince was expected to appear in one of the outer rooms , because he had to receive certain visitors whom he really wished to meet ."
chesterton#"They were geological experts sent to investigate the old question of the alleged supply of gold from the rocks round here , upon which ( as it was said ) the small city - state had so long maintained its credit and been able to negotiate with its neighbours even under the ceaseless bombardment of bigger armies . Hitherto it had never been found by the most exacting inquiry which could --"" "" Which could be quite certain of discovering a toy pistol ,"" said Father Brown with a smile . "" But what about the brother who ratted ? Hadn ' t he anything to tell the Prince ?"" "" He always asseverated that he did not know ,"" replied Flambeau ; "" that this was the one secret his brothers had not told him ."
chesterton#It is only right to say that it received some support from fragmentary words -- spoken by the great Ludwig in the hour of death , when he looked at Heinrich but pointed at Paul , and said , ` You have not told him ...' and was soon afterwards incapable of speech . Anyhow , the deputation of distinguished geologists and mineralogists from Paris and Berlin were there in the most magnificent and appropriate dress , for there are no men who like wearing their decorations so much as the men of science -- as anybody knows who has ever been to a soiree of the Royal Society . It was a brilliant gathering , but very late , and gradually the Chamberlain -- you saw his portrait , too : a man with black eyebrows , serious eyes , and a meaningless sort of smile underneath -- the Chamberlain , I say , discovered there was everything there except the Prince himself . He searched all the outer salons ; then , remembering the man ' s mad fits of fear , hurried to the inmost chamber . That also was empty , but the steel turret or cabin erected in the middle of it took some time to open . When it did open it was empty , too .
chesterton#"He went and looked into the hole in the ground , which seemed deeper and somehow all the more like a grave -- that is his account , of course . And even as he did so he heard a burst of cries and tumult in the long rooms and corridors without . "" First it was a distant din and thrill of something unthinkable on the horizon of the crowd , even beyond the castle . Next it was a wordless clamour startlingly close , and loud enough to be distinct if each word had not killed the other . Next came words of a terrible clearness , coming nearer , and next one man , rushing into the room and telling the news as briefly as such news is told . "" Otto , Prince of Heiligwaldenstein and Grossenmark , was lying in the dews of the darkening twilight in the woods beyond the castle , with his arms flung out and his face flung up to the moon ."
chesterton#"The blood still pulsed from his shattered temple and jaw , but it was the only part of him that moved like a living thing . He was clad in his full white and yellow uniform , as to receive his guests within , except that the sash or scarf had been unbound and lay rather crumpled by his side . Before he could be lifted he was dead . But , dead or alive , he was a riddle -- he who had always hidden in the inmost chamber out there in the wet woods , unarmed and alone ."" "" Who found his body ?"" asked Father Brown ."
chesterton#""" Some girl attached to the Court named Hedwig von something or other ,"" replied his friend , "" who had been out in the wood picking wild flowers ."" "" Had she picked any ?"" asked the priest , staring rather vacantly at the veil of the branches above him . "" Yes ,"" replied Flambeau . "" I particularly remember that the Chamberlain , or old Grimm or somebody , said how horrible it was , when they came up at her call , to see a girl holding spring flowers and bending over that -- that bloody collapse . However , the main point is that before help arrived he was dead , and the news , of course , had to be carried back to the castle ."
chesterton#"The consternation it created was something beyond even that natural in a Court at the fall of a potentate . The foreign visitors , especially the mining experts , were in the wildest doubt and excitement , as well as many important Prussian officials , and it soon began to be clear that the scheme for finding the treasure bulked much bigger in the business than people had supposed . Experts and officials had been promised great prizes or international advantages , and some even said that the Prince ' s secret apartments and strong military protection were due less to fear of the populace than to the pursuit of some private investigation of --"" "" Had the flowers got long stalks ?"" asked Father Brown . Flambeau stared at him ."
chesterton#""" What an odd person you are !"" he said . "" That ' s exactly what old Grimm said . He said the ugliest part of it , he thought -- uglier than the blood and bullet -- was that the flowers were quite short , plucked close under the head ."" "" Of course ,"" said the priest , "" when a grown up girl is really picking flowers , she picks them with plenty of stalk . If she just pulled their heads off , as a child does , it looks as if --"" And he hesitated ."
chesterton#""" Well ?"" inquired the other . "" Well , it looks rather as if she had snatched them nervously , to make an excuse for being there after -- well , after she was there ."" "" I know what you ' re driving at ,"" said Flambeau rather gloomily . "" But that and every other suspicion breaks down on the one point -- the want of a weapon . He could have been killed , as you say , with lots of other things -- even with his own military sash ; but we have to explain not bow he was killed , but how he was shot ."
chesterton#"And the fact is we can ' t . They had the girl most ruthlessly searched ; for , to tell the truth , she was a little suspect , though the niece and ward of the wicked old Chamberlain , Paul Arnhold . But she was very romantic , and was suspected of sympathy with the old revolutionary enthusiasm in her family . All the same , however romantic you are , you can ' t imagine a big bullet into a man ' s jaw or brain without using a gun or pistol . And there was no pistol , though there were two pistol shots . I leave it to you , my friend ."""
chesterton#""" How do you know there were two shots ?"" asked the little priest . "" There was only one in his head ,"" said his companion , "" but there was another bullet - hole in the sash ."" Father Brown ' s smooth brow became suddenly constricted . "" Was the other bullet found ?"" he demanded ."
chesterton#"Flambeau started a little . "" I don ' t think I remember ,"" he said . "" Hold on ! Hold on ! Hold on !"" cried Brown , frowning more and more , with a quite unusual concentration of curiosity ."
chesterton#""" Don ' t think me rude . Let me think this out for a moment ."" "" All right ,"" said Flambeau , laughing , and finished his beer . A slight breeze stirred the budding trees and blew up into the sky cloudlets of white and pink that seemed to make the sky bluer and the whole coloured scene more quaint . They might have been cherubs flying home to the casements of a sort of celestial nursery . The oldest tower of the castle , the Dragon Tower , stood up as grotesque as the ale - mug , but as homely ."
chesterton#"Only beyond the tower glimmered the wood in which the man had lain dead . "" What became of this Hedwig eventually ?"" asked the priest at last . "" She is married to General Schwartz ,"" said Flambeau . "" No doubt you ' ve heard of his career , which was rather romantic . He had distinguished himself even , before his exploits at Sadowa and Gravelotte ; in fact , he rose from the ranks , which is very unusual even in the smallest of the German ..."""
chesterton#"Father Brown sat up suddenly . "" Rose from the ranks !"" he cried , and made a mouth as if to whistle . "" Well , well , what a queer story ! What a queer way of killing a man ; but I suppose it was the only one possible . But to think of hate so patient --"""
chesterton#""" What do you mean ?"" demanded the other . "" In what way did they kill the man ?"" "" They killed him with the sash ,"" said Brown carefully ; and then , as Flambeau protested : "" Yes , yes , I know about the bullet . Perhaps I ought to say he died of having a sash . I know it doesn ' t sound like having a disease ."""
chesterton#""" I suppose ,"" said Flambeau , "" that you ' ve got some notion in your head , but it won ' t easily get the bullet out of his . As I explained before , he might easily have been strangled . But he was shot . By whom ? By what ?"" "" He was shot by his own orders ,"" said the priest ."
chesterton#""" You mean he committed suicide ?"" "" I didn ' t say by his own wish ,"" replied Father Brown . "" I said by his own orders ."" "" Well , anyhow , what is your theory ?"" Father Brown laughed . "" I am only on my holiday ,"" he said ."
chesterton#""" I haven ' t got any theories . Only this place reminds me of fairy stories , and , if you like , I ' ll tell you a story ."" The little pink clouds , that looked rather like sweet - stuff , had floated up to crown the turrets of the gilt gingerbread castle , and the pink baby fingers of the budding trees seemed spreading and stretching to reach them ; the blue sky began to take a bright violet of evening , when Father Brown suddenly spoke again : "" It was on a dismal night , with rain still dropping from the trees and dew already clustering , that Prince Otto of Grossenmark stepped hurriedly out of a side door of the castle and walked swiftly into the wood . One of the innumerable sentries saluted him , but he did not notice it . He had no wish to be specially noticed himself ."
chesterton#"He was glad when the great trees , grey and already greasy with rain , swallowed him up like a swamp . He had deliberately chosen the least frequented side of his palace , but even that was more frequented than he liked . But there was no particular chance of officious or diplomatic pursuit , for his exit had been a sudden impulse . All the full - dressed diplomatists he left behind were unimportant . He had realized suddenly that he could do without them . "" His great passion was not the much nobler dread of death , but the strange desire of gold ."
chesterton#"For this legend of the gold he had left Grossenmark and invaded Heiligwaldenstein . For this and only this he had bought the traitor and butchered the hero , for this he had long questioned and cross - questioned the false Chamberlain , until he had come to the conclusion that , touching his ignorance , the renegade really told the truth . For this he had , somewhat reluctantly , paid and promised money on the chance of gaining the larger amount ; and for this he had stolen out of his palace like a thief in the rain , for he had thought of another way to get the desire of his eyes , and to get it cheap . "" Away at the upper end of a rambling mountain path to which he was making his way , among the pillared rocks along the ridge that hangs above the town , stood the hermitage , hardly more than a cavern fenced with thorn , in which the third of the great brethren had long hidden himself from the world . He , thought Prince Otto , could have no real reason for refusing to give up the gold . He had known its place for years , and made no effort to find it , even before his new ascetic creed had cut him off from property or pleasures ."
chesterton#True , he had been an enemy , but he now professed a duty of having no enemies . Some concession to his cause , some appeal to his principles , would probably get the mere money secret out of him . Otto was no coward , in spite of his network of military precautions , and , in any case , his avarice was stronger than his fears . Nor was there much cause for fear . Since he was certain there were no private arms in the whole principality , he was a hundred times more certain there were none in the Quaker ' s little hermitage on the hill , where he lived on herbs , with two old rustic servants , and with no other voice of man for year after year . Prince Otto looked down with something of a grim smile at the bright , square labyrinths of the lamp - lit city below him .
chesterton#"For as far as the eye could see there ran the rifles of his friends , and not one pinch of powder for his enemies . Rifles ranked so close even to that mountain path that a cry from him would bring the soldiers rushing up the hill , to say nothing of the fact that the wood and ridge were patrolled at regular intervals ; rifles so far away , in the dim woods , dwarfed by distance , beyond the river , that an enemy could not slink into the town by any detour . And round the palace rifles at the west door and the east door , at the north door and the south , and all along the four facades linking them . He was safe . "" It was all the more clear when he had crested the ridge and found how naked was the nest of his old enemy . He found himself on a small platform of rock , broken abruptly by the three corners of precipice ."
chesterton#"Behind was the black cave , masked with green thorn , so low that it was hard to believe that a man could enter it . In front was the fall of the cliffs and the vast but cloudy vision of the valley . On the small rock platform stood an old bronze lectern or reading - stand , groaning under a great German Bible . The bronze or copper of it had grown green with the eating airs of that exalted place , and Otto had instantly the thought , "" Even if they had arms , they must be rusted by now ."" Moonrise had already made a deathly dawn behind the crests and crags , and the rain had ceased . "" Behind the lectern , and looking across the valley , stood a very old man in a black robe that fell as straight as the cliffs around him , but whose white hair and weak voice seemed alike to waver in the wind ."
chesterton#"He was evidently reading some daily lesson as part of his religious exercises . "" They trust in their horses ..."" ""` Sir ,' said the Prince of Heiligwaldenstein , with quite unusual courtesy , ` I should like only one word with you .' ""`... and in their chariots ,' went on the old man weakly , ` but we will trust in the name of the Lord of Hosts ....' His last words were inaudible , but he closed the book reverently and , being nearly blind , made a groping movement and gripped the reading - stand . Instantly his two servants slipped out of the low - browed cavern and supported him . They wore dull - black gowns like his own , but they had not the frosty silver on the hair , nor the frost - bitten refinement of the features ."
chesterton#"They were peasants , Croat or Magyar , with broad , blunt visages and blinking eyes . For the first time something troubled the Prince , but his courage and diplomatic sense stood firm . ""` I fear we have not met ,' he said , ` since that awful cannonade in which your poor brother died .' ""` All my brothers died ,' said the old man , still looking across the valley . Then , for one instant turning on Otto his drooping , delicate features , and the wintry hair that seemed to drip over his eyebrows like icicles , he added : ` You see , I am dead , too .' ""` I hope you ' ll understand ,' said the Prince , controlling himself almost to a point of conciliation , ` that I do not come here to haunt you , as a mere ghost of those great quarrels ."
chesterton#"We will not talk about who was right or wrong in that , but at least there was one point on which we were never wrong , because you were always right . Whatever is to be said of the policy of your family , no one for one moment imagines that you were moved by the mere gold ; you have proved yourself above the suspicion that ...' "" The old man in the black gown had hitherto continued to gaze at him with watery blue eyes and a sort of weak wisdom in his face . But when the word ` gold ' was said he held out his hand as if in arrest of something , and turned away his face to the mountains . ""` He has spoken of gold ,' he said . ` He has spoken of things not lawful ."
chesterton#"Let him cease to speak .' "" Otto had the vice of his Prussian type and tradition , which is to regard success not as an incident but as a quality . He conceived himself and his like as perpetually conquering peoples who were perpetually being conquered . Consequently , he was ill acquainted with the emotion of surprise , and ill prepared for the next movement , which startled and stiffened him . He had opened his mouth to answer the hermit , when the mouth was stopped and the voice strangled by a strong , soft gag suddenly twisted round his head like a tourniquet . It was fully forty seconds before he even realized that the two Hungarian servants had done it , and that they had done it with his own military scarf ."
chesterton#""" The old man went again weakly to his great brazen - supported Bible , turned over the leaves , with a patience that had something horrible about it , till he came to the Epistle of St James , and then began to read : ` The tongue is a little member , but --' "" Something in the very voice made the Prince turn suddenly and plunge down the mountain - path he had climbed . He was half - way towards the gardens of the palace before he even tried to tear the strangling scarf from his neck and jaws . He tried again and again , and it was impossible ; the men who had knotted that gag knew the difference between what a man can do with his hands in front of him and what he can do with his hands behind his head . His legs were free to leap like an antelope on the mountains , his arms were free to use any gesture or wave any signal , but he could not speak . A dumb devil was in him ."
chesterton#""" He had come close to the woods that walled in the castle before he had quite realized what his wordless state meant and was meant to mean . Once more he looked down grimly at the bright , square labyrinths of the lamp - lit city below him , and he smiled no more . He felt himself repeating the phrases of his former mood with a murderous irony . Far as the eye could see ran the rifles of his friends , every one of whom would shoot him dead if he could not answer the challenge . Rifles were so near that the wood and ridge could be patrolled at regular intervals ; therefore it was useless to hide in the wood till morning . Rifles were ranked so far away that an enemy could not slink into the town by any detour ; therefore it was vain to return to the city by any remote course ."
chesterton#"A cry from him would bring his soldiers rushing up the hill . But from him no cry would come . "" The moon had risen in strengthening silver , and the sky showed in stripes of bright , nocturnal blue between the black stripes of the pines about the castle . Flowers of some wide and feathery sort -- for he had never noticed such things before -- were at once luminous and discoloured by the moonshine , and seemed indescribably fantastic as they clustered , as if crawling about the roots of the trees . Perhaps his reason had been suddenly unseated by the unnatural captivity he carried with him , but in that wood he felt something unfathomably German -- the fairy tale . He knew with half his mind that he was drawing near to the castle of an ogre -- he had forgotten that he was the ogre ."
chesterton#"He remembered asking his mother if bears lived in the old park at home . He stooped to pick a flower , as if it were a charm against enchantment . The stalk was stronger than he expected , and broke with a slight snap . Carefully trying to place it in his scarf , he heard the halloo , ` Who goes there ?' Then he remembered the scarf was not in its usual place . "" He tried to scream and was silent ."
chesterton#"The second challenge came ; and then a shot that shrieked as it came and then was stilled suddenly by impact . Otto of Grossenmark lay very peacefully among the fairy trees , and would do no more harm either with gold or steel ; only the silver pencil of the moon would pick out and trace here and there the intricate ornament of his uniform , or the old wrinkles on his brow . May God have mercy on his soul . "" The sentry who had fired , according to the strict orders of the garrison , naturally ran forward to find some trace of his quarry . He was a private named Schwartz , since not unknown in his profession , and what he found was a bald man in uniform , but with his face so bandaged by a kind of mask made of his own military scarf that nothing but open , dead eyes could be seen , glittering stonily in the moonlight . The bullet had gone through the gag into the jaw ; that is why there was a shot - hole in the scarf , but only one shot ."
chesterton#"Naturally , if not correctly , young Schwartz tore off the mysterious silken mask and cast it on the grass ; and then he saw whom he had slain . "" We cannot be certain of the next phase . But I incline to believe that there was a fairy tale , after all , in that little wood , horrible as was its occasion . Whether the young lady named Hedwig had any previous knowledge of the soldier she saved and eventually married , or whether she came accidentally upon the accident and their intimacy began that night , we shall probably never know . But we can know , I fancy , that this Hedwig was a heroine , and deserved to marry a man who became something of a hero . She did the bold and the wise thing ."
chesterton#"She persuaded the sentry to go back to his post , in which place there was nothing to connect him with the disaster ; he was but one of the most loyal and orderly of fifty such sentries within call . She remained by the body and gave the alarm ; and there was nothing to connect her with the disaster either , since she had not got , and could not have , any firearms . "" Well ,"" said Father Brown rising cheerfully "" I hope they ' re happy ."" "" Where are you going ?"" asked his friend . "" I ' m going to have another look at that portrait of the Chamberlain , the Arnhold who betrayed his brethren ,"" answered the priest ."
chesterton#""" I wonder what part -- I wonder if a man is less a traitor when he is twice a traitor ?"" And he ruminated long before the portrait of a white - haired man with black eyebrows and a pink , painted sort of smile that seemed to contradict the black warning in his eyes ."
chesterton#"He ' s rationalistic , and , what ' s worse , he ' s rich . When duty and religion are really destroyed , it will be by the rich ."" "" They are really destroyed now ,"" said the man with a cigarette , and rose with his hands in his pockets . "" The devils are coming on !"" The men in the motor - car looked anxiously in the direction of his dreamy gaze , and they saw that the whole regiment at the end of the road was advancing upon them , Dr . Renard marching furiously in front , his beard flying in the breeze . The Colonel sprang out of the car with an intolerant exclamation ."
chesterton#""" Gentlemen ,"" he cried , "" the thing is incredible . It must be a practical joke . If you knew Renard as I do -- it ' s like calling Queen Victoria a dynamiter . If you had got the man ' s character into your head --"" "" Dr . Bull ,"" said Syme sardonically , "" has at least got it into his hat ."" "" I tell you it can ' t be !"""
chesterton#"cried the Colonel , stamping . "" Renard shall explain it . He shall explain it to me ,"" and he strode forward . "" Don ' t be in such a hurry ,"" drawled the smoker . "" He will very soon explain it to all of us ."" But the impatient Colonel was already out of earshot , advancing towards the advancing enemy ."
chesterton#"The excited Dr . Renard lifted his pistol again , but perceiving his opponent , hesitated , and the Colonel came face to face with him with frantic gestures of remonstrance . "" It is no good ,"" said Syme . "" He will never get anything out of that old heathen . I vote we drive bang through the thick of them , bang as the bullets went through Bull ' s hat . We may all be killed , but we must kill a tidy number of them ."" "" I won ' t ' ave it ,"" said Dr . Bull , growing more vulgar in the sincerity of his virtue ."
chesterton#""" The poor chaps may be making a mistake . Give the Colonel a chance ."" "" Shall we go back , then ?"" asked the Professor . "" No ,"" said Ratcliffe in a cold voice , "" the street behind us is held too . In fact , I seem to see there another friend of yours , Syme ."""
chesterton#"Syme spun round smartly , and stared backwards at the track which they had travelled . He saw an irregular body of horsemen gathering and galloping towards them in the gloom . He saw above the foremost saddle the silver gleam of a sword , and then as it grew nearer the silver gleam of an old man ' s hair . The next moment , with shattering violence , he had swung the motor round and sent it dashing down the steep side street to the sea , like a man that desired only to die . "" What the devil is up ?"" cried the Professor , seizing his arm ."
chesterton#""" The morning star has fallen !"" said Syme , as his own car went down the darkness like a falling star . The others did not understand his words , but when they looked back at the street above they saw the hostile cavalry coming round the corner and down the slopes after them ; and foremost of all rode the good innkeeper , flushed with the fiery innocence of the evening light . "" The world is insane !"" said the Professor , and buried his face in his hands . "" No ,"" said Dr . Bull in adamantine humility , "" it is I ."""
chesterton#""" What are we going to do ?"" asked the Professor . "" At this moment ,"" said Syme , with a scientific detachment , "" I think we are going to smash into a lamppost ."" The next instant the automobile had come with a catastrophic jar against an iron object . The instant after that four men had crawled out from under a chaos of metal , and a tall lean lamp - post that had stood up straight on the edge of the marine parade stood out , bent and twisted , like the branch of a broken tree . "" Well , we smashed something ,"" said the Professor , with a faint smile ."
chesterton#""" That ' s some comfort ."" "" You ' re becoming an anarchist ,"" said Syme , dusting his clothes with his instinct of daintiness . "" Everyone is ,"" said Ratcliffe . As they spoke , the white - haired horseman and his followers came thundering from above , and almost at the same moment a dark string of men ran shouting along the sea - front . Syme snatched a sword , and took it in his teeth ; he stuck two others under his arm - pits , took a fourth in his left hand and the lantern in his right , and leapt off the high parade on to the beach below . The others leapt after him , with a common acceptance of such decisive action , leaving the debris and the gathering mob above them ."
chesterton#""" We have one more chance ,"" said Syme , taking the steel out of his mouth . "" Whatever all this pandemonium means , I suppose the police station will help us . We can ' t get there , for they hold the way . But there ' s a pier or breakwater runs out into the sea just here , which we could defend longer than anything else , like Horatius and his bridge . We must defend it till the Gendarmerie turn out . Keep after me ."""
chesterton#They followed him as he went crunching down the beach , and in a second or two their boots broke not on the sea gravel , but on broad , flat stones . They marched down a long , low jetty , running out in one arm into the dim , boiling sea , and when they came to the end of it they felt that they had come to the end of their story . They turned and faced the town . That town was transfigured with uproar . All along the high parade from which they had just descended was a dark and roaring stream of humanity , with tossing arms and fiery faces , groping and glaring towards them . The long dark line was dotted with torches and lanterns ; but even where no flame lit up a furious face , they could see in the farthest figure , in the most shadowy gesture , an organised hate .
chesterton#It was clear that they were the accursed of all men , and they knew not why . Two or three men , looking little and black like monkeys , leapt over the edge as they had done and dropped on to the beach . These came ploughing down the deep sand , shouting horribly , and strove to wade into the sea at random . The example was followed , and the whole black mass of men began to run and drip over the edge like black treacle . Foremost among the men on the beach Syme saw the peasant who had driven their cart . He splashed into the surf on a huge cart - horse , and shook his axe at them .
chesterton#""" The peasant !"" cried Syme . "" They have not risen since the Middle Ages ."" "" Even if the police do come now ,"" said the Professor mournfully , "" they can do nothing with this mob ."" "" Nonsence !"" said Bull desperately ; "" there must be some people left in the town who are human ."""
chesterton#""" No ,"" said the hopeless Inspector , "" the human being will soon be extinct . We are the last of mankind ."" "" It may be ,"" said the Professor absently . Then he added in his dreamy voice , "" What is all that at the end of the ' Dunciad '? ' Nor public flame ; nor private , dares to shine ; Nor human light is left , nor glimpse divine ! Lo !"
chesterton#"thy dread Empire , Chaos , is restored ; Light dies before thine uncreating word : Thy hand , great Anarch , lets the curtain fall ; And universal darkness buries all .""' "" Stop !"" cried Bull suddenly , "" the gendarmes are out ."" The low lights of the police station were indeed blotted and broken with hurrying figures , and they heard through the darkness the clash and jingle of a disciplined cavalry . "" They are charging the mob !"" cried Bull in ecstacy or alarm ."
chesterton#""" No ,"" said Syme , "" they are formed along the parade ."" "" They have unslung their carbines ,"" cried Bull dancing with excitement . "" Yes ,"" said Ratcliffe , "" and they are going to fire on us ."" As he spoke there came a long crackle of musketry , and bullets seemed to hop like hailstones on the stones in front of them . "" The gendarmes have joined them !"" cried the Professor , and struck his forehead ."
chesterton#""" I am in the padded cell ,"" said Bull solidly . There was a long silence , and then Ratcliffe said , looking out over the swollen sea , all a sort of grey purple -- "" What does it matter who is mad or who is sane ? We shall all be dead soon ."" Syme turned to him and said -- "" You are quite hopeless , then ?"""
chesterton#"Mr . Ratcliffe kept a stony silence ; then at last he said quietly -- "" No ; oddly enough I am not quite hopeless . There is one insane little hope that I cannot get out of my mind . The power of this whole planet is against us , yet I cannot help wondering whether this one silly little hope is hopeless yet ."" "" In what or whom is your hope ?"" asked Syme with curiosity ."
chesterton#""" In a man I never saw ,"" said the other , looking at the leaden sea . "" I know what you mean ,"" said Syme in a low voice , "" the man in the dark room . But Sunday must have killed him by now ."" "" Perhaps ,"" said the other steadily ; "" but if so , he was the only man whom Sunday found it hard to kill ."" "" I heard what you said ,"" said the Professor , with his back turned . "" I also am holding hard on to the thing I never saw ."""
chesterton#"All of a sudden Syme , who was standing as if blind with introspective thought , swung round and cried out , like a man waking from sleep -- "" Where is the Colonel ? I thought he was with us !"" "" The Colonel ! Yes ,"" cried Bull , "" where on earth is the Colonel ?"" "" He went to speak to Renard ,"" said the Professor ."
chesterton#""" We cannot leave him among all those beasts ,"" cried Syme . "" Let us die like gentlemen if --"" "" Do not pity the Colonel ,"" said Ratcliffe , with a pale sneer . "" He is extremely comfortable . He is --"" "" No !"
chesterton#"no ! no !"" cried Syme in a kind of frenzy , "" not the Colonel too ! I will never believe it !"" "" Will you believe your eyes ?"" asked the other , and pointed to the beach ."
chesterton#Many of their pursuers had waded into the water shaking their fists , but the sea was rough , and they could not reach the pier . Two or three figures , however , stood on the beginning of the stone footway , and seemed to be cautiously advancing down it . The glare of a chance lantern lit up the faces of the two foremost . One face wore a black half - mask , and under it the mouth was twisting about in such a madness of nerves that the black tuft of beard wriggled round and round like a restless , living thing . The other was the red face and white moustache of Colonel Ducroix . They were in earnest consultation .
chesterton#""" Yes , he is gone too ,"" said the Professor , and sat down on a stone . "" Everything ' s gone . I ' m gone ! I can ' t trust my own bodily machinery . I feel as if my own hand might fly up and strike me ."" "" When my hand flies up ,"" said Syme , "" it will strike somebody else ,"" and he strode along the pier towards the Colonel , the sword in one hand and the lantern in the other ."
chesterton#"As if to destroy the last hope or doubt , the Colonel , who saw him coming , pointed his revolver at him and fired . The shot missed Syme , but struck his sword , breaking it short at the hilt . Syme rushed on , and swung the iron lantern above his head . "" Judas before Herod !"" he said , and struck the Colonel down upon the stones . Then he turned to the Secretary , whose frightful mouth was almost foaming now , and held the lamp high with so rigid and arresting a gesture , that the man was , as it were , frozen for a moment , and forced to hear ."
chesterton#""" Do you see this lantern ?"" cried Syme in a terrible voice . "" Do you see the cross carved on it , and the flame inside ? You did not make it . You did not light it , Better men than you , men who could believe and obey , twisted the entrails of iron and preserved the legend of fire . There is not a street you walk on , there is not a thread you wear , that was not made as this lantern was , by denying your philosophy of dirt and rats ."
chesterton#"You can make nothing . You can only destroy . You will destroy mankind ; you will destroy the world . Let that suffice you . Yet this one old Christian lantern you shall not destroy . It shall go where your empire of apes will never have the wit to find it ."""
chesterton#"He struck the Secretary once with the lantern so that he staggered ; and then , whirling it twice round his head , sent it flying far out to sea , where it flared like a roaring rocket and fell . "" Swords !"" shouted Syme , turning his flaming face ; to the three behind him . "" Let us charge these dogs , for our time has come to die ."" His three companions came after him sword in hand . Syme ' s sword was broken , but he rent a bludgeon from the fist of a fisherman , flinging him down ."
chesterton#"In a moment they would have flung themselves upon the face of the mob and perished , when an interruption came . The Secretary , ever since Syme ' s speech , had stood with his hand to his stricken head as if dazed ; now he suddenly pulled off his black mask . The pale face thus peeled in the lamplight revealed not so much rage as astonishment . He put up his hand with an anxious authority . "" There is some mistake ,"" he said . "" Mr . Syme , I hardly think you understand your position ."
chesterton#"I arrest you in the name of the law ."" "" Of the law ?"" said Syme , and dropped his stick . "" Certainly !"" said the Secretary . "" I am a detective from Scotland Yard ,"" and he took a small blue card from his pocket ."
chesterton#""" And what do you suppose we are ?"" asked the Professor , and threw up his arms . "" You ,"" said the Secretary stiffly , "" are , as I know for a fact , members of the Supreme Anarchist Council . Disguised as one of you , I --"" Dr . Bull tossed his sword into the sea . "" There never was any Supreme Anarchist Council ,"" he said ."
chesterton#""" We were all a lot of silly policemen looking at each other . And all these nice people who have been peppering us with shot thought we were the dynamiters . I knew I couldn ' t be wrong about the mob ,"" he said , beaming over the enormous multitude , which stretched away to the distance on both sides . "" Vulgar people are never mad . I ' m vulgar myself , and I know . I am now going on shore to stand a drink to everybody here ."""
chesterton#CHAPTER XIII THE PURSUIT OF THE PRESIDENT NEXT morning five bewildered but hilarious people took the boat for Dover . The poor old Colonel might have had some cause to complain , having been first forced to fight for two factions that didn ' t exist , and then knocked down with an iron lantern . But he was a magnanimous old gentleman , and being much relieved that neither party had anything to do with dynamite , he saw them off on the pier with great geniality . The five reconciled detectives had a hundred details to explain to each other .
chesterton#The Secretary had to tell Syme how they had come to wear masks originally in order to approach the supposed enemy as fellow - conspirators ; Syme had to explain how they had fled with such swiftness through a civilised country . But above all these matters of detail which could be explained , rose the central mountain of the matter that they could not explain . What did it all mean ? If they were all harmless officers , what was Sunday ? If he had not seized the world , what on earth had he been up to ?
chesterton#"Inspector Ratcliffe was still gloomy about this . "" I can ' t make head or tail of old Sunday ' s little game any more than you can ,"" he said . "" But whatever else Sunday is , he isn ' t a blameless citizen . Damn it ! do you remember his face ?"" "" I grant you ,"" answered Syme , "" that I have never been able to forget it ."""
chesterton#""" Well ,"" said the Secretary , "" I suppose we can find out soon , for tomorrow we have our next general meeting . You will excuse me ,"" he said , with a rather ghastly smile , "" for being well acquainted with my secretarial duties ."" "" I suppose you are right ,"" said the Professor reflectively . "" I suppose we might find it out from him ; but I confess that I should feel a bit afraid of asking Sunday who he really is ."" "" Why ,"" asked the Secretary , "" for fear of bombs ?"" "" No ,"" said the Professor , "" for fear he might tell me ."""
chesterton#""" Let us have some drinks ,"" said Dr . Bull , after a silence . Throughout their whole journey by boat and train they were highly convivial , but they instinctively kept together . Dr . Bull , who had always been the optimist of the party , endeavoured to persuade the other four that the whole company could take the same hansom cab from Victoria ; but this was over - ruled , and they went in a four - wheeler , with Dr . Bull on the box , singing . They finished their journey at an hotel in Piccadilly Circus , so as to be close to the early breakfast next morning in Leicester Square . Yet even then the adventures of the day were not entirely over . Dr . Bull , discontented with the general proposal to go to bed , had strolled out of the hotel at about eleven to see and taste some of the beauties of London ."
chesterton#"Twenty minutes afterwards , however , he came back and made quite a clamour in the hall . Syme , who tried at first to soothe him , was forced at last to listen to his communication with quite new attention . "" I tell you I ' ve seen him !"" said Dr . Bull , with thick emphasis . "" Whom ?"" asked Syme quickly ."
chesterton#""" Not the President ?"" "" Not so bad as that ,"" said Dr . Bull , with unnecessary laughter , "" not so bad as that . I ' ve got him here ."" "" Got whom here ?"" asked Syme impatiently . "" Hairy man ,"" said the other lucidly , "" man that used to be hairy man -- Gogol ."
chesterton#"Here he is ,"" and he pulled forward by a reluctant elbow the identical young man who five days before had marched out of the Council with thin red hair and a pale face , the first of all the sham anarchists who had been exposed . "" Why do you worry with me ?"" he cried . "" You have expelled me as a spy ."" "" We are all spies !"" whispered Syme ."
chesterton#""" We ' re all spies !"" shouted Dr . Bull . "" Come and have a drink ."" Next morning the battalion of the reunited six marched stolidly towards the hotel in Leicester Square . "" This is more cheerful ,"" said Dr . Bull ; "" we are six men going to ask one man what he means ."" "" I think it is a bit queerer than that ,"" said Syme ."
chesterton#""" I think it is six men going to ask one man what they mean ."" They turned in silence into the Square , and though the hotel was in the opposite corner , they saw at once the little balcony and a figure that looked too big for it . He was sitting alone with bent head , poring over a newspaper . But all his councillors , who had come to vote him down , crossed that Square as if they were watched out of heaven by a hundred eyes . They had disputed much upon their policy , about whether they should leave the unmasked Gogol without and begin diplomatically , or whether they should bring him in and blow up the gunpowder at once . The influence of Syme and Bull prevailed for the latter course , though the Secretary to the last asked them why they attacked Sunday so rashly ."
chesterton#""" My reason is quite simple ,"" said Syme . "" I attack him rashly because I am afraid of him ."" They followed Syme up the dark stair in silence , and they all came out simultaneously into the broad sunlight of the morning and the broad sunlight of Sunday ' s smile . "" Delightful !"" he said . "" So pleased to see you all ."
chesterton#"What an exquisite day it is . Is the Czar dead ?"" The Secretary , who happened to be foremost , drew himself together for a dignified outburst . "" No , sir ,"" he said sternly "" there has been no massacre . I bring you news of no such disgusting spectacles ."" "" Disgusting spectacles ?"""
chesterton#"repeated the President , with a bright , inquiring smile . "" You mean Dr . Bull ' s spectacles ?"" The Secretary choked for a moment , and the President went on with a sort of smooth appeal -- "" Of course , we all have our opinions and even our eyes , but really to call them disgusting before the man himself --"" Dr . Bull tore off his spectacles and broke them on the table . "" My spectacles are blackguardly ,"" he said , "" but I ' m not ."
chesterton#"Look at my face ."" "" I dare say it ' s the sort of face that grows on one ,"" said the President , "" in fact , it grows on you ; and who am I to quarrel with the wild fruits upon the Tree of Life ? I dare say it will grow on me some day ."" "" We have no time for tomfoolery ,"" said the Secretary , breaking in savagely . "" We have come to know what all this means . Who are you ?"
chesterton#"What are you ? Why did you get us all here ? Do you know who and what we are ? Are you a half - witted man playing the conspirator , or are you a clever man playing the fool ? Answer me , I tell you ."" "" Candidates ,"" murmured Sunday , "" are only required to answer eight out of the seventeen questions on the paper ."
chesterton#"As far as I can make out , you want me to tell you what I am , and what you are , and what this table is , and what this Council is , and what this world is for all I know . Well , I will go so far as to rend the veil of one mystery . If you want to know what you are , you are a set of highly well - intentioned young jackasses ."" "" And you ,"" said Syme , leaning forward , "" what are you ?"" "" I ? What am I ?"""
chesterton#"roared the President , and he rose slowly to an incredible height , like some enormous wave about to arch above them and break . "" You want to know what I am , do you ? Bull , you are a man of science . Grub in the roots of those trees and find out the truth about them . Syme , you are a poet . Stare at those morning clouds ."
chesterton#"But I tell you this , that you will have found out the truth of the last tree and the top - most cloud before the truth about me . You will understand the sea , and I shall be still a riddle ; you shall know what the stars are , and not know what I am . Since the beginning of the world all men have hunted me like a wolf -- kings and sages , and poets and lawgivers , all the churches , and all the philosophies . But I have never been caught yet , and the skies will fall in the time I turn to bay . I have given them a good run for their money , and I will now ."" Before one of them could move , the monstrous man had swung himself like some huge ourang - outang over the balustrade of the balcony ."
chesterton#"Yet before he dropped he pulled himself up again as on a horizontal bar , and thrusting his great chin over the edge of the balcony , said solemnly -- "" There ' s one thing I ' ll tell you though about who I am . I am the man in the dark room , who made you all policemen ."" With that he fell from the balcony , bouncing on the stones below like a great ball of india - rubber , and went bounding off towards the corner of the Alhambra , where he hailed a hansom - cab and sprang inside it . The six detectives had been standing thunderstruck and livid in the light of his last assertion ; but when he disappeared into the cab , Syme ' s practical senses returned to him , and leaping over the balcony so recklessly as almost to break his legs , he called another cab . He and Bull sprang into the cab together , the Professor and the Inspector into another , while the Secretary and the late Gogol scrambled into a third just in time to pursue the flying Syme , who was pursuing the flying President ."
chesterton#"Sunday led them a wild chase towards the north - west , his cabman , evidently under the influence of more than common inducements , urging the horse at breakneck speed . But Syme was in no mood for delicacies , and he stood up in his own cab shouting , "" Stop thief !"" until crowds ran along beside his cab , and policemen began to stop and ask questions . All this had its influence upon the President ' s cabman , who began to look dubious , and to slow down to a trot . He opened the trap to talk reasonably to his fare , and in so doing let the long whip droop over the front of the cab . Sunday leant forward , seized it , and jerked it violently out of the man ' s hand ."
chesterton#Then standing up in front of the cab himself , he lashed the horse and roared aloud , so that they went down the streets like a flying storm . Through street after street and square after square went whirling this preposterous vehicle , in which the fare was urging the horse and the driver trying desperately to stop it . The other three cabs came after it ( if the phrase be permissible of a cab ) like panting hounds . Shops and streets shot by like rattling arrows . At the highest ecstacy of speed , Sunday turned round on the splashboard where he stood , and sticking his great grinning head out of the cab , with white hair whistling in the wind , he made a horrible face at his pursuers , like some colossal urchin . Then raising his right hand swiftly , he flung a ball of paper in Syme ' s face and vanished .
chesterton#"Syme caught the thing while instinctively warding it off , and discovered that it consisted of two crumpled papers . One was addressed to himself , and the other to Dr . Bull , with a very long , and it is to be feared partly ironical , string of letters after his name . Dr . Bull ' s address was , at any rate , considerably longer than his communication , for the communication consisted entirely of the words :-- "" What about Martin Tupper now ?"" "" What does the old maniac mean ?"" asked Bull , staring at the words ."
chesterton#""" What does yours say , Syme ?"" Syme ' s message was , at any rate , longer , and ran as follows :-- "" No one would regret anything in the nature of an interference by the Archdeacon more than I . I trust it will not come to that . But , for the last time , where are your goloshes ? The thing is too bad , especially after what uncle said ."" The President ' s cabman seemed to be regaining some control over his horse , and the pursuers gained a little as they swept round into the Edgware Road ."
chesterton#"And here there occurred what seemed to the allies a providential stoppage . Traffic of every kind was swerving to right or left or stopping , for down the long road was coming the unmistakable roar announcing the fire - engine , which in a few seconds went by like a brazen thunderbolt . But quick as it went by , Sunday had bounded out of his cab , sprung at the fire - engine , caught it , slung himself on to it , and was seen as he disappeared in the noisy distance talking to the astonished fireman with explanatory gestures . "" After him !"" howled Syme . "" He can ' t go astray now ."
chesterton#"There ' s no mistaking a fire - engine ."" The three cabmen , who had been stunned for a moment , whipped up their horses and slightly decreased the distance between themselves and their disappearing prey . The President acknowledged this proximity by coming to the back of the car , bowing repeatedly , kissing his hand , and finally flinging a neatly - folded note into the bosom of Inspector Ratcliffe . When that gentleman opened it , not without impatience , he found it contained the words :-- "" Fly at once . The truth about your trouser - stretchers is known ."
chesterton#"-- A FRIEND ."" The fire - engine had struck still farther to the north , into a region that they did not recognise ; and as it ran by a line of high railings shadowed with trees , the six friends were startled , but somewhat relieved , to see the President leap from the fire - engine , though whether through another whim or the increasing protest of his entertainers they could not see . Before the three cabs , however , could reach up to the spot , he had gone up the high railings like a huge grey cat , tossed himself over , and vanished in a darkness of leaves . Syme with a furious gesture stopped his cab , jumped out , and sprang also to the escalade . When he had one leg over the fence and his friends were following , he turned a face on them which shone quite pale in the shadow . "" What place can this be ?"""
chesterton#"he asked . "" Can it be the old devil ' s house ? I ' ve heard he has a house in North London ."" "" All the better ,"" said the Secretary grimly , planting a foot in a foothold , "" we shall find him at home ."" "" No , but it isn ' t that ,"" said Syme , knitting his brows . "" I hear the most horrible noises , like devils laughing and sneezing and blowing their devilish noses !"""
chesterton#""" His dogs barking , of course ,"" said the Secretary . "" Why not say his black - beetles barking !"" said Syme furiously , "" snails barking ! geraniums barking ! Did you ever hear a dog bark like that ?"" He held up his hand , and there came out of the thicket a long growling roar that seemed to get under the skin and freeze the flesh -- a low thrilling roar that made a throbbing in the air all about them ."
chesterton#""" The dogs of Sunday would be no ordinary dogs ,"" said Gogol , and shuddered . Syme had jumped down on the other side , but he still stood listening impatiently . "" Well , listen to that ,"" he said , "" is that a dog -- anybody ' s dog ?"" There broke upon their ear a hoarse screaming as of things protesting and clamouring in sudden pain ; and then , far off like an echo , what sounded like a long nasal trumpet . "" Well , his house ought to be hell !"" said the Secretary ; "" and if it is hell , I ' m going in !"""
chesterton#"and he sprang over the tall railings almost with one swing . The others followed . They broke through a tangle of plants and shrubs , and came out on an open path . Nothing was in sight , but Dr . Bull suddenly struck his hands together . "" Why , you asses ,"" he cried , "" it ' s the Zoo !"" As they were looking round wildly for any trace of their wild quarry , a keeper in uniform came running along the path with a man in plain clothes ."
chesterton#""" Has it come this way ?"" gasped the keeper . "" Has what ?"" asked Syme . "" The elephant !"" cried the keeper ."
chesterton#""" An elephant has gone mad and run away !"" "" He has run away with an old gentleman ,"" said the other stranger breathlessly , "" a poor old gentleman with white hair ! "" "" What sort of old gentleman ?"" asked Syme , with great curiosity . "" A very large and fat old gentleman in light grey clothes ,"" said the keeper eagerly . "" Well ,"" said Syme , "" if he ' s that particular kind of old gentleman , if you ' re quite sure that he ' s a large and fat old gentleman in grey clothes , you may take my word for it that the elephant has not run away with him ."
chesterton#"He has run away with the elephant . The elephant is not made by God that could run away with him if he did not consent to the elopement . And , by thunder , there he is !"" There was no doubt about it this time . Clean across the space of grass , about two hundred yards away , with a crowd screaming and scampering vainly at his heels , went a huge grey elephant at an awful stride , with his trunk thrown out as rigid as a ship ' s bowsprit , and trumpeting like the trumpet of doom . On the back of the bellowing and plunging animal sat President Sunday with all the placidity of a sultan , but goading the animal to a furious speed with some sharp object in his hand ."
chesterton#""" Stop him !"" screamed the populace . "" He ' ll be out of the gate !"" "" Stop a landslide !"" said the keeper . "" He is out of the gate !"""
chesterton#"And even as he spoke , a final crash and roar of terror announced that the great grey elephant had broken out of the gates of the Zoological Gardens , and was careening down Albany Street like a new and swift sort of omnibus . "" Great Lord !"" cried Bull , "" I never knew an elephant could go so fast . Well , it must be hansom - cabs again if we are to keep him in sight ."" As they raced along to the gate out of which the elephant had vanished , Syme felt a glaring panorama of the strange animals in the cages which they passed . Afterwards he thought it queer that he should have seen them so clearly ."
chesterton#He remembered especially seeing pelicans , with their preposterous , pendant throats . He wondered why the pelican was the symbol of charity , except it was that it wanted a good deal of charity to admire a pelican . He remembered a hornbill , which was simply a huge yellow beak with a small bird tied on behind it . The whole gave him a sensation , the vividness of which he could not explain , that Nature was always making quite mysterious jokes . Sunday had told them that they would understand him when they had understood the stars . He wondered whether even the archangels understood the hornbill .
chesterton#The six unhappy detectives flung themselves into cabs and followed the elephant sharing the terror which he spread through the long stretch of the streets . This time Sunday did not turn round , but offered them the solid stretch of his unconscious back , which maddened them , if possible , more than his previous mockeries . Just before they came to Baker Street , however , he was seen to throw something far up into the air , as a boy does a ball meaning to catch it again . But at their rate of racing it fell far behind , just by the cab containing Gogol ; and in faint hope of a clue or for some impulse unexplainable , he stopped his cab so as to pick it up . It was addressed to himself , and was quite a bulky parcel . On examination , however , its bulk was found to consist of thirty - three pieces of paper of no value wrapped one round the other .
chesterton#"When the last covering was torn away it reduced itself to a small slip of paper , on which was written :-- "" The word , I fancy , should be ' pink '."" The man once known as Gogol said nothing , but the movements of his hands and feet were like those of a man urging a horse to renewed efforts . Through street after street , through district after district , went the prodigy of the flying elephant , calling crowds to every window , and driving the traffic left and right . And still through all this insane publicity the three cabs toiled after it , until they came to be regarded as part of a procession , and perhaps the advertisement of a circus . They went at such a rate that distances were shortened beyond belief , and Syme saw the Albert Hall in Kensington when he thought that he was still in Paddington ."
chesterton#The animal ' s pace was even more fast and free through the empty , aristocratic streets of South Kensington , and he finally headed towards that part of the sky - line where the enormous Wheel of Earl ' s Court stood up in the sky . The wheel grew larger and larger , till it filled heaven like the wheel of stars . The beast outstripped the cabs . They lost him round several corners , and when they came to one of the gates of the Earl ' s Court Exhibition they found themselves finally blocked . In front of them was an enormous crowd ; in the midst of it was an enormous elephant , heaving and shuddering as such shapeless creatures do . But the President had disappeared .
chesterton#""" Where has he gone to ?"" asked Syme , slipping to the ground . "" Gentleman rushed into the Exhibition , sir !"" said an official in a dazed manner . Then he added in an injured voice : "" Funny gentleman , sir . Asked me to hold his horse , and gave me this ."""
chesterton#"He held out with distaste a piece of folded paper , addressed : "" To the Secretary of the Central Anarchist Council ."" The Secretary , raging , rent it open , and found written inside it :-- "" When the herring runs a mile , Let the Secretary smile ; When the herring tries to fly , Let the Secretary die . Rustic Proverb ."" "" Why the eternal crikey ,"" began the Secretary , "" did you let the man in ? Do people commonly come to you Exhibition riding on mad elephants ?"
chesterton#"Do --"" "" Look !"" shouted Syme suddenly . "" Look over there !"" "" Look at what ?"" asked the Secretary savagely ."
chesterton#""" Look at the captive balloon !"" said Syme , and pointed in a frenzy . "" Why the blazes should I look at a captive balloon ?' demanded the Secretary . "" What is there queer about a captive balloon ?"" "" Nothing ,"" said Syme , "" except that it isn ' t captive !'"
chesterton#"They all turned their eyes to where the balloon swung and swelled above the Exhibition on a string , like a child ' s balloon . A second afterwards the string came in two just under the car , and the balloon , broken loose , floated away with the freedom of a soap bubble . "" Ten thousand devils !"" shrieked the Secretary . "" He ' s got into it !"" and he shook his fists at the sky ."
chesterton#"The balloon , borne by some chance wind , came right above them , and they could see the great white head of the President peering over the side and looking benevolently down on them . "" God bless my soul !"" said the Professor with the elderly manner that he could never disconnect from his bleached beard and parchment face . "" God bless my soul ! I seemed to fancy that something fell on the top of my hat !"" He put up a trembling hand and took from that shelf a piece of twisted paper , which he opened absently only to find it inscribed with a true lover ' s knot and , the words :--"
chesterton#""" Your beauty has not left me indifferent .-- From LITTLE SNOWDROP . "" There was a short silence , and then Syme said , biting his beard -- "" I ' m not beaten yet . The blasted thing must come down somewhere . Let ' s follow it !"" CHAPTER XIV"
chesterton#THE SIX PHILOSOPHERS ACROSS green fields , and breaking through blooming hedges , toiled six draggled detectives , about five miles out of London . The optimist of the party had at first proposed that they should follow the balloon across South England in hansom - cabs . But he was ultimately convinced of the persistent refusal of the balloon to follow the roads , and the still more persistent refusal of the cabmen to follow the balloon . Consequently the tireless though exasperated travellers broke through black thickets and ploughed through ploughed fields till each was turned into a figure too outrageous to be mistaken for a tramp . Those green hills of Surrey saw the final collapse and tragedy of the admirable light grey suit in which Syme had set out from Saffron Park .
chesterton#"His silk hat was broken over his nose by a swinging bough , his coat - tails were torn to the shoulder by arresting thorns , the clay of England was splashed up to his collar ; but he still carried his yellow beard forward with a silent and furious determination , and his eyes were still fixed on that floating ball of gas , which in the full flush of sunset seemed coloured like a sunset cloud . "" After all ,"" he said , "" it is very beautiful !"" "" It is singularly and strangely beautiful !"" said the Professor . "" I wish the beastly gas - bag would burst !"" "" No ,"" said Dr . Bull , "" I hope it won ' t ."
chesterton#"It might hurt the old boy ."" "" Hurt him !"" said the vindictive Professor , "" hurt him ! Not as much as I ' d hurt him if I could get up with him . Little Snowdrop !"" "" I don ' t want him hurt , somehow ,"" said Dr . Bull ."
chesterton#""" What !"" cried the Secretary bitterly . "" Do you believe all that tale about his being our man in the dark room ? Sunday would say he was anybody ."" "" I don ' t know whether I believe it or not ,"" said Dr . Bull . "" But it isn ' t that that I mean ."
chesterton#"I can ' t wish old Sunday ' s balloon to burst because --"" "" Well ,"" said Syme impatiently , "" because ?"" "" Well , because he ' s so jolly like a balloon himself ,"" said Dr . Bull desperately . "" I don ' t understand a word of all that idea of his being the same man who gave us all our blue cards . It seems to make everything nonsense . But I don ' t care who knows it , I always had a sympathy for old Sunday himself , wicked as he was ."
chesterton#"Just as if he was a great bouncing baby . How can I explain what my queer sympathy was ? It didn ' t prevent my fighting him like hell ! Shall I make it clear if I say that I liked him because he was so fat ?"" "" You will not ,"" said the Secretary . "" I ' ve got it now ,"" cried Bull , "" it was because he was so fat and so light ."
chesterton#"Just like a balloon . We always think of fat people as heavy , but he could have danced against a sylph . I see now what I mean . Moderate strength is shown in violence , supreme strength is shown in levity . It was like the old speculations -- what would happen if an elephant could leap up in the sky like a grasshopper ?"" "" Our elephant ,"" said Syme , looking upwards , "" has leapt into the sky like a grasshopper ."""
chesterton#""" And somehow ,"" concluded Bull , "" that ' s why I can ' t help liking old Sunday . No , it ' s not an admiration of force , or any silly thing like that . There is a kind of gaiety in the thing , as if he were bursting with some good news . Haven ' t you sometimes felt it on a spring day ? You know Nature plays tricks , but somehow that day proves they are good - natured tricks . I never read the Bible myself , but that part they laugh at is literal truth , ' Why leap ye , ye high hills ?'"
chesterton#The hills do leap -- at least , they try to . . . . Why do I like Sunday ? .
chesterton#. . how can I tell you ? . . .
chesterton#"because he ' s such a Bounder ."" There was a long silence , and then the Secretary said in a curious , strained voice -- "" You do not know Sunday at all . Perhaps it is because you are better than I , and do not know hell . I was a fierce fellow , and a trifle morbid from the first . The man who sits in darkness , and who chose us all , chose me because I had all the crazy look of a conspirator -- because my smile went crooked , and my eyes were gloomy , even when I smiled ."
chesterton#But there must have been something in me that answered to the nerves in all these anarchic men . For when I first saw Sunday he expressed to me , not your airy vitality , but something both gross and sad in the Nature of Things . I found him smoking in a twilight room , a room with brown blind down , infinitely more depressing than the genial darkness in which our master lives . He sat there on a bench , a huge heap of a man , dark and out of shape . He listened to all my words without speaking or even stirring . I poured out my most passionate appeals , and asked my most eloquent questions .
chesterton#Then , after a long silence , the Thing began to shake , and I thought it was shaken by some secret malady . It shook like a loathsome and living jelly . It reminded me of everything I had ever read about the base bodies that are the origin of life -- the deep sea lumps and protoplasm . It seemed like the final form of matter , the most shapeless and the most shameful . I could only tell myself , from its shudderings , that it was something at least that such a monster could be miserable . And then it broke upon me that the bestial mountain was shaking with a lonely laughter , and the laughter was at me .
chesterton#"Do you ask me to forgive him that ? It is no small thing to be laughed at by something at once lower and stronger than oneself ."" "" Surely you fellows are exaggerating wildly ,"" cut in the clear voice of Inspector Ratcliffe . "" President Sunday is a terrible fellow for one ' s intellect , but he is not such a Barnum ' s freak physically as you make out . He received me in an ordinary office , in a grey check coat , in broad daylight . He talked to me in an ordinary way ."
chesterton#But I ' ll tell you what is a trifle creepy about Sunday . His room is neat , his clothes are neat , everything seems in order ; but he ' s absent - minded . Sometimes his great bright eyes go quite blind . For hours he forgets that you are there . Now absent - mindedness is just a bit too awful in a bad man . We think of a wicked man as vigilant .
chesterton#We can ' t think of a wicked man who is honestly and sincerely dreamy , because we daren ' t think of a wicked man alone with himself . An absentminded man means a good - natured man . It means a man who , if he happens to see you , will apologise . But how will you bear an absentminded man who , if he happens to see you , will kill you ? That is what tries the nerves , abstraction combined with cruelty . Men have felt it sometimes when they went through wild forests , and felt that the animals there were at once innocent and pitiless .
chesterton#"They might ignore or slay . How would you like to pass ten mortal hours in a parlour with an absent - minded tiger ?"" "" And what do you think of Sunday , Gogol ?"" asked Syme . "" I don ' t think of Sunday on principle ,"" said Gogol simply , "" any more than I stare at the sun at noonday ."" "" Well , that is a point of view ,"" said Syme thoughtfully ."
chesterton#""" What do you say , Professor ?"" The Professor was walking with bent head and trailing stick , and he did not answer at all . "" Wake up , Professor !"" said Syme genially . "" Tell us what you think of Sunday ."" The Professor spoke at last very slowly ."
chesterton#""" I think something ,"" he said , "" that I cannot say clearly . Or , rather , I think something that I cannot even think clearly . But it is something like this . My early life , as you know , was a bit too large and loose . Well , when I saw Sunday ' s face I thought it was too large -- everybody does , but I also thought it was too loose . The face was so big , that one couldn ' t focus it or make it a face at all ."
chesterton#"The eye was so far away from the nose , that it wasn ' t an eye . The mouth was so much by itself , that one had to think of it by itself . The whole thing is too hard to explain ."" He paused for a little , still trailing his stick , and then went on -- "" But put it this way . Walking up a road at night , I have seen a lamp and a lighted window and a cloud make together a most complete and unmistakable face ."
chesterton#If anyone in heaven has that face I shall know him again . Yet when I walked a little farther I found that there was no face , that the window was ten yards away , the lamp ten hundred yards , the cloud beyond the world . Well , Sunday ' s face escaped me ; it ran away to right and left , as such chance pictures run away . And so his face has made me , somehow , doubt whether there are any faces . I don ' t know whether your face , Bull , is a face or a combination in perspective . Perhaps one black disc of your beastly glasses is quite close and another fifty miles away .
chesterton#"Oh , the doubts of a materialist are not worth a dump . Sunday has taught me the last and the worst doubts , the doubts of a spiritualist . I am a Buddhist , I suppose ; and Buddhism is not a creed , it is a doubt . My poor dear Bull , I do not believe that you really have a face . I have not faith enough to believe in matter ."" Syme ' s eyes were still fixed upon the errant orb , which , reddened in the evening light , looked like some rosier and more innocent world ."
chesterton#""" Have you noticed an odd thing ,"" he said , "" about all your descriptions ? Each man of you finds Sunday quite different , yet each man of you can only find one thing to compare him to -- the universe itself . Bull finds him like the earth in spring , Gogol like the sun at noonday . The Secretary is reminded of the shapeless protoplasm , and the Inspector of the carelessness of virgin forests . The Professor says he is like a changing landscape . This is queer , but it is queerer still that I also have had my odd notion about the President , and I also find that I think of Sunday as I think of the whole world ."""
chesterton#""" Get on a little faster , Syme ,"" said Bull ; "" never mind the balloon ."" "" When I first saw Sunday ,"" said Syme slowly , "" I only saw his back ; and when I saw his back , I knew he was the worst man in the world . His neck and shoulders were brutal , like those of some apish god . His head had a stoop that was hardly human , like the stoop of an ox . In fact , I had at once the revolting fancy that this was not a man at all , but a beast dressed up in men ' s clothes ."" "" Get on ,"" said Dr . Bull ."
chesterton#""" And then the queer thing happened . I had seen his back from the street , as he sat in the balcony . Then I entered the hotel , and coming round the other side of him , saw his face in the sunlight . His face frightened me , as it did everyone ; but not because it was brutal , not because it was evil . On the contrary , it frightened me because it was so beautiful , because it was so good ."" "" Syme ,"" exclaimed the Secretary , "" are you ill ?"""
chesterton#""" It was like the face of some ancient archangel , judging justly after heroic wars . There was laughter in the eyes , and in the mouth honour and sorrow . There was the same white hair , the same great , grey - clad shoulders that I had seen from behind . But when I saw him from behind I was certain he was an animal , and when I saw him in front I knew he was a god ."" "" Pan ,"" said the Professor dreamily , "" was a god and an animal ."" "" Then , and again and always ,"" went on Syme like a man talking to himself , "" that has been for me the mystery of Sunday , and it is also the mystery of the world ."
chesterton#"When I see the horrible back , I am sure the noble face is but a mask . When I see the face but for an instant , I know the back is only a jest . Bad is so bad , that we cannot but think good an accident ; good is so good , that we feel certain that evil could be explained . But the whole came to a kind of crest yesterday when I raced Sunday for the cab , and was just behind him all the way ."" "" Had you time for thinking then ?"" asked Ratcliffe ."
chesterton#""" Time ,"" replied Syme , "" for one outrageous thought . I was suddenly possessed with the idea that the blind , blank back of his head really was his face -- an awful , eyeless face staring at me ! And I fancied that the figure running in front of me was really a figure running backwards , and dancing as he ran ."" "" Horrible !"" said Dr . Bull , and shuddered . "" Horrible is not the word ,"" said Syme ."
chesterton#""" It was exactly the worst instant of my life . And yet ten minutes afterwards , when he put his head out of the cab and made a grimace like a gargoyle , I knew that he was only like a father playing hide - and - seek with his children ."" "" It is a long game ,"" said the Secretary , and frowned at his broken boots . "" Listen to me ,"" cried Syme with extraordinary emphasis . "" Shall I tell you the secret of the whole world ? It is that we have only known the back of the world ."
chesterton#"We see everything from behind , and it looks brutal . That is not a tree , but the back of a tree . That is not a cloud , but the back of a cloud . Cannot you see that everything is stooping and hiding a face ? If we could only get round in front --"" "" Look !"""
chesterton#"cried out Bull clamorously , "" the balloon is coming down !"" There was no need to cry out to Syme , who had never taken his eyes off it . He saw the great luminous globe suddenly stagger in the sky , right itself , and then sink slowly behind the trees like a setting sun . The man called Gogol , who had hardly spoken through all their weary travels , suddenly threw up his hands like a lost spirit . "" He is dead !"" he cried ."
chesterton#""" And now I know he was my friend -- my friend in the dark !"" "" Dead !"" snorted the Secretary . "" You will not find him dead easily . If he has been tipped out of the car , we shall find him rolling as a colt rolls in a field , kicking his legs for fun ."" "" Clashing his hoofs ,"" said the Professor ."
chesterton#""" The colts do , and so did Pan ."" "" Pan again !"" said Dr . Bull irritably . "" You seem to think Pan is everything ."" "" So he is ,"" said the Professor , "" in Greek . He means everything ."""
chesterton#""" Don ' t forget ,"" said the Secretary , looking down , "" that he also means Panic ."" Syme had stood without hearing any of the exclamations . "" It fell over there ,"" he said shortly . "" Let us follow it !"" Then he added with an indescribable gesture -- "" Oh , if he has cheated us all by getting killed !"
chesterton#"It would be like one of his larks ."" He strode off towards the distant trees with a new energy , his rags and ribbons fluttering in the wind . The others followed him in a more footsore and dubious manner . And almost at the same moment all six men realised that they were not alone in the little field . Across the square of turf a tall man was advancing towards them , leaning on a strange long staff like a sceptre . He was clad in a fine but old - fashioned suit with knee - breeches ; its colour was that shade between blue , violet and grey which can be seen in certain shadows of the woodland ."
chesterton#"His hair was whitish grey , and at the first glance , taken along with his knee - breeches , looked as if it was powdered . His advance was very quiet ; but for the silver frost upon his head , he might have been one to the shadows of the wood . "" Gentlemen ,"" he said , "" my master has a carriage waiting for you in the road just by ."" "" Who is your master ?"" asked Syme , standing quite still . "" I was told you knew his name ,"" said the man respectfully ."
chesterton#"There was a silence , and then the Secretary said -- "" Where is this carriage ?"" "" It has been waiting only a few moments ,"" said the stranger . "" My master has only just come home ."" Syme looked left and right upon the patch of green field in which he found himself . The hedges were ordinary hedges , the trees seemed ordinary trees ; yet he felt like a man entrapped in fairyland ."
chesterton#"He looked the mysterious ambassador up and down , but he could discover nothing except that the man ' s coat was the exact colour of the purple shadows , and that the man ' s face was the exact colour of the red and brown and golden sky . "" Show us the place ,"" Syme said briefly , and without a word the man in the violet coat turned his back and walked towards a gap in the hedge , which let in suddenly the light of a white road . As the six wanderers broke out upon this thoroughfare , they saw the white road blocked by what looked like a long row of carriages , such a row of carriages as might close the approach to some house in Park Lane . Along the side of these carriages stood a rank of splendid servants , all dressed in the grey - blue uniform , and all having a certain quality of stateliness and freedom which would not commonly belong to the servants of a gentleman , but rather to the officials and ambassadors of a great king . There were no less than six carriages waiting , one for each of the tattered and miserable band . All the attendants ( as if in court - dress ) wore swords , and as each man crawled into his carriage they drew them , and saluted with a sudden blaze of steel ."
chesterton#""" What can it all mean ?"" asked Bull of Syme as they separated . "" Is this another joke of Sunday ' s ?"" "" I don ' t know ,"" said Syme as he sank wearily back in the cushions of his carriage ; "" but if it is , it ' s one of the jokes you talk about . It ' s a good - natured one ."" The six adventurers had passed through many adventures , but not one had carried them so utterly off their feet as this last adventure of comfort ."
chesterton#They had all become inured to things going roughly ; but things suddenly going smoothly swamped them . They could not even feebly imagine what the carriages were ; it was enough for them to know that they were carriages , and carriages with cushions . They could not conceive who the old man was who had led them ; but it was quite enough that he had certainly led them to the carriages . Syme drove through a drifting darkness of trees in utter abandonment . It was typical of him that while he had carried his bearded chin forward fiercely so long as anything could be done , when the whole business was taken out of his hands he fell back on the cushions in a frank collapse . Very gradually and very vaguely he realised into what rich roads the carriage was carrying him .
chesterton#He saw that they passed the stone gates of what might have been a park , that they began gradually to climb a hill which , while wooded on both sides , was somewhat more orderly than a forest . Then there began to grow upon him , as upon a man slowly waking from a healthy sleep , a pleasure in everything . He felt that the hedges were what hedges should be , living walls ; that a hedge is like a human army , disciplined , but all the more alive . He saw high elms behind the hedges , and vaguely thought how happy boys would be climbing there . Then his carriage took a turn of the path , and he saw suddenly and quietly , like a long , low , sunset cloud , a long , low house , mellow in the mild light of sunset . All the six friends compared notes afterwards and quarrelled ; but they all agreed that in some unaccountable way the place reminded them of their boyhood .
chesterton#"It was either this elm - top or that crooked path , it was either this scrap of orchard or that shape of a window ; but each man of them declared that he could remember this place before he could remember his mother . When the carriages eventually rolled up to a large , low , cavernous gateway , another man in the same uniform , but wearing a silver star on the grey breast of his coat , came out to meet them . This impressive person said to the bewildered Syme -- "" Refreshments are provided for you in your room ."" Syme , under the influence of the same mesmeric sleep of amazement , went up the large oaken stairs after the respectful attendant . He entered a splendid suite of apartments that seemed to be designed specially for him ."
chesterton#"He walked up to a long mirror with the ordinary instinct of his class , to pull his tie straight or to smooth his hair ; and there he saw the frightful figure that he was -- blood running down his face from where the bough had struck him , his hair standing out like yellow rags of rank grass , his clothes torn into long , wavering tatters . At once the whole enigma sprang up , simply as the question of how he had got there , and how he was to get out again . Exactly at the same moment a man in blue , who had been appointed as his valet , said very solemnly -- "" I have put out your clothes , sir ."" "" Clothes !"" said Syme sardonically ."
chesterton#""" I have no clothes except these ,"" and he lifted two long strips of his frock - coat in fascinating festoons , and made a movement as if to twirl like a ballet girl . "" My master asks me to say ,"" said the attendant , that there is a fancy dress ball tonight , and that he desires you to put on the costume that I have laid out . Meanwhile , sir , there is a bottle of Burgundy and some cold pheasant , which he hopes you will not refuse , as it is some hours before supper ."" "" Cold pheasant is a good thing ,"" said Syme reflectively , "" and Burgundy is a spanking good thing . But really I do not want either of them so much as I want to know what the devil all this means , and what sort of costume you have got laid out for me . Where is it ?"""
chesterton#"The servant lifted off a kind of ottoman a long peacock - blue drapery , rather of the nature of a domino , on the front of which was emblazoned a large golden sun , and which was splashed here and there with flaming stars and crescents . "" You ' re to be dressed as Thursday , sir ,"" said the valet somewhat affably . "" Dressed as Thursday !"" said Syme in meditation . "" It doesn ' t sound a warm costume ."" "" Oh , yes , sir ,"" said the other eagerly , "" the Thursday costume is quite warm , sir ."
chesterton#"It fastens up to the chin ."" "" Well , I don ' t understand anything ,"" said Syme , sighing . "" I have been used so long to uncomfortable adventures that comfortable adventures knock me out . Still , I may be allowed to ask why I should be particularly like Thursday in a green frock spotted all over with the sun and moon . Those orbs , I think , shine on other days . I once saw the moon on Tuesday , I remember ."""
chesterton#""" Beg pardon , sir ,"" said the valet , "" Bible also provided for you ,"" and with a respectful and rigid finger he pointed out a passage in the first chapter of Genesis . Syme read it wondering . It was that in which the fourth day of the week is associated with the creation of the sun and moon . Here , however , they reckoned from a Christian Sunday . "" This is getting wilder and wilder ,"" said Syme , as he sat down in a chair . "" Who are these people who provide cold pheasant and Burgundy , and green clothes and Bibles ?"
chesterton#"Do they provide everything ?"" "" Yes , sir , everything ,"" said the attendant gravely . "" Shall I help you on with your costume ?"" "" Oh , hitch the bally thing on !"" said Syme impatiently . But though he affected to despise the mummery , he felt a curious freedom and naturalness in his movements as the blue and gold garment fell about him ; and when he found that he had to wear a sword , it stirred a boyish dream ."
chesterton#As he passed out of the room he flung the folds across his shoulder with a gesture , his sword stood out at an angle , and he had all the swagger of a troubadour . For these disguises did not disguise , but reveal . CHAPTER XV THE ACCUSER AS Syme strode along the corridor he saw the Secretary standing at the top of a great flight of stairs . The man had never looked so noble .
chesterton#He was draped in a long robe of starless black , down the centre of which fell a band or broad stripe of pure white , like a single shaft of light . The whole looked like some very severe ecclesiastical vestment . There was no need for Syme to search his memory or the Bible in order to remember that the first day of creation marked the mere creation of light out of darkness . The vestment itself would alone have suggested the symbol ; and Syme felt also how perfectly this pattern of pure white and black expressed the soul of the pale and austere Secretary , with his inhuman veracity and his cold frenzy , which made him so easily make war on the anarchists , and yet so easily pass for one of them . Syme was scarcely surprised to notice that , amid all the ease and hospitality of their new surroundings , this man ' s eyes were still stern . No smell of ale or orchards could make the Secretary cease to ask a reasonable question .
chesterton#If Syme had been able to see himself , he would have realised that he , too , seemed to be for the first time himself and no one else . For if the Secretary stood for that philosopher who loves the original and formless light , Syme was a type of the poet who seeks always to make the light in special shapes , to split it up into sun and star . The philosopher may sometimes love the infinite ; the poet always loves the finite . For him the great moment is not the creation of light , but the creation of the sun and moon . As they descended the broad stairs together they overtook Ratcliffe , who was clad in spring green like a huntsman , and the pattern upon whose garment was a green tangle of trees . For he stood for that third day on which the earth and green things were made , and his square , sensible face , with its not unfriendly cynicism , seemed appropriate enough to it .
chesterton#They were led out of another broad and low gateway into a very large old English garden , full of torches and bonfires , by the broken light of which a vast carnival of people were dancing in motley dress . Syme seemed to see every shape in Nature imitated in some crazy costume . There was a man dressed as a windmill with enormous sails , a man dressed as an elephant , a man dressed as a balloon ; the two last , together , seemed to keep the thread of their farcical adventures . Syme even saw , with a queer thrill , one dancer dressed like an enormous hornbill , with a beak twice as big as himself -- the queer bird which had fixed itself on his fancy like a living question while he was rushing down the long road at the Zoological Gardens . There were a thousand other such objects , however . There was a dancing lamp - post , a dancing apple tree , a dancing ship .
chesterton#One would have thought that the untamable tune of some mad musician had set all the common objects of field and street dancing an eternal jig . And long afterwards , when Syme was middle - aged and at rest , he could never see one of those particular objects -- a lamppost , or an apple tree , or a windmill -- without thinking that it was a strayed reveller from that revel of masquerade . On one side of this lawn , alive with dancers , was a sort of green bank , like the terrace in such old - fashioned gardens . Along this , in a kind of crescent , stood seven great chairs , the thrones of the seven days . Gogol and Dr . Bull were already in their seats ; the Professor was just mounting to his . Gogol , or Tuesday , had his simplicity well symbolised by a dress designed upon the division of the waters , a dress that separated upon his forehead and fell to his feet , grey and silver , like a sheet of rain .
chesterton#The Professor , whose day was that on which the birds and fishes -- the ruder forms of life -- were created , had a dress of dim purple , over which sprawled goggle - eyed fishes and outrageous tropical birds , the union in him of unfathomable fancy and of doubt . Dr . Bull , the last day of Creation , wore a coat covered with heraldic animals in red and gold , and on his crest a man rampant . He lay back in his chair with a broad smile , the picture of an optimist in his element . One by one the wanderers ascended the bank and sat in their strange seats . As each of them sat down a roar of enthusiasm rose from the carnival , such as that with which crowds receive kings . Cups were clashed and torches shaken , and feathered hats flung in the air .
chesterton#"The men for whom these thrones were reserved were men crowned with some extraordinary laurels . But the central chair was empty . Syme was on the left hand of it and the Secretary on the right . The Secretary looked across the empty throne at Syme , and said , compressing his lips -- "" We do not know yet that he is not dead in a field ."" Almost as Syme heard the words , he saw on the sea of human faces in front of him a frightful and beautiful alteration , as if heaven had opened behind his head ."
chesterton#But Sunday had only passed silently along the front like a shadow , and had sat in the central seat . He was draped plainly , in a pure and terrible white , and his hair was like a silver flame on his forehead . For a long time -- it seemed for hours -- that huge masquerade of mankind swayed and stamped in front of them to marching and exultant music . Every couple dancing seemed a separate romance ; it might be a fairy dancing with a pillar - box , or a peasant girl dancing with the moon ; but in each case it was , somehow , as absurd as Alice in Wonderland , yet as grave and kind as a love story . At last , however , the thick crowd began to thin itself . Couples strolled away into the garden - walks , or began to drift towards that end of the building where stood smoking , in huge pots like fish - kettles , some hot and scented mixtures of old ale or wine .
chesterton#Above all these , upon a sort of black framework on the roof of the house , roared in its iron basket a gigantic bonfire , which lit up the land for miles . It flung the homely effect of firelight over the face of vast forests of grey or brown , and it seemed to fill with warmth even the emptiness of upper night . Yet this also , after a time , was allowed to grow fainter ; the dim groups gathered more and more round the great cauldrons , or passed , laughing and clattering , into the inner passages of that ancient house . Soon there were only some ten loiterers in the garden ; soon only four . Finally the last stray merry - maker ran into the house whooping to his companions . The fire faded , and the slow , strong stars came out .
chesterton#"And the seven strange men were left alone , like seven stone statues on their chairs of stone . Not one of them had spoken a word . They seemed in no haste to do so , but heard in silence the hum of insects and the distant song of one bird . Then Sunday spoke , but so dreamily that he might have been continuing a conversation rather than beginning one . "" We will eat and drink later ,"" he said . "" Let us remain together a little , we who have loved each other so sadly , and have fought so long ."
chesterton#"I seem to remember only centuries of heroic war , in which you were always heroes -- epic on epic , iliad on iliad , and you always brothers in arms . Whether it was but recently ( for time is nothing ), or at the beginning of the world , I sent you out to war . I sat in the darkness , where there is not any created thing , and to you I was only a voice commanding valour and an unnatural virtue . You heard the voice in the dark , and you never heard it again . The sun in heaven denied it , the earth and sky denied it , all human wisdom denied it . And when I met you in the daylight I denied it myself ."""
chesterton#"Syme stirred sharply in his seat , but otherwise there was silence , and the incomprehensible went on . "" But you were men . You did not forget your secret honour , though the whole cosmos turned an engine of torture to tear it out of you . I knew how near you were to hell . I know how you , Thursday , crossed swords with King Satan , and how you , Wednesday , named me in the hour without hope ."" There was complete silence in the starlit garden , and then the black - browed Secretary , implacable , turned in his chair towards Sunday , and said in a harsh voice --"
chesterton#""" Who and what are you ?"" "" I am the Sabbath ,"" said the other without moving . "" I am the peace of God ."" The Secretary started up , and stood crushing his costly robe in his hand . "" I know what you mean ,"" he cried , "" and it is exactly that that I cannot forgive you . I know you are contentment , optimism , what do they call the thing , an ultimate reconciliation ."
chesterton#"Well , I am not reconciled . If you were the man in the dark room , why were you also Sunday , an offense to the sunlight ? If you were from the first our father and our friend , why were you also our greatest enemy ? We wept , we fled in terror ; the iron entered into our souls -- and you are the peace of God ! Oh , I can forgive God His anger , though it destroyed nations ; but I cannot forgive Him His peace ."" Sunday answered not a word , but very slowly he turned his face of stone upon Syme as if asking a question ."
chesterton#""" No ,"" said Syme , "" I do not feel fierce like that . I am grateful to you , not only for wine and hospitality here , but for many a fine scamper and free fight . But I should like to know . My soul and heart are as happy and quiet here as this old garden , but my reason is still crying out . I should like to know ."" Sunday looked at Ratcliffe , whose clear voice said --"
chesterton#""" It seems so silly that you should have been on both sides and fought yourself ."" Bull said -- "" l understand nothing , but I am happy . In fact , I am going to sleep ."" "" I am not happy ,"" said the Professor with his head in his hands , "" because I do not understand . You let me stray a little too near to hell ."""
chesterton#"And then Gogol said , with the absolute simplicity of a child -- "" I wish I knew why I was hurt so much ."" Still Sunday said nothing , but only sat with his mighty chin upon his hand , and gazed at the distance . Then at last he said -- "" I have heard your complaints in order . And here , I think , comes another to complain , and we will hear him also ."""
chesterton#"The falling fire in the great cresset threw a last long gleam , like a bar of burning gold , across the dim grass . Against this fiery band was outlined in utter black the advancing legs of a black - clad figure . He seemed to have a fine close suit with knee - breeches such as that which was worn by the servants of the house , only that it was not blue , but of this absolute sable . He had , like the servants , a kind of word by his side . It was only when he had come quite close to the crescent of the seven and flung up his face to look at them , that Syme saw , with thunder - struck clearness , that the face was the broad , almost ape - like face of his old friend Gregory , with its rank red hair and its insulting smile . "" Gregory !"""
chesterton#"gasped Syme , half - rising from his seat . "" Why , this is the real anarchist !"" "" Yes ,"" said Gregory , with a great and dangerous restraint , "" I am the real anarchist ."" ""' Now there was a day ,'"" murmured Bull , who seemed really to have fallen asleep , ""' when the sons of God came to present themselves before the Lord , and Satan came also among them .'"" "" You are right ,"" said Gregory , and gazed all round . "" I am a destroyer ."
chesterton#"I would destroy the world if I could ."" A sense of a pathos far under the earth stirred up in Syme , and he spoke brokenly and without sequence . "" Oh , most unhappy man ,"" he cried , "" try to be happy ! You have red hair like your sister ."" "" My red hair , like red flames , shall burn up the world ,"" said Gregory . "" I thought I hated everything more than common men can hate anything ; but I find that I do not hate everything so much as I hate you ! """
chesterton#""" I never hated you ,"" said Syme very sadly . Then out of this unintelligible creature the last thunders broke . "" You !"" he cried . "" You never hated because you never lived . I know what you are all of you , from first to last -- you are the people in power !"
chesterton#You are the police -- the great fat , smiling men in blue and buttons ! You are the Law , and you have never been broken . But is there a free soul alive that does not long to break you , only because you have never been broken ? We in revolt talk all kind of nonsense doubtless about this crime or that crime of the Government . It is all folly ! The only crime of the Government is that it governs .
chesterton#The unpardonable sin of the supreme power is that it is supreme . I do not curse you for being cruel . I do not curse you ( though I might ) for being kind . I curse you for being safe ! You sit in your chairs of stone , and have never come down from them . You are the seven angels of heaven , and you have had no troubles .
chesterton#"Oh , I could forgive you everything , you that rule all mankind , if I could feel for once that you had suffered for one hour a real agony such as I --"" Syme sprang to his feet , shaking from head to foot . "" I see everything ,"" he cried , "" everything that there is . Why does each thing on the earth war against each other thing ? Why does each small thing in the world have to fight against the world itself ? Why does a fly have to fight the whole universe ?"
chesterton#Why does a dandelion have to fight the whole universe ? For the same reason that I had to be alone in the dreadful Council of the Days . So that each thing that obeys law may have the glory and isolation of the anarchist . So that each man fighting for order may be as brave and good a man as the dynamiter . So that the real lie of Satan may be flung back in the face of this blasphemer , so that by tears and torture we may earn the right to say to this man , ' You lie !' No agonies can be too great to buy the right to say to this accuser , ' We also have suffered .'
chesterton#""" It is not true that we have never been broken . We have been broken upon the wheel . It is not true that we have never descended from these thrones . We have descended into hell . We were complaining of unforgettable miseries even at the very moment when this man entered insolently to accuse us of happiness . I repel the slander ; we have not been happy ."
chesterton#"I can answer for every one of the great guards of Law whom he has accused . At least --"" He had turned his eyes so as to see suddenly the great face of Sunday , which wore a strange smile . "" Have you ,"" he cried in a dreadful voice , "" have you ever suffered ?"" As he gazed , the great face grew to an awful size , grew larger than the colossal mask of Memnon , which had made him scream as a child . It grew larger and larger , filling the whole sky ; then everything went black ."
chesterton#"Only in the blackness before it entirely destroyed his brain he seemed to hear a distant voice saying a commonplace text that he had heard somewhere , "" Can ye drink of the cup that I drink of ?"" * * * When men in books awake from a vision , they commonly find themselves in some place in which they might have fallen asleep ; they yawn in a chair , or lift themselves with bruised limbs from a field . Syme ' s experience was something much more psychologically strange if there was indeed anything unreal , in the earthly sense , about the things he had gone through . For while he could always remember afterwards that he had swooned before the face of Sunday , he could not remember having ever come to at all . He could only remember that gradually and naturally he knew that he was and had been walking along a country lane with an easy and conversational companion ."
chesterton#That companion had been a part of his recent drama ; it was the red - haired poet Gregory . They were walking like old friends , and were in the middle of a conversation about some triviality . But Syme could only feel an unnatural buoyancy in his body and a crystal simplicity in his mind that seemed to be superior to everything that he said or did . He felt he was in possession of some impossible good news , which made every other thing a triviality , but an adorable triviality . Dawn was breaking over everything in colours at once clear and timid ; as if Nature made a first attempt at yellow and a first attempt at rose . A breeze blew so clean and sweet , that one could not think that it blew from the sky ; it blew rather through some hole in the sky .
chesterton#Syme felt a simple surprise when he saw rising all round him on both sides of the road the red , irregular buildings of Saffron Park . He had no idea that he had walked so near London . He walked by instinct along one white road , on which early birds hopped and sang , and found himself outside a fenced garden . There he saw the sister of Gregory , the girl with the gold - red hair , cutting lilac before breakfast , with the great unconscious gravity of a girl .

Come , I will giue you way for these your Letters , And do ' t the speedier , that you may direct me To him from whom you brought them .
shakespeare#Enter . Enter King and Laertes . King . Now must your conscience my acquittance seal , And you must put me in your heart for Friend , Sith you haue heard , and with a knowing eare , That he which hath your Noble Father slaine , Pursued my life Laer . It well appeares .
shakespeare#But tell me , Why you proceeded not against these feates , So crimefull , and so Capitall in Nature , As by your Safety , Wisedome , all things else , You mainly were stirr ' d vp ? King . O for two speciall Reasons , Which may to you ( perhaps ) seeme much vnsinnowed , And yet to me they are strong . The Queen his Mother , Liues almost by his lookes : and for my selfe , My Vertue or my Plague , be it either which , She ' s so coniunctiue to my life , and soule ; That as the Starre moues not but in his Sphere , I could not but by her . The other Motiue , Why to a publike count I might not go , Is the great loue the generall gender beare him , Who dipping all his Faults in their affection , Would like the Spring that turneth Wood to Stone , Conuert his Gyues to Graces . So that my Arrowes Too slightly timbred for so loud a Winde , Would haue reuerted to my Bow againe , And not where I had arm ' d them
shakespeare#Laer . And so haue I a Noble Father lost , A Sister driuen into desperate tearmes , Who was ( if praises may go backe againe ) Stood Challenger on mount of all the Age For her perfections . But my reuenge will come King . Breake not your sleepes for that , You must not thinke That we are made of stuffe , so flat , and dull , That we can let our Beard be shooke with danger , And thinke it pastime . You shortly shall heare more , I lou ' d your Father , and we loue our Selfe , And that I hope will teach you to imagine - Enter a Messenger .
shakespeare#How now ? What Newes ? Mes . Letters my Lord from Hamlet , This to your Maiesty : this to the Queene King . From Hamlet ?
shakespeare#Who brought them ? Mes . Saylors my Lord they say , I saw them not : They were giuen me by Claudio , he receiu ' d them King . Laertes you shall heare them : Leaue vs . Exit Messenger
shakespeare#High and Mighty , you shall know I am set naked on your Kingdome . To morrow shall I begge leaue to see your Kingly Eyes . When I shall ( first asking your Pardon thereunto ) recount th ' Occasions of my sodaine , and more strange returne . Hamlet . What should this meane ? Are all the rest come backe ?
shakespeare#Or is it some abuse ? Or no such thing ? Laer . Know you the hand ? Kin . ' Tis Hamlets Character , naked and in a Postscript here he sayes alone : Can you aduise me ?
shakespeare#Laer . I ' m lost in it my Lord ; but let him come , It warmes the very sicknesse in my heart , That I shall liue and tell him to his teeth ; Thus diddest thou Kin . If it be so Laertes , as how should it be so : How otherwise will you be rul ' d by me ? Laer . If so you ' l not o ' rerule me to a peace
shakespeare#Kin . To thine owne peace : if he be now return ' d , As checking at his Voyage , and that he meanes No more to vndertake it ; I will worke him To an exployt now ripe in my Deuice , Vnder the which he shall not choose but fall ; And for his death no winde of blame shall breath , But euen his Mother shall vncharge the practice , And call it accident : Some two Monthes hence Here was a Gentleman of Normandy , I ' ue seene my selfe , and seru ' d against the French , And they ran well on Horsebacke ; but this Gallant Had witchcraft in ' t ; he grew into his Seat , And to such wondrous doing brought his Horse , As had he beene encorps ' t and demy - Natur ' d With the braue Beast , so farre he past my thought , That I in forgery of shapes and trickes , Come short of what he did Laer . A Norman was ' t ? Kin . A Norman
shakespeare#Laer . Vpon my life Lamound Kin . The very same Laer . I know him well , he is the Brooch indeed , And Iemme of all our Nation
shakespeare#Kin . Hee mad confession of you , And gaue you such a Masterly report , For Art and exercise in your defence ; And for your Rapier most especiall , That he cryed out , t ' would be a sight indeed , If one could match you Sir . This report of his Did Hamlet so envenom with his Enuy , That he could nothing doe but wish and begge , Your sodaine comming ore to play with him ; Now out of this Laer . Why out of this , my Lord ? Kin .
shakespeare#Laertes was your Father deare to you ? Or are you like the painting of a sorrow , A face without a heart ? Laer . Why aske you this ? Kin . Not that I thinke you did not loue your Father , But that I know Loue is begun by Time : And that I see in passages of proofe , Time qualifies the sparke and fire of it : Hamlet comes backe : what would you vndertake , To show your selfe your Fathers sonne indeed , More then in words ?
shakespeare#Laer . To cut his throat i ' th ' Church Kin . No place indeed should murder Sancturize ; Reuenge should haue no bounds : but good Laertes Will you doe this , keepe close within your Chamber , Hamlet return ' d , shall know you are come home : Wee ' l put on those shall praise your excellence , And set a double varnish on the fame The Frenchman gaue you , bring you in fine together , And wager on your heads , he being remisse , Most generous , and free from all contriuing , Will not peruse the Foiles ? So that with ease , Or with a little shuffling , you may choose A Sword vnbaited , and in a passe of practice , Requit him for your Father Laer .
shakespeare#I will doo ' t . And for that purpose Ile annoint my Sword : I bought an Vnction of a Mountebanke So mortall , I but dipt a knife in it , Where it drawes blood , no Cataplasme so rare , Collected from all Simples that haue Vertue Vnder the Moone , can saue the thing from death , That is but scratcht withall : Ile touch my point , With this contagion , that if I gall him slightly , It may be death Kin . Let ' s further thinke of this , Weigh what conuenience both of time and meanes May fit vs to our shape , if this should faile ; And that our drift looke through our bad performance , ' Twere better not assaid ; therefore this Proiect Should haue a backe or second , that might hold , If this should blast in proofe : Soft , let me see Wee ' l make a solemne wager on your commings , I ha ' t : when in your motion you are hot and dry , As make your bowts more violent to the end , And that he cals for drinke ; Ile haue prepar ' d him A Challice for the nonce ; whereon but sipping , If he by chance escape your venom ' d stuck , Our purpose may hold there ; how sweet Queene . Enter Queene . Queen .
shakespeare#One woe doth tread vpon anothers heele , So fast they ' l follow : your Sister ' s drown ' d Laertes Laer . Drown ' d ! O where ? Queen . There is a Willow growes aslant a Brooke , That shewes his hore leaues in the glassie streame : There with fantasticke Garlands did she come , Of Crow - flowers , Nettles , Daysies , and long Purples , That liberall Shepheards giue a grosser name ; But our cold Maids doe Dead Mens Fingers call them : There on the pendant boughes , her Coronet weeds Clambring to hang ; an enuious sliuer broke , When downe the weedy Trophies , and her selfe , Fell in the weeping Brooke , her cloathes spred wide , And Mermaid - like , a while they bore her vp , Which time she chaunted snatches of old tunes , As one incapable of her owne distresse , Or like a creature Natiue , and indued Vnto that Element : but long it could not be , Till that her garments , heauy with her drinke , Pul ' d the poore wretch from her melodious buy , To muddy death
shakespeare#Laer . Alas then , is she drown ' d ? Queen . Drown ' d , drown ' d Laer . Too much of water hast thou poore Ophelia , And therefore I forbid my teares : but yet It is our tricke , Nature her custome holds , Let shame say what it will ; when these are gone The woman will be out : Adue my Lord , I haue a speech of fire , that faine would blaze , But that this folly doubts it .
shakespeare#Enter . Kin . Let ' s follow , Gertrude : How much I had to doe to calme his rage ? Now feare I this will giue it start againe ; Therefore let ' s follow . Exeunt . Enter two Clownes .
shakespeare#Clown . Is she to bee buried in Christian buriall , that wilfully seekes her owne saluation ? Other . I tell thee she is , and therefore make her Graue straight , the Crowner hath sate on her , and finds it Christian buriall Clo . How can that be , vnlesse she drowned her selfe in her owne defence ?
shakespeare#Other . Why ' tis found so Clo . It must be Se offendendo , it cannot bee else : for heere lies the point ; If I drowne my selfe wittingly , it argues an Act : and an Act hath three branches . It is an Act to doe and to performe ; argall she drown ' d her selfe wittingly Other .
shakespeare#Nay but heare you Goodman Deluer Clown . Giue me leaue ; heere lies the water ; good : heere stands the man ; good : If the man goe to this water and drowne himselfe ; it is will he nill he , he goes ; marke you that ? But if the water come to him & drowne him ; hee drownes not himselfe . Argall , hee that is not guilty of his owne death , shortens not his owne life Other .
shakespeare#But is this law ? Clo . I marry is ' t , Crowners Quest Law Other . Will you ha the truth on ' t : if this had not beene a Gentlewoman , shee should haue beene buried out of Christian Buriall Clo .
shakespeare#Why there thou say ' st . And the more pitty that great folke should haue countenance in this world to drowne or hang themselues , more then their euen Christian . Come , my Spade ; there is no ancient Gentlemen , but Gardiners , Ditchers and Graue - makers ; they hold vp Adams Profession Other . Was he a Gentleman ? Clo .
shakespeare#He was the first that euer bore Armes Other . Why he had none Clo . What , ar ' t a Heathen ? how doth thou vnderstand the Scripture ?
shakespeare#the Scripture sayes Adam dig ' d ; could hee digge without Armes ? Ile put another question to thee ; if thou answerest me not to the purpose , confesse thy selfe - Other . Go too Clo . What is he that builds stronger then either the Mason , the Shipwright , or the Carpenter ? Other .
shakespeare#The Gallowes maker ; for that Frame outliues a thousand Tenants Clo . I like thy wit well in good faith , the Gallowes does well ; but how does it well ? it does well to those that doe ill : now , thou dost ill to say the Gallowes is built stronger then the Church : Argall , the Gallowes may doe well to thee . Too ' t againe , Come Other .
shakespeare#Who builds stronger then a Mason , a Shipwright , or a Carpenter ? Clo . I , tell me that , and vnyoake Other . Marry , now I can tell Clo .
shakespeare#Too ' t Other . Masse , I cannot tell . Enter Hamlet and Horatio a farre off . Clo . Cudgell thy braines no more about it ; for your dull Asse will not mend his pace with beating ; and when you are ask ' t this question next , say a Graue - maker : the Houses that he makes , lasts till Doomesday : go , get thee to Yaughan , fetch me a stoupe of Liquor .
shakespeare#Sings . In youth when I did loue , did loue , me thought it was very sweete : To contract O the time for a my behoue , O me thought there was nothing meete Ham . Ha ' s this fellow no feeling of his businesse , that he sings at Graue - making ? Hor . Custome hath made it in him a property of easinesse
shakespeare#Ham . ' Tis ee ' n so ; the hand of little Imployment hath the daintier sense Clowne sings . But Age with his stealing steps hath caught me in his clutch : And hath shipped me intill the Land , as if I had neuer beene such Ham . That Scull had a tongue in it , and could sing once : how the knaue iowles it to th ' grownd , as if it were Caines Iaw - bone , that did the first murther : It might be the Pate of a Polititian which this Asse o ' re Offices : one that could circumuent God , might it not ?
shakespeare#Hor . It might , my Lord Ham . Or of a Courtier , which could say , Good Morrow sweet Lord : how dost thou , good Lord ? this might be my Lord such a one , that prais ' d my Lord such a ones Horse , when he meant to begge it ; might it not ? Hor .
shakespeare#I , my Lord Ham . Why ee ' n so : and now my Lady Wormes , Chaplesse , and knockt about the Mazard with a Sextons Spade ; heere ' s fine Reuolution , if wee had the tricke to see ' t . Did these bones cost no more the breeding , but to play at Loggets with ' em ? mine ake to thinke on ' t Clowne sings .
shakespeare#A Pickhaxe and a Spade , a Spade , for and a shrowding - Sheete : O a Pit of Clay for to be made , for such a Guest is meete Ham . There ' s another : why might not that bee the Scull of a Lawyer ? where be his Quiddits now ? his Quillets ? his Cases ?
shakespeare#his Tenures , and his Tricks ? why doe ' s he suffer this rude knaue now to knocke him about the Sconce with a dirty Shouell , and will not tell him of his Action of Battery ? hum . This fellow might be in ' s time a great buyer of Land , with his Statutes , his Recognizances , his Fines , his double Vouchers , his Recoueries : Is this the fine of his Fines , and the recouery of his Recoueries , to haue his fine Pate full of fine Dirt ? will his Vouchers vouch him no more of his Purchases , and double ones too , then the length and breadth of a paire of Indentures ? the very Conueyances of his Lands will hardly lye in this Boxe ; and must the Inheritor himselfe haue no more ?
shakespeare#ha ? Hor . Not a iot more , my Lord Ham . Is not Parchment made of Sheep - skinnes ? Hor .

shakespeare#Ham . I thinke it be thine indeed : for thou liest in ' t Clo . You lye out on ' t Sir , and therefore it is not yours : for my part , I doe not lye in ' t ; and yet it is mine Ham . Thou dost lye in ' t , to be in ' t and say ' tis thine : ' tis for the dead , not for the quicke , therefore thou lyest
shakespeare#Clo . ' Tis a quicke lye Sir , ' twill away againe from me to you Ham . What man dost thou digge it for ? Clo . For no man Sir
shakespeare#Ham . What woman then ? Clo . For none neither Ham . Who is to be buried in ' t ?
shakespeare#Clo . One that was a woman Sir ; but rest her Soule , shee ' s dead Ham . How absolute the knaue is ? wee must speake by the Carde , or equiuocation will vndoe vs : by the Lord Horatio , these three yeares I haue taken note of it , the Age is growne so picked , that the toe of the Pesant comes so neere the heeles of our Courtier , hee galls his Kibe . How long hast thou been a Graue - maker ?
shakespeare#Clo . Of all the dayes i ' th ' yeare , I came too ' t that day that our last King Hamlet o ' recame Fortinbras Ham . How long is that since ? Clo . Cannot you tell that ?
shakespeare#euery foole can tell that : It was the very day , that young Hamlet was borne , hee that was mad , and sent into England Ham . I marry , why was he sent into England ? Clo . Why , because he was mad ; hee shall recouer his wits there ; or if he do not , it ' s no great matter there Ham .
shakespeare#Why ? Clo . ' Twill not be seene in him , there the men are as mad as he Ham . How came he mad ? Clo .
shakespeare#Very strangely they say Ham . How strangely ? Clo . Faith e ' ene with loosing his wits Ham .
shakespeare#Vpon what ground ? Clo . Why heere in Denmarke : I haue bin sixeteene heere , man and Boy thirty yeares Ham . How long will a man lie i ' th ' earth ere he rot ? Clo .
shakespeare#Ifaith , if he be not rotten before he die ( as we haue many pocky Coarses now adaies , that will scarce hold the laying in ) he will last you some eight yeare , or nine yeare . A Tanner will last you nine yeare Ham . Why he , more then another ? Clo . Why sir , his hide is so tan ' d with his Trade , that he will keepe out water a great while .
shakespeare#And your water , is a sore Decayer of your horson dead body . Heres a Scull now : this Scul , has laine in the earth three & twenty years Ham . Whose was it ? Clo . A whoreson mad Fellowes it was ; Whose doe you thinke it was ?
shakespeare#Ham . Nay , I know not Clo . A pestilence on him for a mad Rogue , a pour ' d a Flaggon of Renish on my head once . This same Scull Sir , this same Scull sir , was Yoricks Scull , the Kings Iester Ham .
shakespeare#This ? Clo . E ' ene that Ham . Let me see . Alas poore Yorick , I knew him Horatio , a fellow of infinite Iest ; of most excellent fancy , he hath borne me on his backe a thousand times : And how abhorred my Imagination is , my gorge rises at it .
shakespeare#Heere hung those lipps , that I haue kist I know not how oft . Where be your Iibes now ? Your Gambals ? Your Songs ? Your flashes of Merriment that were wont to set the Table on a Rore ? No one now to mock your own Ieering ?
shakespeare#Quite chopfalne ? Now get you to my Ladies Chamber , and tell her , let her paint an inch thicke , to this fauour she must come . Make her laugh at that : prythee Horatio tell me one thing Hor . What ' s that my Lord ? Ham .
shakespeare#Dost thou thinke Alexander lookt o ' this fashion i ' th ' earth ? Hor . E ' ene so Ham . And smelt so ? Puh
shakespeare#Hor . E ' ene so , my Lord Ham . To what base vses we may returne Horatio . Why may not Imagination trace the Noble dust of Alexander , till he find it stopping a bunghole Hor .
shakespeare#' Twere to consider : to curiously to consider so Ham . No faith , not a iot . But to follow him thether with modestie enough , & likeliehood to lead it ; as thus . Alexander died : Alexander was buried : Alexander returneth into dust ; the dust is earth ; of earth we make Lome , and why of that Lome ( whereto he was conuerted ) might they not stopp a Beere - barrell ? Imperiall Caesar , dead and turn ' d to clay , Might stop a hole to keepe the winde away .
shakespeare#Oh , that that earth , which kept the world in awe , Should patch a Wall , t ' expell the winters flaw . But soft , but soft , aside ; heere comes the King . Enter King , Queene , Laertes , and a Coffin , with Lords attendant . The Queene , the Courtiers . Who is that they follow , And with such maimed rites ? This doth betoken , The Coarse they follow , did with disperate hand , Fore do it owne life ; ' twas some Estate .
shakespeare#Couch we a while , and mark Laer . What Cerimony else ? Ham . That is Laertes , a very Noble youth : Marke Laer .
shakespeare#What Cerimony else ? Priest . Her Obsequies haue bin as farre inlarg ' d . As we haue warrantie , her death was doubtfull , And but that great Command , o ' re - swaies the order , She should in ground vnsanctified haue lodg ' d , Till the last Trumpet . For charitable praier , Shardes , Flints , and Peebles , should be throwne on her : Yet heere she is allowed her Virgin Rites , Her Maiden strewments , and the bringing home Of Bell and Buriall Laer .
shakespeare#Must there no more be done ? Priest . No more be done : We should prophane the seruice of the dead , To sing sage Requiem , and such rest to her As to peace - parted Soules Laer . Lay her i ' th ' earth , And from her faire and vnpolluted flesh , May Violets spring . I tell thee ( churlish Priest ) A Ministring Angell shall my Sister be , When thou liest howling ?
shakespeare#Ham . What , the faire Ophelia ? Queene . Sweets , to the sweet farewell . I hop ' d thou should ' st haue bin my Hamlets wife : I thought thy Bride - bed to haue deckt ( sweet Maid ) And not t ' haue strew ' d thy Graue Laer .
shakespeare#Oh terrible woer , Fall ten times trebble , on that cursed head Whose wicked deed , thy most Ingenious sence Depriu ' d thee of . Hold off the earth a while , Till I haue caught her once more in mine armes : Leaps in the graue . Now pile your dust , vpon the quicke , and dead , Till of this flat a Mountaine you haue made , To o ' re top old Pelion , or the skyish head Of blew Olympus Ham . What is he , whose griefes Beares such an Emphasis ?
shakespeare#whose phrase of Sorrow Coniure the wandring Starres , and makes them stand Like wonder - wounded hearers ? This is I , Hamlet the Dane Laer . The deuill take thy soule Ham . Thou prai ' st not well , I prythee take thy fingers from my throat ; Sir though I am not Spleenatiue , and rash , Yet haue I something in me dangerous , Which let thy wisenesse feare .
shakespeare#Away thy hand King . Pluck them asunder Qu . Hamlet , Hamlet Gen . Good my Lord be quiet

shakespeare#Come show me what thou ' lt doe . Woo ' t weepe ? Woo ' t fight ? Woo ' t teare thy selfe ? Woo ' t drinke vp Esile , eate a Crocodile ? Ile doo ' t .
shakespeare#Dost thou come heere to whine ; To outface me with leaping in her Graue ? Be buried quicke with her , and so will I . And if thou prate of Mountaines ; let them throw Millions of Akers on vs ; till our ground Sindging his pate against the burning Zone , Make Ossa like a wart . Nay , and thou ' lt mouth , Ile rant as well as thou Kin . This is meere Madnesse : And thus awhile the fit will worke on him : Anon as patient as the female Doue , When that her Golden Cuplet are disclos ' d ; His silence will sit drooping
shakespeare#Ham . Heare you Sir : What is the reason that you vse me thus ? I lou ' d you euer ; but it is no matter : Let Hercules himselfe doe what he may , The Cat will Mew , and Dogge will haue his day . Enter . Kin . I pray you good Horatio wait vpon him , Strengthen your patience in our last nights speech , Wee ' l put the matter to the present push : Good Gertrude set some watch ouer your Sonne , This Graue shall haue a liuing Monument : An houre of quiet shortly shall we see ; Till then , in patience our proceeding be .
shakespeare#Exeunt . Enter Hamlet and Horatio Ham . So much for this Sir ; now let me see the other , You doe remember all the Circumstance Hor . Remember it my Lord ?
shakespeare#Ham . Sir , in my heart there was a kinde of fighting , That would not let me sleepe ; me thought I lay Worse then the mutines in the Bilboes , rashly , ( And praise be rashnesse for it ) let vs know , Our indiscretion sometimes serues vs well , When our deare plots do paule , and that should teach vs , There ' s a Diuinity that shapes our ends , Rough - hew them how we will Hor . That is most certaine Ham . Vp from my Cabin My sea - gowne scarft about me in the darke , Grop ' d I to finde out them ; had my desire , Finger ' d their Packet , and in fine , withdrew To mine owne roome againe , making so bold , ( My feares forgetting manners ) to vnseale Their grand Commission , where I found Horatio , Oh royall knauery : An exact command , Larded with many seuerall sorts of reason ; Importing Denmarks health , and Englands too , With hoo , such Bugges and Goblins in my life , That on the superuize no leasure bated , No not to stay the grinding of the Axe , My head should be struck off
shakespeare#Hor . Ist possible ? Ham . Here ' s the Commission , read it at more leysure : But wilt thou heare me how I did proceed ? Hor . I beseech you
shakespeare#Ham . Being thus benetted round with Villaines , Ere I could make a Prologue to my braines , They had begun the Play . I sate me downe , Deuis ' d a new Commission , wrote it faire , I once did hold it as our Statists doe , A basenesse to write faire ; and laboured much How to forget that learning : but Sir now , It did me Yeomans seriuce : wilt thou know The effects of what I wrote ? Hor . I , good my Lord Ham .
shakespeare#An earnest Coniuration from the King , As England was his faithfull Tributary , As loue betweene them , as the Palme should flourish , As Peace should still her wheaten Garland weare , And stand a Comma ' tweene their amities , And many such like Assis of great charge , That on the view and know of these Contents , Without debatement further , more or lesse , He should the bearers put to sodaine death , Not shriuing time allowed Hor . How was this seal ' d ? Ham . Why , euen in that was Heauen ordinate ; I had my fathers Signet in my Purse , Which was the Modell of that Danish Seale : Folded the Writ vp in forme of the other , Subscrib ' d it , gau ' t th ' impression , plac ' t it safely , The changeling neuer knowne : Now , the next day Was our Sea Fight , and what to this was sement , Thou know ' st already Hor .
shakespeare#So Guildensterne and Rosincrance , go too ' t Ham . Why man , they did make loue to this imployment They are not neere my Conscience ; their debate Doth by their owne insinuation grow : ' Tis dangerous , when the baser nature comes Betweene the passe , and fell incensed points Of mighty opposites Hor . Why , what a King is this ? Ham .
shakespeare#Does it not , thinkst thee , stand me now vpon He that hath kil ' d my King , and whor ' d my Mother , Popt in betweene th ' election and my hopes , Throwne out his Angle for my proper life , And with such coozenage ; is ' t not perfect conscience , To quit him with this arme ? And is ' t not to be damn ' d To let this Canker of our nature come In further euill Hor . It must be shortly knowne to him from England What is the issue of the businesse there Ham . It will be short , The interim ' s mine , and a mans life ' s no more Then to say one : but I am very sorry good Horatio , That to Laertes I forgot my selfe ; For by the image of my Cause , I see The Portraiture of his ; Ile count his fauours : But sure the brauery of his griefe did put me Into a Towring passion
shakespeare#Hor . Peace , who comes heere ? Enter young Osricke . Osr . Your Lordship is right welcome back to Denmarke Ham .
shakespeare#I humbly thank you Sir , dost know this waterflie ? Hor . No my good Lord Ham . Thy state is the more gracious ; for ' tis a vice to know him : he hath much Land , and fertile ; let a Beast be Lord of Beasts , and his Crib shall stand at the Kings Messe ; ' tis a Chowgh ; but as I saw spacious in the possession of dirt Osr .
shakespeare#Sweet Lord , if your friendship were at leysure , I should impart a thing to you from his Maiesty Ham . I will receiue it with all diligence of spirit ; put your Bonet to his right vse , ' tis for the head Osr . I thanke your Lordship , ' tis very hot Ham .
shakespeare#No , beleeue mee ' tis very cold , the winde is Northerly Osr . It is indifferent cold my Lord indeed Ham . Mee thinkes it is very soultry , and hot for my Complexion Osr .
shakespeare#Exceedingly , my Lord , it is very soultry , as ' twere I cannot tell how : but my Lord , his Maiesty bad me signifie to you , that he ha ' s laid a great wager on your head : Sir , this is the matter Ham . I beseech you remember Osr . Nay , in good faith , for mine ease in good faith : Sir , you are not ignorant of what excellence Laertes is at his weapon Ham .
shakespeare#What ' s his weapon ? Osr . Rapier and dagger Ham . That ' s two of his weapons ; but well Osr .
shakespeare#The sir King ha ' s wag ' d with him six Barbary horses , against the which he impon ' d as I take it , sixe French Rapiers and Poniards , with their assignes , as Girdle , Hangers or so : three of the Carriages infaith are very deare to fancy , very responsiue to the hilts , most delicate carriages , and of very liberall conceit Ham . What call you the Carriages ? Osr . The Carriages Sir , are the hangers Ham .
shakespeare#The phrase would bee more Germaine to the matter : If we could carry Cannon by our sides ; I would it might be Hangers till then ; but on sixe Barbary Horses against sixe French Swords : their Assignes , and three liberall conceited Carriages , that ' s the French but against the Danish ; why is this impon ' d as you call it ? Osr . The King Sir , hath laid that in a dozen passes betweene you and him , hee shall not exceed you three hits ; He hath one twelue for mine , and that would come to imediate tryall , if your Lordship would vouchsafe the Answere Ham . How if I answere no ? Osr .
shakespeare#I meane my Lord , the opposition of your person in tryall Ham . Sir , I will walke heere in the Hall ; if it please his Maiestie , ' tis the breathing time of day with me ; let the Foyles bee brought , the Gentleman willing , and the King hold his purpose ; I will win for him if I can : if not , Ile gaine nothing but my shame , and the odde hits Osr . Shall I redeliuer you ee ' n so ? Ham .
shakespeare#To this effect Sir , after what flourish your nature will Osr . I commend my duty to your Lordship Ham . Yours , yours ; hee does well to commend it himselfe , there are no tongues else for ' s tongue Hor .
shakespeare#This Lapwing runs away with the shell on his head Ham . He did Complie with his Dugge before hee suck ' t it : thus had he and mine more of the same Beauty that I know the drossie age dotes on ; only got the tune of the time , and outward habite of encounter , a kinde of yesty collection , which carries them through & through the most fond and winnowed opinions ; and doe but blow them to their tryalls : the Bubbles are out Hor . You will lose this wager , my Lord Ham .
