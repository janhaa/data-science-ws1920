austen#[ Emma by Jane Austen 1816 ] VOLUME I CHAPTER I Emma Woodhouse , handsome , clever , and rich , with a comfortable home and happy disposition , seemed to unite some of the best blessings of existence ; and had lived nearly twenty - one years in the world with very little to distress or vex her . She was the youngest of the two daughters of a most affectionate , indulgent father ; and had , in consequence of her sister ' s marriage , been mistress of his house from a very early period . Her mother had died too long ago for her to have more than an indistinct remembrance of her caresses ; and her place had been supplied by an excellent woman as governess , who had fallen little short of a mother in affection .
austen#Sixteen years had Miss Taylor been in Mr . Woodhouse ' s family , less as a governess than a friend , very fond of both daughters , but particularly of Emma . Between _them_ it was more the intimacy of sisters . Even before Miss Taylor had ceased to hold the nominal office of governess , the mildness of her temper had hardly allowed her to impose any restraint ; and the shadow of authority being now long passed away , they had been living together as friend and friend very mutually attached , and Emma doing just what she liked ; highly esteeming Miss Taylor ' s judgment , but directed chiefly by her own . The real evils , indeed , of Emma ' s situation were the power of having rather too much her own way , and a disposition to think a little too well of herself ; these were the disadvantages which threatened alloy to her many enjoyments . The danger , however , was at present so unperceived , that they did not by any means rank as misfortunes with her . Sorrow came -- a gentle sorrow -- but not at all in the shape of any disagreeable consciousness .-- Miss Taylor married .
austen#It was Miss Taylor ' s loss which first brought grief . It was on the wedding - day of this beloved friend that Emma first sat in mournful thought of any continuance . The wedding over , and the bride - people gone , her father and herself were left to dine together , with no prospect of a third to cheer a long evening . Her father composed himself to sleep after dinner , as usual , and she had then only to sit and think of what she had lost . The event had every promise of happiness for her friend . Mr . Weston was a man of unexceptionable character , easy fortune , suitable age , and pleasant manners ; and there was some satisfaction in considering with what self - denying , generous friendship she had always wished and promoted the match ; but it was a black morning ' s work for her .
austen#The want of Miss Taylor would be felt every hour of every day . She recalled her past kindness -- the kindness , the affection of sixteen years -- how she had taught and how she had played with her from five years old -- how she had devoted all her powers to attach and amuse her in health -- and how nursed her through the various illnesses of childhood . A large debt of gratitude was owing here ; but the intercourse of the last seven years , the equal footing and perfect unreserve which had soon followed Isabella ' s marriage , on their being left to each other , was yet a dearer , tenderer recollection . She had been a friend and companion such as few possessed : intelligent , well - informed , useful , gentle , knowing all the ways of the family , interested in all its concerns , and peculiarly interested in herself , in every pleasure , every scheme of hers -- one to whom she could speak every thought as it arose , and who had such an affection for her as could never find fault . How was she to bear the change ?-- It was true that her friend was going only half a mile from them ; but Emma was aware that great must be the difference between a Mrs . Weston , only half a mile from them , and a Miss Taylor in the house ; and with all her advantages , natural and domestic , she was now in great danger of suffering from intellectual solitude . She dearly loved her father , but he was no companion for her .
austen#He could not meet her in conversation , rational or playful . The evil of the actual disparity in their ages ( and Mr . Woodhouse had not married early ) was much increased by his constitution and habits ; for having been a valetudinarian all his life , without activity of mind or body , he was a much older man in ways than in years ; and though everywhere beloved for the friendliness of his heart and his amiable temper , his talents could not have recommended him at any time . Her sister , though comparatively but little removed by matrimony , being settled in London , only sixteen miles off , was much beyond her daily reach ; and many a long October and November evening must be struggled through at Hartfield , before Christmas brought the next visit from Isabella and her husband , and their little children , to fill the house , and give her pleasant society again . Highbury , the large and populous village , almost amounting to a town , to which Hartfield , in spite of its separate lawn , and shrubberies , and name , did really belong , afforded her no equals . The Woodhouses were first in consequence there . All looked up to them .
austen#She had many acquaintance in the place , for her father was universally civil , but not one among them who could be accepted in lieu of Miss Taylor for even half a day . It was a melancholy change ; and Emma could not but sigh over it , and wish for impossible things , till her father awoke , and made it necessary to be cheerful . His spirits required support . He was a nervous man , easily depressed ; fond of every body that he was used to , and hating to part with them ; hating change of every kind . Matrimony , as the origin of change , was always disagreeable ; and he was by no means yet reconciled to his own daughter ' s marrying , nor could ever speak of her but with compassion , though it had been entirely a match of affection , when he was now obliged to part with Miss Taylor too ; and from his habits of gentle selfishness , and of being never able to suppose that other people could feel differently from himself , he was very much disposed to think Miss Taylor had done as sad a thing for herself as for them , and would have been a great deal happier if she had spent all the rest of her life at Hartfield . Emma smiled and chatted as cheerfully as she could , to keep him from such thoughts ; but when tea came , it was impossible for him not to say exactly as he had said at dinner ,
austen#""" Poor Miss Taylor !-- I wish she were here again . What a pity it is that Mr . Weston ever thought of her !"" "" I cannot agree with you , papa ; you know I cannot . Mr . Weston is such a good - humoured , pleasant , excellent man , that he thoroughly deserves a good wife ;-- and you would not have had Miss Taylor live with us for ever , and bear all my odd humours , when she might have a house of her own ?"" "" A house of her own !-- But where is the advantage of a house of her own ? This is three times as large .-- And you have never any odd humours , my dear ."""
austen#""" How often we shall be going to see them , and they coming to see us !-- We shall be always meeting ! _We_ must begin ; we must go and pay wedding visit very soon ."" "" My dear , how am I to get so far ? Randalls is such a distance . I could not walk half so far ."" "" No , papa , nobody thought of your walking ."
austen#"We must go in the carriage , to be sure ."" "" The carriage ! But James will not like to put the horses to for such a little way ;-- and where are the poor horses to be while we are paying our visit ?"" "" They are to be put into Mr . Weston ' s stable , papa . You know we have settled all that already . We talked it all over with Mr . Weston last night ."
austen#"And as for James , you may be very sure he will always like going to Randalls , because of his daughter ' s being housemaid there . I only doubt whether he will ever take us anywhere else . That was your doing , papa . You got Hannah that good place . Nobody thought of Hannah till you mentioned her -- James is so obliged to you !"" "" I am very glad I did think of her ."
austen#"It was very lucky , for I would not have had poor James think himself slighted upon any account ; and I am sure she will make a very good servant : she is a civil , pretty - spoken girl ; I have a great opinion of her . Whenever I see her , she always curtseys and asks me how I do , in a very pretty manner ; and when you have had her here to do needlework , I observe she always turns the lock of the door the right way and never bangs it . I am sure she will be an excellent servant ; and it will be a great comfort to poor Miss Taylor to have somebody about her that she is used to see . Whenever James goes over to see his daughter , you know , she will be hearing of us . He will be able to tell her how we all are ."" Emma spared no exertions to maintain this happier flow of ideas , and hoped , by the help of backgammon , to get her father tolerably through the evening , and be attacked by no regrets but her own ."
austen#"The backgammon - table was placed ; but a visitor immediately afterwards walked in and made it unnecessary . Mr . Knightley , a sensible man about seven or eight - and - thirty , was not only a very old and intimate friend of the family , but particularly connected with it , as the elder brother of Isabella ' s husband . He lived about a mile from Highbury , was a frequent visitor , and always welcome , and at this time more welcome than usual , as coming directly from their mutual connexions in London . He had returned to a late dinner , after some days ' absence , and now walked up to Hartfield to say that all were well in Brunswick Square . It was a happy circumstance , and animated Mr . Woodhouse for some time . Mr . Knightley had a cheerful manner , which always did him good ; and his many inquiries after "" poor Isabella "" and her children were answered most satisfactorily ."
austen#"When this was over , Mr . Woodhouse gratefully observed , "" It is very kind of you , Mr . Knightley , to come out at this late hour to call upon us . I am afraid you must have had a shocking walk ."" "" Not at all , sir . It is a beautiful moonlight night ; and so mild that I must draw back from your great fire ."" "" But you must have found it very damp and dirty . I wish you may not catch cold ."""
austen#""" Dirty , sir ! Look at my shoes . Not a speck on them ."" "" Well ! that is quite surprising , for we have had a vast deal of rain here . It rained dreadfully hard for half an hour while we were at breakfast ."
austen#"I wanted them to put off the wedding ."" "" By the bye -- I have not wished you joy . Being pretty well aware of what sort of joy you must both be feeling , I have been in no hurry with my congratulations ; but I hope it all went off tolerably well . How did you all behave ? Who cried most ?"" "" Ah !"
austen#"poor Miss Taylor ! ' Tis a sad business ."" "" Poor Mr . and Miss Woodhouse , if you please ; but I cannot possibly say ` poor Miss Taylor .' I have a great regard for you and Emma ; but when it comes to the question of dependence or independence !-- At any rate , it must be better to have only one to please than two ."" "" Especially when _one_ of those two is such a fanciful , troublesome creature !"" said Emma playfully ."
austen#""" That is what you have in your head , I know -- and what you would certainly say if my father were not by ."" "" I believe it is very true , my dear , indeed ,"" said Mr . Woodhouse , with a sigh . "" I am afraid I am sometimes very fanciful and troublesome ."" "" My dearest papa ! You do not think I could mean _you_ , or suppose Mr . Knightley to mean _you_ . What a horrible idea !"
austen#"Oh no ! I meant only myself . Mr . Knightley loves to find fault with me , you know -- in a joke -- it is all a joke . We always say what we like to one another ."" Mr . Knightley , in fact , was one of the few people who could see faults in Emma Woodhouse , and the only one who ever told her of them : and though this was not particularly agreeable to Emma herself , she knew it would be so much less so to her father , that she would not have him really suspect such a circumstance as her not being thought perfect by every body . "" Emma knows I never flatter her ,"" said Mr . Knightley , "" but I meant no reflection on any body ."
austen#"Miss Taylor has been used to have two persons to please ; she will now have but one . The chances are that she must be a gainer ."" "" Well ,"" said Emma , willing to let it pass --"" you want to hear about the wedding ; and I shall be happy to tell you , for we all behaved charmingly . Every body was punctual , every body in their best looks : not a tear , and hardly a long face to be seen . Oh no ; we all felt that we were going to be only half a mile apart , and were sure of meeting every day ."" "" Dear Emma bears every thing so well ,"" said her father ."
austen#""" But , Mr . Knightley , she is really very sorry to lose poor Miss Taylor , and I am sure she _will_ miss her more than she thinks for ."" Emma turned away her head , divided between tears and smiles . "" It is impossible that Emma should not miss such a companion ,"" said Mr . Knightley . "" We should not like her so well as we do , sir , if we could suppose it ; but she knows how much the marriage is to Miss Taylor ' s advantage ; she knows how very acceptable it must be , at Miss Taylor ' s time of life , to be settled in a home of her own , and how important to her to be secure of a comfortable provision , and therefore cannot allow herself to feel so much pain as pleasure . Every friend of Miss Taylor must be glad to have her so happily married ."" "" And you have forgotten one matter of joy to me ,"" said Emma , "" and a very considerable one -- that I made the match myself ."
austen#"I made the match , you know , four years ago ; and to have it take place , and be proved in the right , when so many people said Mr . Weston would never marry again , may comfort me for any thing ."" Mr . Knightley shook his head at her . Her father fondly replied , "" Ah ! my dear , I wish you would not make matches and foretell things , for whatever you say always comes to pass . Pray do not make any more matches ."" "" I promise you to make none for myself , papa ; but I must , indeed , for other people ."
austen#It is the greatest amusement in the world ! And after such success , you know !-- Every body said that Mr . Weston would never marry again . Oh dear , no ! Mr . Weston , who had been a widower so long , and who seemed so perfectly comfortable without a wife , so constantly occupied either in his business in town or among his friends here , always acceptable wherever he went , always cheerful -- Mr . Weston need not spend a single evening in the year alone if he did not like it . Oh no ! Mr . Weston certainly would never marry again .
austen#"Some people even talked of a promise to his wife on her deathbed , and others of the son and the uncle not letting him . All manner of solemn nonsense was talked on the subject , but I believed none of it . "" Ever since the day -- about four years ago -- that Miss Taylor and I met with him in Broadway Lane , when , because it began to drizzle , he darted away with so much gallantry , and borrowed two umbrellas for us from Farmer Mitchell ' s , I made up my mind on the subject . I planned the match from that hour ; and when such success has blessed me in this instance , dear papa , you cannot think that I shall leave off match - making ."" "" I do not understand what you mean by ` success ,'"" said Mr . Knightley . "" Success supposes endeavour ."
austen#"Your time has been properly and delicately spent , if you have been endeavouring for the last four years to bring about this marriage . A worthy employment for a young lady ' s mind ! But if , which I rather imagine , your making the match , as you call it , means only your planning it , your saying to yourself one idle day , ` I think it would be a very good thing for Miss Taylor if Mr . Weston were to marry her ,' and saying it again to yourself every now and then afterwards , why do you talk of success ? Where is your merit ? What are you proud of ? You made a lucky guess ; and _that_ is all that can be said ."""
austen#""" And have you never known the pleasure and triumph of a lucky guess ?-- I pity you .-- I thought you cleverer -- for , depend upon it a lucky guess is never merely luck . There is always some talent in it . And as to my poor word ` success ,' which you quarrel with , I do not know that I am so entirely without any claim to it . You have drawn two pretty pictures ; but I think there may be a third -- a something between the do - nothing and the do - all . If I had not promoted Mr . Weston ' s visits here , and given many little encouragements , and smoothed many little matters , it might not have come to any thing after all . I think you must know Hartfield enough to comprehend that ."""
austen#""" A straightforward , open - hearted man like Weston , and a rational , unaffected woman like Miss Taylor , may be safely left to manage their own concerns . You are more likely to have done harm to yourself , than good to them , by interference ."" "" Emma never thinks of herself , if she can do good to others ,"" rejoined Mr . Woodhouse , understanding but in part . "" But , my dear , pray do not make any more matches ; they are silly things , and break up one ' s family circle grievously ."" "" Only one more , papa ; only for Mr . Elton . Poor Mr . Elton !"
austen#"You like Mr . Elton , papa ,-- I must look about for a wife for him . There is nobody in Highbury who deserves him -- and he has been here a whole year , and has fitted up his house so comfortably , that it would be a shame to have him single any longer -- and I thought when he was joining their hands to - day , he looked so very much as if he would like to have the same kind office done for him ! I think very well of Mr . Elton , and this is the only way I have of doing him a service ."" "" Mr . Elton is a very pretty young man , to be sure , and a very good young man , and I have a great regard for him . But if you want to shew him any attention , my dear , ask him to come and dine with us some day . That will be a much better thing ."
austen#"I dare say Mr . Knightley will be so kind as to meet him ."" "" With a great deal of pleasure , sir , at any time ,"" said Mr . Knightley , laughing , "" and I agree with you entirely , that it will be a much better thing . Invite him to dinner , Emma , and help him to the best of the fish and the chicken , but leave him to chuse his own wife . Depend upon it , a man of six or seven - and - twenty can take care of himself ."" CHAPTER II Mr . Weston was a native of Highbury , and born of a respectable family , which for the last two or three generations had been rising into gentility and property ."
austen#He had received a good education , but , on succeeding early in life to a small independence , had become indisposed for any of the more homely pursuits in which his brothers were engaged , and had satisfied an active , cheerful mind and social temper by entering into the militia of his county , then embodied . Captain Weston was a general favourite ; and when the chances of his military life had introduced him to Miss Churchill , of a great Yorkshire family , and Miss Churchill fell in love with him , nobody was surprized , except her brother and his wife , who had never seen him , and who were full of pride and importance , which the connexion would offend . Miss Churchill , however , being of age , and with the full command of her fortune -- though her fortune bore no proportion to the family - estate -- was not to be dissuaded from the marriage , and it took place , to the infinite mortification of Mr . and Mrs . Churchill , who threw her off with due decorum . It was an unsuitable connexion , and did not produce much happiness . Mrs . Weston ought to have found more in it , for she had a husband whose warm heart and sweet temper made him think every thing due to her in return for the great goodness of being in love with him ; but though she had one sort of spirit , she had not the best . She had resolution enough to pursue her own will in spite of her brother , but not enough to refrain from unreasonable regrets at that brother ' s unreasonable anger , nor from missing the luxuries of her former home .
austen#They lived beyond their income , but still it was nothing in comparison of Enscombe : she did not cease to love her husband , but she wanted at once to be the wife of Captain Weston , and Miss Churchill of Enscombe . Captain Weston , who had been considered , especially by the Churchills , as making such an amazing match , was proved to have much the worst of the bargain ; for when his wife died , after a three years ' marriage , he was rather a poorer man than at first , and with a child to maintain . From the expense of the child , however , he was soon relieved . The boy had , with the additional softening claim of a lingering illness of his mother ' s , been the means of a sort of reconciliation ; and Mr . and Mrs . Churchill , having no children of their own , nor any other young creature of equal kindred to care for , offered to take the whole charge of the little Frank soon after her decease . Some scruples and some reluctance the widower - father may be supposed to have felt ; but as they were overcome by other considerations , the child was given up to the care and the wealth of the Churchills , and he had only his own comfort to seek , and his own situation to improve as he could . A complete change of life became desirable .
austen#He quitted the militia and engaged in trade , having brothers already established in a good way in London , which afforded him a favourable opening . It was a concern which brought just employment enough . He had still a small house in Highbury , where most of his leisure days were spent ; and between useful occupation and the pleasures of society , the next eighteen or twenty years of his life passed cheerfully away . He had , by that time , realised an easy competence -- enough to secure the purchase of a little estate adjoining Highbury , which he had always longed for -- enough to marry a woman as portionless even as Miss Taylor , and to live according to the wishes of his own friendly and social disposition . It was now some time since Miss Taylor had begun to influence his schemes ; but as it was not the tyrannic influence of youth on youth , it had not shaken his determination of never settling till he could purchase Randalls , and the sale of Randalls was long looked forward to ; but he had gone steadily on , with these objects in view , till they were accomplished . He had made his fortune , bought his house , and obtained his wife ; and was beginning a new period of existence , with every probability of greater happiness than in any yet passed through .
austen#He had never been an unhappy man ; his own temper had secured him from that , even in his first marriage ; but his second must shew him how delightful a well - judging and truly amiable woman could be , and must give him the pleasantest proof of its being a great deal better to choose than to be chosen , to excite gratitude than to feel it . He had only himself to please in his choice : his fortune was his own ; for as to Frank , it was more than being tacitly brought up as his uncle ' s heir , it had become so avowed an adoption as to have him assume the name of Churchill on coming of age . It was most unlikely , therefore , that he should ever want his father ' s assistance . His father had no apprehension of it . The aunt was a capricious woman , and governed her husband entirely ; but it was not in Mr . Weston ' s nature to imagine that any caprice could be strong enough to affect one so dear , and , as he believed , so deservedly dear . He saw his son every year in London , and was proud of him ; and his fond report of him as a very fine young man had made Highbury feel a sort of pride in him too .
austen#He was looked on as sufficiently belonging to the place to make his merits and prospects a kind of common concern . Mr . Frank Churchill was one of the boasts of Highbury , and a lively curiosity to see him prevailed , though the compliment was so little returned that he had never been there in his life . His coming to visit his father had been often talked of but never achieved . Now , upon his father ' s marriage , it was very generally proposed , as a most proper attention , that the visit should take place . There was not a dissentient voice on the subject , either when Mrs . Perry drank tea with Mrs . and Miss Bates , or when Mrs . and Miss Bates returned the visit . Now was the time for Mr . Frank Churchill to come among them ; and the hope strengthened when it was understood that he had written to his new mother on the occasion .
austen#"For a few days , every morning visit in Highbury included some mention of the handsome letter Mrs . Weston had received . "" I suppose you have heard of the handsome letter Mr . Frank Churchill has written to Mrs . Weston ? I understand it was a very handsome letter , indeed . Mr . Woodhouse told me of it . Mr . Woodhouse saw the letter , and he says he never saw such a handsome letter in his life ."" It was , indeed , a highly prized letter ."
austen#"Mrs . Weston had , of course , formed a very favourable idea of the young man ; and such a pleasing attention was an irresistible proof of his great good sense , and a most welcome addition to every source and every expression of congratulation which her marriage had already secured . She felt herself a most fortunate woman ; and she had lived long enough to know how fortunate she might well be thought , where the only regret was for a partial separation from friends whose friendship for her had never cooled , and who could ill bear to part with her . She knew that at times she must be missed ; and could not think , without pain , of Emma ' s losing a single pleasure , or suffering an hour ' s ennui , from the want of her companionableness : but dear Emma was of no feeble character ; she was more equal to her situation than most girls would have been , and had sense , and energy , and spirits that might be hoped would bear her well and happily through its little difficulties and privations . And then there was such comfort in the very easy distance of Randalls from Hartfield , so convenient for even solitary female walking , and in Mr . Weston ' s disposition and circumstances , which would make the approaching season no hindrance to their spending half the evenings in the week together . Her situation was altogether the subject of hours of gratitude to Mrs . Weston , and of moments only of regret ; and her satisfaction -- her more than satisfaction -- her cheerful enjoyment , was so just and so apparent , that Emma , well as she knew her father , was sometimes taken by surprize at his being still able to pity ` poor Miss Taylor ,' when they left her at Randalls in the centre of every domestic comfort , or saw her go away in the evening attended by her pleasant husband to a carriage of her own . But never did she go without Mr . Woodhouse ' s giving a gentle sigh , and saying , "" Ah , poor Miss Taylor !"
austen#"She would be very glad to stay ."" There was no recovering Miss Taylor -- nor much likelihood of ceasing to pity her ; but a few weeks brought some alleviation to Mr . Woodhouse . The compliments of his neighbours were over ; he was no longer teased by being wished joy of so sorrowful an event ; and the wedding - cake , which had been a great distress to him , was all eat up . His own stomach could bear nothing rich , and he could never believe other people to be different from himself . What was unwholesome to him he regarded as unfit for any body ; and he had , therefore , earnestly tried to dissuade them from having any wedding - cake at all , and when that proved vain , as earnestly tried to prevent any body ' s eating it . He had been at the pains of consulting Mr . Perry , the apothecary , on the subject ."
austen#Mr . Perry was an intelligent , gentlemanlike man , whose frequent visits were one of the comforts of Mr . Woodhouse ' s life ; and upon being applied to , he could not but acknowledge ( though it seemed rather against the bias of inclination ) that wedding - cake might certainly disagree with many -- perhaps with most people , unless taken moderately . With such an opinion , in confirmation of his own , Mr . Woodhouse hoped to influence every visitor of the newly married pair ; but still the cake was eaten ; and there was no rest for his benevolent nerves till it was all gone . There was a strange rumour in Highbury of all the little Perrys being seen with a slice of Mrs . Weston ' s wedding - cake in their hands : but Mr . Woodhouse would never believe it . CHAPTER III Mr . Woodhouse was fond of society in his own way . He liked very much to have his friends come and see him ; and from various united causes , from his long residence at Hartfield , and his good nature , from his fortune , his house , and his daughter , he could command the visits of his own little circle , in a great measure , as he liked .
austen#He had not much intercourse with any families beyond that circle ; his horror of late hours , and large dinner - parties , made him unfit for any acquaintance but such as would visit him on his own terms . Fortunately for him , Highbury , including Randalls in the same parish , and Donwell Abbey in the parish adjoining , the seat of Mr . Knightley , comprehended many such . Not unfrequently , through Emma ' s persuasion , he had some of the chosen and the best to dine with him : but evening parties were what he preferred ; and , unless he fancied himself at any time unequal to company , there was scarcely an evening in the week in which Emma could not make up a card - table for him . Real , long - standing regard brought the Westons and Mr . Knightley ; and by Mr . Elton , a young man living alone without liking it , the privilege of exchanging any vacant evening of his own blank solitude for the elegancies and society of Mr . Woodhouse ' s drawing - room , and the smiles of his lovely daughter , was in no danger of being thrown away . After these came a second set ; among the most come - at - able of whom were Mrs . and Miss Bates , and Mrs . Goddard , three ladies almost always at the service of an invitation from Hartfield , and who were fetched and carried home so often , that Mr . Woodhouse thought it no hardship for either James or the horses . Had it taken place only once a year , it would have been a grievance .
austen#Mrs . Bates , the widow of a former vicar of Highbury , was a very old lady , almost past every thing but tea and quadrille . She lived with her single daughter in a very small way , and was considered with all the regard and respect which a harmless old lady , under such untoward circumstances , can excite . Her daughter enjoyed a most uncommon degree of popularity for a woman neither young , handsome , rich , nor married . Miss Bates stood in the very worst predicament in the world for having much of the public favour ; and she had no intellectual superiority to make atonement to herself , or frighten those who might hate her into outward respect . She had never boasted either beauty or cleverness . Her youth had passed without distinction , and her middle of life was devoted to the care of a failing mother , and the endeavour to make a small income go as far as possible .
austen#And yet she was a happy woman , and a woman whom no one named without good - will . It was her own universal good - will and contented temper which worked such wonders . She loved every body , was interested in every body ' s happiness , quicksighted to every body ' s merits ; thought herself a most fortunate creature , and surrounded with blessings in such an excellent mother , and so many good neighbours and friends , and a home that wanted for nothing . The simplicity and cheerfulness of her nature , her contented and grateful spirit , were a recommendation to every body , and a mine of felicity to herself . She was a great talker upon little matters , which exactly suited Mr . Woodhouse , full of trivial communications and harmless gossip . Mrs . Goddard was the mistress of a School -- not of a seminary , or an establishment , or any thing which professed , in long sentences of refined nonsense , to combine liberal acquirements with elegant morality , upon new principles and new systems -- and where young ladies for enormous pay might be screwed out of health and into vanity -- but a real , honest , old - fashioned Boarding - school , where a reasonable quantity of accomplishments were sold at a reasonable price , and where girls might be sent to be out of the way , and scramble themselves into a little education , without any danger of coming back prodigies .
austen#Mrs . Goddard ' s school was in high repute -- and very deservedly ; for Highbury was reckoned a particularly healthy spot : she had an ample house and garden , gave the children plenty of wholesome food , let them run about a great deal in the summer , and in winter dressed their chilblains with her own hands . It was no wonder that a train of twenty young couple now walked after her to church . She was a plain , motherly kind of woman , who had worked hard in her youth , and now thought herself entitled to the occasional holiday of a tea - visit ; and having formerly owed much to Mr . Woodhouse ' s kindness , felt his particular claim on her to leave her neat parlour , hung round with fancy - work , whenever she could , and win or lose a few sixpences by his fireside . These were the ladies whom Emma found herself very frequently able to collect ; and happy was she , for her father ' s sake , in the power ; though , as far as she was herself concerned , it was no remedy for the absence of Mrs . Weston . She was delighted to see her father look comfortable , and very much pleased with herself for contriving things so well ; but the quiet prosings of three such women made her feel that every evening so spent was indeed one of the long evenings she had fearfully anticipated . As she sat one morning , looking forward to exactly such a close of the present day , a note was brought from Mrs . Goddard , requesting , in most respectful terms , to be allowed to bring Miss Smith with her ; a most welcome request : for Miss Smith was a girl of seventeen , whom Emma knew very well by sight , and had long felt an interest in , on account of her beauty .
austen#A very gracious invitation was returned , and the evening no longer dreaded by the fair mistress of the mansion . Harriet Smith was the natural daughter of somebody . Somebody had placed her , several years back , at Mrs . Goddard ' s school , and somebody had lately raised her from the condition of scholar to that of parlour - boarder . This was all that was generally known of her history . She had no visible friends but what had been acquired at Highbury , and was now just returned from a long visit in the country to some young ladies who had been at school there with her . She was a very pretty girl , and her beauty happened to be of a sort which Emma particularly admired .
austen#She was short , plump , and fair , with a fine bloom , blue eyes , light hair , regular features , and a look of great sweetness , and , before the end of the evening , Emma was as much pleased with her manners as her person , and quite determined to continue the acquaintance . She was not struck by any thing remarkably clever in Miss Smith ' s conversation , but she found her altogether very engaging -- not inconveniently shy , not unwilling to talk -- and yet so far from pushing , shewing so proper and becoming a deference , seeming so pleasantly grateful for being admitted to Hartfield , and so artlessly impressed by the appearance of every thing in so superior a style to what she had been used to , that she must have good sense , and deserve encouragement . Encouragement should be given . Those soft blue eyes , and all those natural graces , should not be wasted on the inferior society of Highbury and its connexions . The acquaintance she had already formed were unworthy of her . The friends from whom she had just parted , though very good sort of people , must be doing her harm .
austen#They were a family of the name of Martin , whom Emma well knew by character , as renting a large farm of Mr . Knightley , and residing in the parish of Donwell -- very creditably , she believed -- she knew Mr . Knightley thought highly of them -- but they must be coarse and unpolished , and very unfit to be the intimates of a girl who wanted only a little more knowledge and elegance to be quite perfect . _She_ would notice her ; she would improve her ; she would detach her from her bad acquaintance , and introduce her into good society ; she would form her opinions and her manners . It would be an interesting , and certainly a very kind undertaking ; highly becoming her own situation in life , her leisure , and powers . She was so busy in admiring those soft blue eyes , in talking and listening , and forming all these schemes in the in - betweens , that the evening flew away at a very unusual rate ; and the supper - table , which always closed such parties , and for which she had been used to sit and watch the due time , was all set out and ready , and moved forwards to the fire , before she was aware . With an alacrity beyond the common impulse of a spirit which yet was never indifferent to the credit of doing every thing well and attentively , with the real good - will of a mind delighted with its own ideas , did she then do all the honours of the meal , and help and recommend the minced chicken and scalloped oysters , with an urgency which she knew would be acceptable to the early hours and civil scruples of their guests . Upon such occasions poor Mr . Woodhouses feelings were in sad warfare .
austen#"He loved to have the cloth laid , because it had been the fashion of his youth , but his conviction of suppers being very unwholesome made him rather sorry to see any thing put on it ; and while his hospitality would have welcomed his visitors to every thing , his care for their health made him grieve that they would eat . Such another small basin of thin gruel as his own was all that he could , with thorough self - approbation , recommend ; though he might constrain himself , while the ladies were comfortably clearing the nicer things , to say : "" Mrs . Bates , let me propose your venturing on one of these eggs . An egg boiled very soft is not unwholesome . Serle understands boiling an egg better than any body . I would not recommend an egg boiled by any body else ; but you need not be afraid , they are very small , you see -- one of our small eggs will not hurt you ."
austen#Miss Bates , let Emma help you to a _little_ bit of tart -- a _very_ little bit . Ours are all apple - tarts . You need not be afraid of unwholesome preserves here . I do not advise the custard . Mrs . Goddard , what say you to _half_ a glass of wine ? A _small_ half - glass , put into a tumbler of water ?
austen#"I do not think it could disagree with you ."" Emma allowed her father to talk -- but supplied her visitors in a much more satisfactory style , and on the present evening had particular pleasure in sending them away happy . The happiness of Miss Smith was quite equal to her intentions . Miss Woodhouse was so great a personage in Highbury , that the prospect of the introduction had given as much panic as pleasure ; but the humble , grateful little girl went off with highly gratified feelings , delighted with the affability with which Miss Woodhouse had treated her all the evening , and actually shaken hands with her at last ! CHAPTER IV Harriet Smith ' s intimacy at Hartfield was soon a settled thing ."
austen#Quick and decided in her ways , Emma lost no time in inviting , encouraging , and telling her to come very often ; and as their acquaintance increased , so did their satisfaction in each other . As a walking companion , Emma had very early foreseen how useful she might find her . In that respect Mrs . Weston ' s loss had been important . Her father never went beyond the shrubbery , where two divisions of the ground sufficed him for his long walk , or his short , as the year varied ; and since Mrs . Weston ' s marriage her exercise had been too much confined . She had ventured once alone to Randalls , but it was not pleasant ; and a Harriet Smith , therefore , one whom she could summon at any time to a walk , would be a valuable addition to her privileges . But in every respect , as she saw more of her , she approved her , and was confirmed in all her kind designs .
austen#Harriet certainly was not clever , but she had a sweet , docile , grateful disposition , was totally free from conceit , and only desiring to be guided by any one she looked up to . Her early attachment to herself was very amiable ; and her inclination for good company , and power of appreciating what was elegant and clever , shewed that there was no want of taste , though strength of understanding must not be expected . Altogether she was quite convinced of Harriet Smith ' s being exactly the young friend she wanted -- exactly the something which her home required . Such a friend as Mrs . Weston was out of the question . Two such could never be granted . Two such she did not want .
austen#It was quite a different sort of thing , a sentiment distinct and independent . Mrs . Weston was the object of a regard which had its basis in gratitude and esteem . Harriet would be loved as one to whom she could be useful . For Mrs . Weston there was nothing to be done ; for Harriet every thing . Her first attempts at usefulness were in an endeavour to find out who were the parents , but Harriet could not tell . She was ready to tell every thing in her power , but on this subject questions were vain .
austen#"Emma was obliged to fancy what she liked -- but she could never believe that in the same situation _she_ should not have discovered the truth . Harriet had no penetration . She had been satisfied to hear and believe just what Mrs . Goddard chose to tell her ; and looked no farther . Mrs . Goddard , and the teachers , and the girls and the affairs of the school in general , formed naturally a great part of the conversation -- and but for her acquaintance with the Martins of Abbey - Mill Farm , it must have been the whole . But the Martins occupied her thoughts a good deal ; she had spent two very happy months with them , and now loved to talk of the pleasures of her visit , and describe the many comforts and wonders of the place . Emma encouraged her talkativeness -- amused by such a picture of another set of beings , and enjoying the youthful simplicity which could speak with so much exultation of Mrs . Martin ' s having "" _two_ parlours , two very good parlours , indeed ; one of them quite as large as Mrs . Goddard ' s drawing - room ; and of her having an upper maid who had lived five - and - twenty years with her ; and of their having eight cows , two of them Alderneys , and one a little Welch cow , a very pretty little Welch cow indeed ; and of Mrs . Martin ' s saying as she was so fond of it , it should be called _her_ cow ; and of their having a very handsome summer - house in their garden , where some day next year they were all to drink tea :-- a very handsome summer - house , large enough to hold a dozen people ."""
austen#For some time she was amused , without thinking beyond the immediate cause ; but as she came to understand the family better , other feelings arose . She had taken up a wrong idea , fancying it was a mother and daughter , a son and son ' s wife , who all lived together ; but when it appeared that the Mr . Martin , who bore a part in the narrative , and was always mentioned with approbation for his great good - nature in doing something or other , was a single man ; that there was no young Mrs . Martin , no wife in the case ; she did suspect danger to her poor little friend from all this hospitality and kindness , and that , if she were not taken care of , she might be required to sink herself forever . With this inspiriting notion , her questions increased in number and meaning ; and she particularly led Harriet to talk more of Mr . Martin , and there was evidently no dislike to it . Harriet was very ready to speak of the share he had had in their moonlight walks and merry evening games ; and dwelt a good deal upon his being so very good - humoured and obliging . He had gone three miles round one day in order to bring her some walnuts , because she had said how fond she was of them , and in every thing else he was so very obliging . He had his shepherd ' s son into the parlour one night on purpose to sing to her .
austen#She was very fond of singing . He could sing a little himself . She believed he was very clever , and understood every thing . He had a very fine flock , and , while she was with them , he had been bid more for his wool than any body in the country . She believed every body spoke well of him . His mother and sisters were very fond of him .
austen#"Mrs . Martin had told her one day ( and there was a blush as she said it ,) that it was impossible for any body to be a better son , and therefore she was sure , whenever he married , he would make a good husband . Not that she _wanted_ him to marry . She was in no hurry at all . "" Well done , Mrs . Martin !"" thought Emma ."
austen#""" You know what you are about ."" "" And when she had come away , Mrs . Martin was so very kind as to send Mrs . Goddard a beautiful goose -- the finest goose Mrs . Goddard had ever seen . Mrs . Goddard had dressed it on a Sunday , and asked all the three teachers , Miss Nash , and Miss Prince , and Miss Richardson , to sup with her ."" "" Mr . Martin , I suppose , is not a man of information beyond the line of his own business ? He does not read ?"" "" Oh yes !-- that is , no -- I do not know -- but I believe he has read a good deal -- but not what you would think any thing of ."
austen#"He reads the Agricultural Reports , and some other books that lay in one of the window seats -- but he reads all _them_ to himself . But sometimes of an evening , before we went to cards , he would read something aloud out of the Elegant Extracts , very entertaining . And I know he has read the Vicar of Wakefield . He never read the Romance of the Forest , nor The Children of the Abbey . He had never heard of such books before I mentioned them , but he is determined to get them now as soon as ever he can ."" The next question was --"
austen#""" What sort of looking man is Mr . Martin ?"" "" Oh ! not handsome -- not at all handsome . I thought him very plain at first , but I do not think him so plain now . One does not , you know , after a time ."
austen#"But did you never see him ? He is in Highbury every now and then , and he is sure to ride through every week in his way to Kingston . He has passed you very often ."" "" That may be , and I may have seen him fifty times , but without having any idea of his name . A young farmer , whether on horseback or on foot , is the very last sort of person to raise my curiosity . The yeomanry are precisely the order of people with whom I feel I can have nothing to do ."
austen#"A degree or two lower , and a creditable appearance might interest me ; I might hope to be useful to their families in some way or other . But a farmer can need none of my help , and is , therefore , in one sense , as much above my notice as in every other he is below it ."" "" To be sure . Oh yes ! It is not likely you should ever have observed him ; but he knows you very well indeed -- I mean by sight ."" "" I have no doubt of his being a very respectable young man ."
austen#"I know , indeed , that he is so , and , as such , wish him well . What do you imagine his age to be ?"" "" He was four - and - twenty the 8th of last June , and my birthday is the 23rd just a fortnight and a day ' s difference -- which is very odd ."" "" Only four - and - twenty . That is too young to settle . His mother is perfectly right not to be in a hurry ."
austen#"They seem very comfortable as they are , and if she were to take any pains to marry him , she would probably repent it . Six years hence , if he could meet with a good sort of young woman in the same rank as his own , with a little money , it might be very desirable ."" "" Six years hence ! Dear Miss Woodhouse , he would be thirty years old !"" "" Well , and that is as early as most men can afford to marry , who are not born to an independence . Mr . Martin , I imagine , has his fortune entirely to make -- cannot be at all beforehand with the world ."
austen#"Whatever money he might come into when his father died , whatever his share of the family property , it is , I dare say , all afloat , all employed in his stock , and so forth ; and though , with diligence and good luck , he may be rich in time , it is next to impossible that he should have realised any thing yet ."" "" To be sure , so it is . But they live very comfortably . They have no indoors man , else they do not want for any thing ; and Mrs . Martin talks of taking a boy another year ."" "" I wish you may not get into a scrape , Harriet , whenever he does marry ;-- I mean , as to being acquainted with his wife -- for though his sisters , from a superior education , are not to be altogether objected to , it does not follow that he might marry any body at all fit for you to notice . The misfortune of your birth ought to make you particularly careful as to your associates ."
austen#"There can be no doubt of your being a gentleman ' s daughter , and you must support your claim to that station by every thing within your own power , or there will be plenty of people who would take pleasure in degrading you ."" "" Yes , to be sure , I suppose there are . But while I visit at Hartfield , and you are so kind to me , Miss Woodhouse , I am not afraid of what any body can do ."" "" You understand the force of influence pretty well , Harriet ; but I would have you so firmly established in good society , as to be independent even of Hartfield and Miss Woodhouse . I want to see you permanently well connected , and to that end it will be advisable to have as few odd acquaintance as may be ; and , therefore , I say that if you should still be in this country when Mr . Martin marries , I wish you may not be drawn in by your intimacy with the sisters , to be acquainted with the wife , who will probably be some mere farmer ' s daughter , without education ."" "" To be sure ."
austen#"Yes . Not that I think Mr . Martin would ever marry any body but what had had some education -- and been very well brought up . However , I do not mean to set up my opinion against your ' s -- and I am sure I shall not wish for the acquaintance of his wife . I shall always have a great regard for the Miss Martins , especially Elizabeth , and should be very sorry to give them up , for they are quite as well educated as me . But if he marries a very ignorant , vulgar woman , certainly I had better not visit her , if I can help it ."" Emma watched her through the fluctuations of this speech , and saw no alarming symptoms of love ."
austen#The young man had been the first admirer , but she trusted there was no other hold , and that there would be no serious difficulty , on Harriet ' s side , to oppose any friendly arrangement of her own . They met Mr . Martin the very next day , as they were walking on the Donwell road . He was on foot , and after looking very respectfully at her , looked with most unfeigned satisfaction at her companion . Emma was not sorry to have such an opportunity of survey ; and walking a few yards forward , while they talked together , soon made her quick eye sufficiently acquainted with Mr . Robert Martin . His appearance was very neat , and he looked like a sensible young man , but his person had no other advantage ; and when he came to be contrasted with gentlemen , she thought he must lose all the ground he had gained in Harriet ' s inclination . Harriet was not insensible of manner ; she had voluntarily noticed her father ' s gentleness with admiration as well as wonder .
austen#"Mr . Martin looked as if he did not know what manner was . They remained but a few minutes together , as Miss Woodhouse must not be kept waiting ; and Harriet then came running to her with a smiling face , and in a flutter of spirits , which Miss Woodhouse hoped very soon to compose . "" Only think of our happening to meet him !-- How very odd ! It was quite a chance , he said , that he had not gone round by Randalls . He did not think we ever walked this road . He thought we walked towards Randalls most days ."
austen#"He has not been able to get the Romance of the Forest yet . He was so busy the last time he was at Kingston that he quite forgot it , but he goes again to - morrow . So very odd we should happen to meet ! Well , Miss Woodhouse , is he like what you expected ? What do you think of him ? Do you think him so very plain ?"""
austen#""" He is very plain , undoubtedly -- remarkably plain :-- but that is nothing compared with his entire want of gentility . I had no right to expect much , and I did not expect much ; but I had no idea that he could be so very clownish , so totally without air . I had imagined him , I confess , a degree or two nearer gentility ."" "" To be sure ,"" said Harriet , in a mortified voice , "" he is not so genteel as real gentlemen ."" "" I think , Harriet , since your acquaintance with us , you have been repeatedly in the company of some such very real gentlemen , that you must yourself be struck with the difference in Mr . Martin . At Hartfield , you have had very good specimens of well educated , well bred men ."
austen#"I should be surprized if , after seeing them , you could be in company with Mr . Martin again without perceiving him to be a very inferior creature -- and rather wondering at yourself for having ever thought him at all agreeable before . Do not you begin to feel that now ? Were not you struck ? I am sure you must have been struck by his awkward look and abrupt manner , and the uncouthness of a voice which I heard to be wholly unmodulated as I stood here ."" "" Certainly , he is not like Mr . Knightley . He has not such a fine air and way of walking as Mr . Knightley ."
austen#"I see the difference plain enough . But Mr . Knightley is so very fine a man !"" "" Mr . Knightley ' s air is so remarkably good that it is not fair to compare Mr . Martin with _him_ . You might not see one in a hundred with _gentleman_ so plainly written as in Mr . Knightley . But he is not the only gentleman you have been lately used to . What say you to Mr . Weston and Mr . Elton ?"
austen#"Compare Mr . Martin with either of _them_ . Compare their manner of carrying themselves ; of walking ; of speaking ; of being silent . You must see the difference ."" "" Oh yes !-- there is a great difference . But Mr . Weston is almost an old man . Mr . Weston must be between forty and fifty ."""
austen#""" Which makes his good manners the more valuable . The older a person grows , Harriet , the more important it is that their manners should not be bad ; the more glaring and disgusting any loudness , or coarseness , or awkwardness becomes . What is passable in youth is detestable in later age . Mr . Martin is now awkward and abrupt ; what will he be at Mr . Weston ' s time of life ?"" "" There is no saying , indeed ,"" replied Harriet rather solemnly . "" But there may be pretty good guessing ."
austen#"He will be a completely gross , vulgar farmer , totally inattentive to appearances , and thinking of nothing but profit and loss ."" "" Will he , indeed ? That will be very bad ."" "" How much his business engrosses him already is very plain from the circumstance of his forgetting to inquire for the book you recommended . He was a great deal too full of the market to think of any thing else -- which is just as it should be , for a thriving man . What has he to do with books ?"
austen#"And I have no doubt that he _will_ thrive , and be a very rich man in time -- and his being illiterate and coarse need not disturb _us_ ."" "" I wonder he did not remember the book ""-- was all Harriet ' s answer , and spoken with a degree of grave displeasure which Emma thought might be safely left to itself . She , therefore , said no more for some time . Her next beginning was , "" In one respect , perhaps , Mr . Elton ' s manners are superior to Mr . Knightley ' s or Mr . Weston ' s . They have more gentleness ."
austen#They might be more safely held up as a pattern . There is an openness , a quickness , almost a bluntness in Mr . Weston , which every body likes in _him_ , because there is so much good - humour with it -- but that would not do to be copied . Neither would Mr . Knightley ' s downright , decided , commanding sort of manner , though it suits _him_ very well ; his figure , and look , and situation in life seem to allow it ; but if any young man were to set about copying him , he would not be sufferable . On the contrary , I think a young man might be very safely recommended to take Mr . Elton as a model . Mr . Elton is good - humoured , cheerful , obliging , and gentle . He seems to me to be grown particularly gentle of late .
austen#"I do not know whether he has any design of ingratiating himself with either of us , Harriet , by additional softness , but it strikes me that his manners are softer than they used to be . If he means any thing , it must be to please you . Did not I tell you what he said of you the other day ?"" She then repeated some warm personal praise which she had drawn from Mr . Elton , and now did full justice to ; and Harriet blushed and smiled , and said she had always thought Mr . Elton very agreeable . Mr . Elton was the very person fixed on by Emma for driving the young farmer out of Harriet ' s head . She thought it would be an excellent match ; and only too palpably desirable , natural , and probable , for her to have much merit in planning it ."
austen#She feared it was what every body else must think of and predict . It was not likely , however , that any body should have equalled her in the date of the plan , as it had entered her brain during the very first evening of Harriet ' s coming to Hartfield . The longer she considered it , the greater was her sense of its expediency . Mr . Elton ' s situation was most suitable , quite the gentleman himself , and without low connexions ; at the same time , not of any family that could fairly object to the doubtful birth of Harriet . He had a comfortable home for her , and Emma imagined a very sufficient income ; for though the vicarage of Highbury was not large , he was known to have some independent property ; and she thought very highly of him as a good - humoured , well - meaning , respectable young man , without any deficiency of useful understanding or knowledge of the world . She had already satisfied herself that he thought Harriet a beautiful girl , which she trusted , with such frequent meetings at Hartfield , was foundation enough on his side ; and on Harriet ' s there could be little doubt that the idea of being preferred by him would have all the usual weight and efficacy .
austen#"And he was really a very pleasing young man , a young man whom any woman not fastidious might like . He was reckoned very handsome ; his person much admired in general , though not by her , there being a want of elegance of feature which she could not dispense with :-- but the girl who could be gratified by a Robert Martin ' s riding about the country to get walnuts for her might very well be conquered by Mr . Elton ' s admiration . CHAPTER V "" I do not know what your opinion may be , Mrs . Weston ,"" said Mr . Knightley , "" of this great intimacy between Emma and Harriet Smith , but I think it a bad thing ."" "" A bad thing ! Do you really think it a bad thing ?-- why so ?"""
austen#""" I think they will neither of them do the other any good ."" "" You surprize me ! Emma must do Harriet good : and by supplying her with a new object of interest , Harriet may be said to do Emma good . I have been seeing their intimacy with the greatest pleasure . How very differently we feel !-- Not think they will do each other any good ! This will certainly be the beginning of one of our quarrels about Emma , Mr ."
austen#"Knightley ."" "" Perhaps you think I am come on purpose to quarrel with you , knowing Weston to be out , and that you must still fight your own battle ."" "" Mr . Weston would undoubtedly support me , if he were here , for he thinks exactly as I do on the subject . We were speaking of it only yesterday , and agreeing how fortunate it was for Emma , that there should be such a girl in Highbury for her to associate with . Mr . Knightley , I shall not allow you to be a fair judge in this case . You are so much used to live alone , that you do not know the value of a companion ; and , perhaps no man can be a good judge of the comfort a woman feels in the society of one of her own sex , after being used to it all her life ."
austen#"I can imagine your objection to Harriet Smith . She is not the superior young woman which Emma ' s friend ought to be . But on the other hand , as Emma wants to see her better informed , it will be an inducement to her to read more herself . They will read together . She means it , I know ."" "" Emma has been meaning to read more ever since she was twelve years old ."
austen#"I have seen a great many lists of her drawing - up at various times of books that she meant to read regularly through -- and very good lists they were -- very well chosen , and very neatly arranged -- sometimes alphabetically , and sometimes by some other rule . The list she drew up when only fourteen -- I remember thinking it did her judgment so much credit , that I preserved it some time ; and I dare say she may have made out a very good list now . But I have done with expecting any course of steady reading from Emma . She will never submit to any thing requiring industry and patience , and a subjection of the fancy to the understanding . Where Miss Taylor failed to stimulate , I may safely affirm that Harriet Smith will do nothing .-- You never could persuade her to read half so much as you wished .-- You know you could not ."" "" I dare say ,"" replied Mrs . Weston , smiling , "" that I thought so _then_ ;-- but since we have parted , I can never remember Emma ' s omitting to do any thing I wished ."""
austen#""" There is hardly any desiring to refresh such a memory as _that_ ,""-- said Mr . Knightley , feelingly ; and for a moment or two he had done . "" But I ,"" he soon added , "" who have had no such charm thrown over my senses , must still see , hear , and remember . Emma is spoiled by being the cleverest of her family . At ten years old , she had the misfortune of being able to answer questions which puzzled her sister at seventeen . She was always quick and assured : Isabella slow and diffident . And ever since she was twelve , Emma has been mistress of the house and of you all ."
austen#"In her mother she lost the only person able to cope with her . She inherits her mother ' s talents , and must have been under subjection to her ."" "" I should have been sorry , Mr . Knightley , to be dependent on _your_ recommendation , had I quitted Mr . Woodhouse ' s family and wanted another situation ; I do not think you would have spoken a good word for me to any body . I am sure you always thought me unfit for the office I held ."" "" Yes ,"" said he , smiling . "" You are better placed _here_ ; very fit for a wife , but not at all for a governess ."
austen#"But you were preparing yourself to be an excellent wife all the time you were at Hartfield . You might not give Emma such a complete education as your powers would seem to promise ; but you were receiving a very good education from _her_ , on the very material matrimonial point of submitting your own will , and doing as you were bid ; and if Weston had asked me to recommend him a wife , I should certainly have named Miss Taylor ."" "" Thank you . There will be very little merit in making a good wife to such a man as Mr . Weston ."" "" Why , to own the truth , I am afraid you are rather thrown away , and that with every disposition to bear , there will be nothing to be borne ."
austen#"We will not despair , however . Weston may grow cross from the wantonness of comfort , or his son may plague him ."" "" I hope not _that_ .-- It is not likely . No , Mr . Knightley , do not foretell vexation from that quarter ."" "" Not I , indeed . I only name possibilities ."
austen#I do not pretend to Emma ' s genius for foretelling and guessing . I hope , with all my heart , the young man may be a Weston in merit , and a Churchill in fortune .-- But Harriet Smith -- I have not half done about Harriet Smith . I think her the very worst sort of companion that Emma could possibly have . She knows nothing herself , and looks upon Emma as knowing every thing . She is a flatterer in all her ways ; and so much the worse , because undesigned . Her ignorance is hourly flattery .
austen#"How can Emma imagine she has any thing to learn herself , while Harriet is presenting such a delightful inferiority ? And as for Harriet , I will venture to say that _she_ cannot gain by the acquaintance . Hartfield will only put her out of conceit with all the other places she belongs to . She will grow just refined enough to be uncomfortable with those among whom birth and circumstances have placed her home . I am much mistaken if Emma ' s doctrines give any strength of mind , or tend at all to make a girl adapt herself rationally to the varieties of her situation in life .-- They only give a little polish ."" "" I either depend more upon Emma ' s good sense than you do , or am more anxious for her present comfort ; for I cannot lament the acquaintance ."
austen#"How well she looked last night !"" "" Oh ! you would rather talk of her person than her mind , would you ? Very well ; I shall not attempt to deny Emma ' s being pretty ."" "" Pretty ! say beautiful rather ."
austen#"Can you imagine any thing nearer perfect beauty than Emma altogether -- face and figure ?"" "" I do not know what I could imagine , but I confess that I have seldom seen a face or figure more pleasing to me than hers . But I am a partial old friend ."" "" Such an eye !-- the true hazle eye -- and so brilliant ! regular features , open countenance , with a complexion ! oh !"
austen#"what a bloom of full health , and such a pretty height and size ; such a firm and upright figure ! There is health , not merely in her bloom , but in her air , her head , her glance . One hears sometimes of a child being ` the picture of health ;' now , Emma always gives me the idea of being the complete picture of grown - up health . She is loveliness itself . Mr . Knightley , is not she ?"" "" I have not a fault to find with her person ,"" he replied ."
austen#""" I think her all you describe . I love to look at her ; and I will add this praise , that I do not think her personally vain . Considering how very handsome she is , she appears to be little occupied with it ; her vanity lies another way . Mrs . Weston , I am not to be talked out of my dislike of Harriet Smith , or my dread of its doing them both harm ."" "" And I , Mr . Knightley , am equally stout in my confidence of its not doing them any harm . With all dear Emma ' s little faults , she is an excellent creature ."
austen#"Where shall we see a better daughter , or a kinder sister , or a truer friend ? No , no ; she has qualities which may be trusted ; she will never lead any one really wrong ; she will make no lasting blunder ; where Emma errs once , she is in the right a hundred times ."" "" Very well ; I will not plague you any more . Emma shall be an angel , and I will keep my spleen to myself till Christmas brings John and Isabella . John loves Emma with a reasonable and therefore not a blind affection , and Isabella always thinks as he does ; except when he is not quite frightened enough about the children . I am sure of having their opinions with me ."""
austen#""" I know that you all love her really too well to be unjust or unkind ; but excuse me , Mr . Knightley , if I take the liberty ( I consider myself , you know , as having somewhat of the privilege of speech that Emma ' s mother might have had ) the liberty of hinting that I do not think any possible good can arise from Harriet Smith ' s intimacy being made a matter of much discussion among you . Pray excuse me ; but supposing any little inconvenience may be apprehended from the intimacy , it cannot be expected that Emma , accountable to nobody but her father , who perfectly approves the acquaintance , should put an end to it , so long as it is a source of pleasure to herself . It has been so many years my province to give advice , that you cannot be surprized , Mr . Knightley , at this little remains of office ."" "" Not at all ,"" cried he ; "" I am much obliged to you for it . It is very good advice , and it shall have a better fate than your advice has often found ; for it shall be attended to ."" "" Mrs . John Knightley is easily alarmed , and might be made unhappy about her sister ."""
austen#""" Be satisfied ,"" said he , "" I will not raise any outcry . I will keep my ill - humour to myself . I have a very sincere interest in Emma . Isabella does not seem more my sister ; has never excited a greater interest ; perhaps hardly so great . There is an anxiety , a curiosity in what one feels for Emma . I wonder what will become of her !"""
austen#""" So do I ,"" said Mrs . Weston gently , "" very much ."" "" She always declares she will never marry , which , of course , means just nothing at all . But I have no idea that she has yet ever seen a man she cared for . It would not be a bad thing for her to be very much in love with a proper object . I should like to see Emma in love , and in some doubt of a return ; it would do her good . But there is nobody hereabouts to attach her ; and she goes so seldom from home ."""
austen#""" There does , indeed , seem as little to tempt her to break her resolution at present ,"" said Mrs . Weston , "" as can well be ; and while she is so happy at Hartfield , I cannot wish her to be forming any attachment which would be creating such difficulties on poor Mr . Woodhouse ' s account . I do not recommend matrimony at present to Emma , though I mean no slight to the state , I assure you ."" Part of her meaning was to conceal some favourite thoughts of her own and Mr . Weston ' s on the subject , as much as possible . There were wishes at Randalls respecting Emma ' s destiny , but it was not desirable to have them suspected ; and the quiet transition which Mr . Knightley soon afterwards made to "" What does Weston think of the weather ; shall we have rain ?"" convinced her that he had nothing more to say or surmise about Hartfield . CHAPTER VI"
austen#"Emma could not feel a doubt of having given Harriet ' s fancy a proper direction and raised the gratitude of her young vanity to a very good purpose , for she found her decidedly more sensible than before of Mr . Elton ' s being a remarkably handsome man , with most agreeable manners ; and as she had no hesitation in following up the assurance of his admiration by agreeable hints , she was soon pretty confident of creating as much liking on Harriet ' s side , as there could be any occasion for . She was quite convinced of Mr . Elton ' s being in the fairest way of falling in love , if not in love already . She had no scruple with regard to him . He talked of Harriet , and praised her so warmly , that she could not suppose any thing wanting which a little time would not add . His perception of the striking improvement of Harriet ' s manner , since her introduction at Hartfield , was not one of the least agreeable proofs of his growing attachment . "" You have given Miss Smith all that she required ,"" said he ; "" you have made her graceful and easy ."
austen#"She was a beautiful creature when she came to you , but , in my opinion , the attractions you have added are infinitely superior to what she received from nature ."" "" I am glad you think I have been useful to her ; but Harriet only wanted drawing out , and receiving a few , very few hints . She had all the natural grace of sweetness of temper and artlessness in herself . I have done very little ."" "" If it were admissible to contradict a lady ,"" said the gallant Mr . Elton -- "" I have perhaps given her a little more decision of character , have taught her to think on points which had not fallen in her way before ."""
austen#""" Exactly so ; that is what principally strikes me . So much superadded decision of character ! Skilful has been the hand !"" "" Great has been the pleasure , I am sure . I never met with a disposition more truly amiable ."" "" I have no doubt of it ."""
austen#"And it was spoken with a sort of sighing animation , which had a vast deal of the lover . She was not less pleased another day with the manner in which he seconded a sudden wish of hers , to have Harriet ' s picture . "" Did you ever have your likeness taken , Harriet ?"" said she : "" did you ever sit for your picture ?"" Harriet was on the point of leaving the room , and only stopt to say , with a very interesting naivete , "" Oh !"
austen#"dear , no , never ."" No sooner was she out of sight , than Emma exclaimed , "" What an exquisite possession a good picture of her would be ! I would give any money for it . I almost long to attempt her likeness myself . You do not know it I dare say , but two or three years ago I had a great passion for taking likenesses , and attempted several of my friends , and was thought to have a tolerable eye in general ."
austen#"But from one cause or another , I gave it up in disgust . But really , I could almost venture , if Harriet would sit to me . It would be such a delight to have her picture !"" "" Let me entreat you ,"" cried Mr . Elton ; "" it would indeed be a delight ! Let me entreat you , Miss Woodhouse , to exercise so charming a talent in favour of your friend . I know what your drawings are ."
austen#"How could you suppose me ignorant ? Is not this room rich in specimens of your landscapes and flowers ; and has not Mrs . Weston some inimitable figure - pieces in her drawing - room , at Randalls ?"" Yes , good man !-- thought Emma -- but what has all that to do with taking likenesses ? You know nothing of drawing . Don ' t pretend to be in raptures about mine . Keep your raptures for Harriet ' s face ."
austen#""" Well , if you give me such kind encouragement , Mr . Elton , I believe I shall try what I can do . Harriet ' s features are very delicate , which makes a likeness difficult ; and yet there is a peculiarity in the shape of the eye and the lines about the mouth which one ought to catch ."" "" Exactly so -- The shape of the eye and the lines about the mouth -- I have not a doubt of your success . Pray , pray attempt it . As you will do it , it will indeed , to use your own words , be an exquisite possession ."" "" But I am afraid , Mr . Elton , Harriet will not like to sit ."
austen#"She thinks so little of her own beauty . Did not you observe her manner of answering me ? How completely it meant , ` why should my picture be drawn ?'"" "" Oh ! yes , I observed it , I assure you . It was not lost on me ."
austen#"But still I cannot imagine she would not be persuaded ."" Harriet was soon back again , and the proposal almost immediately made ; and she had no scruples which could stand many minutes against the earnest pressing of both the others . Emma wished to go to work directly , and therefore produced the portfolio containing her various attempts at portraits , for not one of them had ever been finished , that they might decide together on the best size for Harriet . Her many beginnings were displayed . Miniatures , half - lengths , whole - lengths , pencil , crayon , and water - colours had been all tried in turn . She had always wanted to do every thing , and had made more progress both in drawing and music than many might have done with so little labour as she would ever submit to ."
austen#"She played and sang ;-- and drew in almost every style ; but steadiness had always been wanting ; and in nothing had she approached the degree of excellence which she would have been glad to command , and ought not to have failed of . She was not much deceived as to her own skill either as an artist or a musician , but she was not unwilling to have others deceived , or sorry to know her reputation for accomplishment often higher than it deserved . There was merit in every drawing -- in the least finished , perhaps the most ; her style was spirited ; but had there been much less , or had there been ten times more , the delight and admiration of her two companions would have been the same . They were both in ecstasies . A likeness pleases every body ; and Miss Woodhouse ' s performances must be capital . "" No great variety of faces for you ,"" said Emma ."
austen#""" I had only my own family to study from . There is my father -- another of my father -- but the idea of sitting for his picture made him so nervous , that I could only take him by stealth ; neither of them very like therefore . Mrs . Weston again , and again , and again , you see . Dear Mrs . Weston ! always my kindest friend on every occasion . She would sit whenever I asked her ."
austen#There is my sister ; and really quite her own little elegant figure !-- and the face not unlike . I should have made a good likeness of her , if she would have sat longer , but she was in such a hurry to have me draw her four children that she would not be quiet . Then , here come all my attempts at three of those four children ;-- there they are , Henry and John and Bella , from one end of the sheet to the other , and any one of them might do for any one of the rest . She was so eager to have them drawn that I could not refuse ; but there is no making children of three or four years old stand still you know ; nor can it be very easy to take any likeness of them , beyond the air and complexion , unless they are coarser featured than any of mama ' s children ever were . Here is my sketch of the fourth , who was a baby . I took him as he was sleeping on the sofa , and it is as strong a likeness of his cockade as you would wish to see .
austen#"He had nestled down his head most conveniently . That ' s very like . I am rather proud of little George . The corner of the sofa is very good . Then here is my last ,""-- unclosing a pretty sketch of a gentleman in small size , whole - length --"" my last and my best -- my brother , Mr . John Knightley .-- This did not want much of being finished , when I put it away in a pet , and vowed I would never take another likeness . I could not help being provoked ; for after all my pains , and when I had really made a very good likeness of it --( Mrs . Weston and I were quite agreed in thinking it _very_ like )-- only too handsome -- too flattering -- but that was a fault on the right side -- after all this , came poor dear Isabella ' s cold approbation of --"" Yes , it was a little like -- but to be sure it did not do him justice ."""
austen#"We had had a great deal of trouble in persuading him to sit at all . It was made a great favour of ; and altogether it was more than I could bear ; and so I never would finish it , to have it apologised over as an unfavourable likeness , to every morning visitor in Brunswick Square ;-- and , as I said , I did then forswear ever drawing any body again . But for Harriet ' s sake , or rather for my own , and as there are no husbands and wives in the case _at_ _present_ , I will break my resolution now ."" Mr . Elton seemed very properly struck and delighted by the idea , and was repeating , "" No husbands and wives in the case at present indeed , as you observe . Exactly so . No husbands and wives ,"" with so interesting a consciousness , that Emma began to consider whether she had not better leave them together at once ."
austen#But as she wanted to be drawing , the declaration must wait a little longer . She had soon fixed on the size and sort of portrait . It was to be a whole - length in water - colours , like Mr . John Knightley ' s , and was destined , if she could please herself , to hold a very honourable station over the mantelpiece . The sitting began ; and Harriet , smiling and blushing , and afraid of not keeping her attitude and countenance , presented a very sweet mixture of youthful expression to the steady eyes of the artist . But there was no doing any thing , with Mr . Elton fidgeting behind her and watching every touch . She gave him credit for stationing himself where he might gaze and gaze again without offence ; but was really obliged to put an end to it , and request him to place himself elsewhere .
austen#"It then occurred to her to employ him in reading . "" If he would be so good as to read to them , it would be a kindness indeed ! It would amuse away the difficulties of her part , and lessen the irksomeness of Miss Smith ' s ."" Mr . Elton was only too happy . Harriet listened , and Emma drew in peace . She must allow him to be still frequently coming to look ; any thing less would certainly have been too little in a lover ; and he was ready at the smallest intermission of the pencil , to jump up and see the progress , and be charmed .-- There was no being displeased with such an encourager , for his admiration made him discern a likeness almost before it was possible ."
austen#"She could not respect his eye , but his love and his complaisance were unexceptionable . The sitting was altogether very satisfactory ; she was quite enough pleased with the first day ' s sketch to wish to go on . There was no want of likeness , she had been fortunate in the attitude , and as she meant to throw in a little improvement to the figure , to give a little more height , and considerably more elegance , she had great confidence of its being in every way a pretty drawing at last , and of its filling its destined place with credit to them both -- a standing memorial of the beauty of one , the skill of the other , and the friendship of both ; with as many other agreeable associations as Mr . Elton ' s very promising attachment was likely to add . Harriet was to sit again the next day ; and Mr . Elton , just as he ought , entreated for the permission of attending and reading to them again . "" By all means . We shall be most happy to consider you as one of the party ."""
austen#"The same civilities and courtesies , the same success and satisfaction , took place on the morrow , and accompanied the whole progress of the picture , which was rapid and happy . Every body who saw it was pleased , but Mr . Elton was in continual raptures , and defended it through every criticism . "" Miss Woodhouse has given her friend the only beauty she wanted ,""-- observed Mrs . Weston to him -- not in the least suspecting that she was addressing a lover .--"" The expression of the eye is most correct , but Miss Smith has not those eyebrows and eyelashes . It is the fault of her face that she has them not ."" "" Do you think so ?"" replied he ."
austen#""" I cannot agree with you . It appears to me a most perfect resemblance in every feature . I never saw such a likeness in my life . We must allow for the effect of shade , you know ."" "" You have made her too tall , Emma ,"" said Mr . Knightley . Emma knew that she had , but would not own it ; and Mr . Elton warmly added ,"
austen#""" Oh no ! certainly not too tall ; not in the least too tall . Consider , she is sitting down -- which naturally presents a different -- which in short gives exactly the idea -- and the proportions must be preserved , you know . Proportions , fore - shortening .-- Oh no ! it gives one exactly the idea of such a height as Miss Smith ' s . Exactly so indeed !"""
austen#""" It is very pretty ,"" said Mr . Woodhouse . "" So prettily done ! Just as your drawings always are , my dear . I do not know any body who draws so well as you do . The only thing I do not thoroughly like is , that she seems to be sitting out of doors , with only a little shawl over her shoulders -- and it makes one think she must catch cold ."" "" But , my dear papa , it is supposed to be summer ; a warm day in summer ."
austen#"Look at the tree ."" "" But it is never safe to sit out of doors , my dear ."" "" You , sir , may say any thing ,"" cried Mr . Elton , "" but I must confess that I regard it as a most happy thought , the placing of Miss Smith out of doors ; and the tree is touched with such inimitable spirit ! Any other situation would have been much less in character . The naivete of Miss Smith ' s manners -- and altogether -- Oh , it is most admirable ! I cannot keep my eyes from it ."
austen#"I never saw such a likeness ."" The next thing wanted was to get the picture framed ; and here were a few difficulties . It must be done directly ; it must be done in London ; the order must go through the hands of some intelligent person whose taste could be depended on ; and Isabella , the usual doer of all commissions , must not be applied to , because it was December , and Mr . Woodhouse could not bear the idea of her stirring out of her house in the fogs of December . But no sooner was the distress known to Mr . Elton , than it was removed . His gallantry was always on the alert . "" Might he be trusted with the commission , what infinite pleasure should he have in executing it !"
austen#"he could ride to London at any time . It was impossible to say how much he should be gratified by being employed on such an errand ."" "" He was too good !-- she could not endure the thought !-- she would not give him such a troublesome office for the world ,""-- brought on the desired repetition of entreaties and assurances ,-- and a very few minutes settled the business . Mr . Elton was to take the drawing to London , chuse the frame , and give the directions ; and Emma thought she could so pack it as to ensure its safety without much incommoding him , while he seemed mostly fearful of not being incommoded enough . "" What a precious deposit !"" said he with a tender sigh , as he received it ."
austen#""" This man is almost too gallant to be in love ,"" thought Emma . "" I should say so , but that I suppose there may be a hundred different ways of being in love . He is an excellent young man , and will suit Harriet exactly ; it will be an ` Exactly so ,' as he says himself ; but he does sigh and languish , and study for compliments rather more than I could endure as a principal . I come in for a pretty good share as a second . But it is his gratitude on Harriet ' s account ."" CHAPTER VII"
austen#"The very day of Mr . Elton ' s going to London produced a fresh occasion for Emma ' s services towards her friend . Harriet had been at Hartfield , as usual , soon after breakfast ; and , after a time , had gone home to return again to dinner : she returned , and sooner than had been talked of , and with an agitated , hurried look , announcing something extraordinary to have happened which she was longing to tell . Half a minute brought it all out . She had heard , as soon as she got back to Mrs . Goddard ' s , that Mr . Martin had been there an hour before , and finding she was not at home , nor particularly expected , had left a little parcel for her from one of his sisters , and gone away ; and on opening this parcel , she had actually found , besides the two songs which she had lent Elizabeth to copy , a letter to herself ; and this letter was from him , from Mr . Martin , and contained a direct proposal of marriage . "" Who could have thought it ? She was so surprized she did not know what to do ."
austen#"Yes , quite a proposal of marriage ; and a very good letter , at least she thought so . And he wrote as if he really loved her very much -- but she did not know -- and so , she was come as fast as she could to ask Miss Woodhouse what she should do .--"" Emma was half - ashamed of her friend for seeming so pleased and so doubtful . "" Upon my word ,"" she cried , "" the young man is determined not to lose any thing for want of asking . He will connect himself well if he can ."" "" Will you read the letter ?"" cried Harriet ."
austen#""" Pray do . I ' d rather you would ."" Emma was not sorry to be pressed . She read , and was surprized . The style of the letter was much above her expectation . There were not merely no grammatical errors , but as a composition it would not have disgraced a gentleman ; the language , though plain , was strong and unaffected , and the sentiments it conveyed very much to the credit of the writer ."
austen#"It was short , but expressed good sense , warm attachment , liberality , propriety , even delicacy of feeling . She paused over it , while Harriet stood anxiously watching for her opinion , with a "" Well , well ,"" and was at last forced to add , "" Is it a good letter ? or is it too short ?"" "" Yes , indeed , a very good letter ,"" replied Emma rather slowly --"" so good a letter , Harriet , that every thing considered , I think one of his sisters must have helped him . I can hardly imagine the young man whom I saw talking with you the other day could express himself so well , if left quite to his own powers , and yet it is not the style of a woman ; no , certainly , it is too strong and concise ; not diffuse enough for a woman . No doubt he is a sensible man , and I suppose may have a natural talent for -- thinks strongly and clearly -- and when he takes a pen in hand , his thoughts naturally find proper words ."
austen#"It is so with some men . Yes , I understand the sort of mind . Vigorous , decided , with sentiments to a certain point , not coarse . A better written letter , Harriet ( returning it ,) than I had expected ."" "" Well ,"" said the still waiting Harriet ;--"" well -- and -- and what shall I do ?"" "" What shall you do !"
austen#"In what respect ? Do you mean with regard to this letter ?"" "" Yes ."" "" But what are you in doubt of ? You must answer it of course -- and speedily ."" "" Yes ."
austen#"But what shall I say ? Dear Miss Woodhouse , do advise me ."" "" Oh no , no ! the letter had much better be all your own . You will express yourself very properly , I am sure . There is no danger of your not being intelligible , which is the first thing ."
austen#"Your meaning must be unequivocal ; no doubts or demurs : and such expressions of gratitude and concern for the pain you are inflicting as propriety requires , will present themselves unbidden to _your_ mind , I am persuaded . You need not be prompted to write with the appearance of sorrow for his disappointment ."" "" You think I ought to refuse him then ,"" said Harriet , looking down . "" Ought to refuse him ! My dear Harriet , what do you mean ? Are you in any doubt as to that ?"
austen#"I thought -- but I beg your pardon , perhaps I have been under a mistake . I certainly have been misunderstanding you , if you feel in doubt as to the _purport_ of your answer . I had imagined you were consulting me only as to the wording of it ."" Harriet was silent . With a little reserve of manner , Emma continued : "" You mean to return a favourable answer , I collect ."""
austen#""" No , I do not ; that is , I do not mean -- What shall I do ? What would you advise me to do ? Pray , dear Miss Woodhouse , tell me what I ought to do ."" "" I shall not give you any advice , Harriet . I will have nothing to do with it . This is a point which you must settle with your feelings ."""
austen#""" I had no notion that he liked me so very much ,"" said Harriet , contemplating the letter . For a little while Emma persevered in her silence ; but beginning to apprehend the bewitching flattery of that letter might be too powerful , she thought it best to say , "" I lay it down as a general rule , Harriet , that if a woman _doubts_ as to whether she should accept a man or not , she certainly ought to refuse him . If she can hesitate as to ` Yes ,' she ought to say ` No ' directly . It is not a state to be safely entered into with doubtful feelings , with half a heart . I thought it my duty as a friend , and older than yourself , to say thus much to you ."
austen#"But do not imagine that I want to influence you ."" "" Oh ! no , I am sure you are a great deal too kind to -- but if you would just advise me what I had best do -- No , no , I do not mean that -- As you say , one ' s mind ought to be quite made up -- One should not be hesitating -- It is a very serious thing .-- It will be safer to say ` No ,' perhaps .-- Do you think I had better say ` No ?'"" "" Not for the world ,"" said Emma , smiling graciously , "" would I advise you either way . You must be the best judge of your own happiness . If you prefer Mr . Martin to every other person ; if you think him the most agreeable man you have ever been in company with , why should you hesitate ?"
austen#"You blush , Harriet .-- Does any body else occur to you at this moment under such a definition ? Harriet , Harriet , do not deceive yourself ; do not be run away with by gratitude and compassion . At this moment whom are you thinking of ?"" The symptoms were favourable .-- Instead of answering , Harriet turned away confused , and stood thoughtfully by the fire ; and though the letter was still in her hand , it was now mechanically twisted about without regard . Emma waited the result with impatience , but not without strong hopes . At last , with some hesitation , Harriet said --"
austen#""" Miss Woodhouse , as you will not give me your opinion , I must do as well as I can by myself ; and I have now quite determined , and really almost made up my mind -- to refuse Mr . Martin . Do you think I am right ?"" "" Perfectly , perfectly right , my dearest Harriet ; you are doing just what you ought . While you were at all in suspense I kept my feelings to myself , but now that you are so completely decided I have no hesitation in approving . Dear Harriet , I give myself joy of this . It would have grieved me to lose your acquaintance , which must have been the consequence of your marrying Mr . Martin ."
austen#"While you were in the smallest degree wavering , I said nothing about it , because I would not influence ; but it would have been the loss of a friend to me . I could not have visited Mrs . Robert Martin , of Abbey - Mill Farm . Now I am secure of you for ever ."" Harriet had not surmised her own danger , but the idea of it struck her forcibly . "" You could not have visited me !"" she cried , looking aghast ."
austen#""" No , to be sure you could not ; but I never thought of that before . That would have been too dreadful !-- What an escape !-- Dear Miss Woodhouse , I would not give up the pleasure and honour of being intimate with you for any thing in the world ."" "" Indeed , Harriet , it would have been a severe pang to lose you ; but it must have been . You would have thrown yourself out of all good society . I must have given you up ."" "" Dear me !-- How should I ever have borne it !"
austen#"It would have killed me never to come to Hartfield any more !"" "" Dear affectionate creature !-- _You_ banished to Abbey - Mill Farm !-- _You_ confined to the society of the illiterate and vulgar all your life ! I wonder how the young man could have the assurance to ask it . He must have a pretty good opinion of himself ."" "" I do not think he is conceited either , in general ,"" said Harriet , her conscience opposing such censure ; "" at least , he is very good natured , and I shall always feel much obliged to him , and have a great regard for -- but that is quite a different thing from -- and you know , though he may like me , it does not follow that I should -- and certainly I must confess that since my visiting here I have seen people -- and if one comes to compare them , person and manners , there is no comparison at all , _one_ is so very handsome and agreeable . However , I do really think Mr . Martin a very amiable young man , and have a great opinion of him ; and his being so much attached to me -- and his writing such a letter -- but as to leaving you , it is what I would not do upon any consideration ."""
austen#""" Thank you , thank you , my own sweet little friend . We will not be parted . A woman is not to marry a man merely because she is asked , or because he is attached to her , and can write a tolerable letter ."" "" Oh no ;-- and it is but a short letter too ."" Emma felt the bad taste of her friend , but let it pass with a "" very true ; and it would be a small consolation to her , for the clownish manner which might be offending her every hour of the day , to know that her husband could write a good letter ."" "" Oh !"
austen#"yes , very . Nobody cares for a letter ; the thing is , to be always happy with pleasant companions . I am quite determined to refuse him . But how shall I do ? What shall I say ?"" Emma assured her there would be no difficulty in the answer , and advised its being written directly , which was agreed to , in the hope of her assistance ; and though Emma continued to protest against any assistance being wanted , it was in fact given in the formation of every sentence ."
austen#"The looking over his letter again , in replying to it , had such a softening tendency , that it was particularly necessary to brace her up with a few decisive expressions ; and she was so very much concerned at the idea of making him unhappy , and thought so much of what his mother and sisters would think and say , and was so anxious that they should not fancy her ungrateful , that Emma believed if the young man had come in her way at that moment , he would have been accepted after all . This letter , however , was written , and sealed , and sent . The business was finished , and Harriet safe . She was rather low all the evening , but Emma could allow for her amiable regrets , and sometimes relieved them by speaking of her own affection , sometimes by bringing forward the idea of Mr . Elton . "" I shall never be invited to Abbey - Mill again ,"" was said in rather a sorrowful tone . "" Nor , if you were , could I ever bear to part with you , my Harriet ."
austen#"You are a great deal too necessary at Hartfield to be spared to Abbey - Mill ."" "" And I am sure I should never want to go there ; for I am never happy but at Hartfield ."" Some time afterwards it was , "" I think Mrs . Goddard would be very much surprized if she knew what had happened . I am sure Miss Nash would -- for Miss Nash thinks her own sister very well married , and it is only a linen - draper ."" "" One should be sorry to see greater pride or refinement in the teacher of a school , Harriet . I dare say Miss Nash would envy you such an opportunity as this of being married ."
austen#"Even this conquest would appear valuable in her eyes . As to any thing superior for you , I suppose she is quite in the dark . The attentions of a certain person can hardly be among the tittle - tattle of Highbury yet . Hitherto I fancy you and I are the only people to whom his looks and manners have explained themselves ."" Harriet blushed and smiled , and said something about wondering that people should like her so much . The idea of Mr . Elton was certainly cheering ; but still , after a time , she was tender - hearted again towards the rejected Mr . Martin ."
austen#""" Now he has got my letter ,"" said she softly . "" I wonder what they are all doing -- whether his sisters know -- if he is unhappy , they will be unhappy too . I hope he will not mind it so very much ."" "" Let us think of those among our absent friends who are more cheerfully employed ,"" cried Emma . "" At this moment , perhaps , Mr . Elton is shewing your picture to his mother and sisters , telling how much more beautiful is the original , and after being asked for it five or six times , allowing them to hear your name , your own dear name ."" "" My picture !-- But he has left my picture in Bond - street ."""
austen#""" Has he so !-- Then I know nothing of Mr . Elton . No , my dear little modest Harriet , depend upon it the picture will not be in Bond - street till just before he mounts his horse to - morrow . It is his companion all this evening , his solace , his delight . It opens his designs to his family , it introduces you among them , it diffuses through the party those pleasantest feelings of our nature , eager curiosity and warm prepossession . How cheerful , how animated , how suspicious , how busy their imaginations all are !"" Harriet smiled again , and her smiles grew stronger ."
austen#CHAPTER VIII Harriet slept at Hartfield that night . For some weeks past she had been spending more than half her time there , and gradually getting to have a bed - room appropriated to herself ; and Emma judged it best in every respect , safest and kindest , to keep her with them as much as possible just at present . She was obliged to go the next morning for an hour or two to Mrs . Goddard ' s , but it was then to be settled that she should return to Hartfield , to make a regular visit of some days . While she was gone , Mr . Knightley called , and sat some time with Mr . Woodhouse and Emma , till Mr . Woodhouse , who had previously made up his mind to walk out , was persuaded by his daughter not to defer it , and was induced by the entreaties of both , though against the scruples of his own civility , to leave Mr . Knightley for that purpose . Mr . Knightley , who had nothing of ceremony about him , was offering by his short , decided answers , an amusing contrast to the protracted apologies and civil hesitations of the other .
austen#""" Well , I believe , if you will excuse me , Mr . Knightley , if you will not consider me as doing a very rude thing , I shall take Emma ' s advice and go out for a quarter of an hour . As the sun is out , I believe I had better take my three turns while I can . I treat you without ceremony , Mr . Knightley . We invalids think we are privileged people ."" "" My dear sir , do not make a stranger of me ."" "" I leave an excellent substitute in my daughter ."
austen#"Emma will be happy to entertain you . And therefore I think I will beg your excuse and take my three turns -- my winter walk ."" "" You cannot do better , sir ."" "" I would ask for the pleasure of your company , Mr . Knightley , but I am a very slow walker , and my pace would be tedious to you ; and , besides , you have another long walk before you , to Donwell Abbey ."" "" Thank you , sir , thank you ; I am going this moment myself ; and I think the sooner _you_ go the better . I will fetch your greatcoat and open the garden door for you ."""
austen#"Mr . Woodhouse at last was off ; but Mr . Knightley , instead of being immediately off likewise , sat down again , seemingly inclined for more chat . He began speaking of Harriet , and speaking of her with more voluntary praise than Emma had ever heard before . "" I cannot rate her beauty as you do ,"" said he ; "" but she is a pretty little creature , and I am inclined to think very well of her disposition . Her character depends upon those she is with ; but in good hands she will turn out a valuable woman ."" "" I am glad you think so ; and the good hands , I hope , may not be wanting ."" "" Come ,"" said he , "" you are anxious for a compliment , so I will tell you that you have improved her ."
austen#"You have cured her of her school - girl ' s giggle ; she really does you credit ."" "" Thank you . I should be mortified indeed if I did not believe I had been of some use ; but it is not every body who will bestow praise where they may . _You_ do not often overpower me with it ."" "" You are expecting her again , you say , this morning ?"" "" Almost every moment ."
austen#"She has been gone longer already than she intended ."" "" Something has happened to delay her ; some visitors perhaps ."" "" Highbury gossips !-- Tiresome wretches !"" "" Harriet may not consider every body tiresome that you would ."" Emma knew this was too true for contradiction , and therefore said nothing . He presently added , with a smile ,"
austen#""" I do not pretend to fix on times or places , but I must tell you that I have good reason to believe your little friend will soon hear of something to her advantage ."" "" Indeed ! how so ? of what sort ?"" "" A very serious sort , I assure you ;"" still smiling . "" Very serious !"
austen#"I can think of but one thing -- Who is in love with her ? Who makes you their confidant ?"" Emma was more than half in hopes of Mr . Elton ' s having dropt a hint . Mr . Knightley was a sort of general friend and adviser , and she knew Mr . Elton looked up to him . "" I have reason to think ,"" he replied , "" that Harriet Smith will soon have an offer of marriage , and from a most unexceptionable quarter :-- Robert Martin is the man . Her visit to Abbey - Mill , this summer , seems to have done his business ."
austen#"He is desperately in love and means to marry her ."" "" He is very obliging ,"" said Emma ; "" but is he sure that Harriet means to marry him ?"" "" Well , well , means to make her an offer then . Will that do ? He came to the Abbey two evenings ago , on purpose to consult me about it . He knows I have a thorough regard for him and all his family , and , I believe , considers me as one of his best friends ."
austen#He came to ask me whether I thought it would be imprudent in him to settle so early ; whether I thought her too young : in short , whether I approved his choice altogether ; having some apprehension perhaps of her being considered ( especially since _your_ making so much of her ) as in a line of society above him . I was very much pleased with all that he said . I never hear better sense from any one than Robert Martin . He always speaks to the purpose ; open , straightforward , and very well judging . He told me every thing ; his circumstances and plans , and what they all proposed doing in the event of his marriage . He is an excellent young man , both as son and brother .
austen#"I had no hesitation in advising him to marry . He proved to me that he could afford it ; and that being the case , I was convinced he could not do better . I praised the fair lady too , and altogether sent him away very happy . If he had never esteemed my opinion before , he would have thought highly of me then ; and , I dare say , left the house thinking me the best friend and counsellor man ever had . This happened the night before last . Now , as we may fairly suppose , he would not allow much time to pass before he spoke to the lady , and as he does not appear to have spoken yesterday , it is not unlikely that he should be at Mrs . Goddard ' s to - day ; and she may be detained by a visitor , without thinking him at all a tiresome wretch ."""
austen#""" Pray , Mr . Knightley ,"" said Emma , who had been smiling to herself through a great part of this speech , "" how do you know that Mr . Martin did not speak yesterday ?"" "" Certainly ,"" replied he , surprized , "" I do not absolutely know it ; but it may be inferred . Was not she the whole day with you ?"" "" Come ,"" said she , "" I will tell you something , in return for what you have told me . He did speak yesterday -- that is , he wrote , and was refused ."" This was obliged to be repeated before it could be believed ; and Mr . Knightley actually looked red with surprize and displeasure , as he stood up , in tall indignation , and said ,"
austen#""" Then she is a greater simpleton than I ever believed her . What is the foolish girl about ?"" "" Oh ! to be sure ,"" cried Emma , "" it is always incomprehensible to a man that a woman should ever refuse an offer of marriage . A man always imagines a woman to be ready for any body who asks her ."" "" Nonsense !"
austen#"a man does not imagine any such thing . But what is the meaning of this ? Harriet Smith refuse Robert Martin ? madness , if it is so ; but I hope you are mistaken ."" "" I saw her answer !-- nothing could be clearer ."" "" You saw her answer !-- you wrote her answer too ."
austen#"Emma , this is your doing . You persuaded her to refuse him ."" "" And if I did , ( which , however , I am far from allowing ) I should not feel that I had done wrong . Mr . Martin is a very respectable young man , but I cannot admit him to be Harriet ' s equal ; and am rather surprized indeed that he should have ventured to address her . By your account , he does seem to have had some scruples . It is a pity that they were ever got over ."""
austen#""" Not Harriet ' s equal !"" exclaimed Mr . Knightley loudly and warmly ; and with calmer asperity , added , a few moments afterwards , "" No , he is not her equal indeed , for he is as much her superior in sense as in situation . Emma , your infatuation about that girl blinds you . What are Harriet Smith ' s claims , either of birth , nature or education , to any connexion higher than Robert Martin ? She is the natural daughter of nobody knows whom , with probably no settled provision at all , and certainly no respectable relations . She is known only as parlour - boarder at a common school ."
austen#She is not a sensible girl , nor a girl of any information . She has been taught nothing useful , and is too young and too simple to have acquired any thing herself . At her age she can have no experience , and with her little wit , is not very likely ever to have any that can avail her . She is pretty , and she is good tempered , and that is all . My only scruple in advising the match was on his account , as being beneath his deserts , and a bad connexion for him . I felt that , as to fortune , in all probability he might do much better ; and that as to a rational companion or useful helpmate , he could not do worse .
austen#"But I could not reason so to a man in love , and was willing to trust to there being no harm in her , to her having that sort of disposition , which , in good hands , like his , might be easily led aright and turn out very well . The advantage of the match I felt to be all on her side ; and had not the smallest doubt ( nor have I now ) that there would be a general cry - out upon her extreme good luck . Even _your_ satisfaction I made sure of . It crossed my mind immediately that you would not regret your friend ' s leaving Highbury , for the sake of her being settled so well . I remember saying to myself , ` Even Emma , with all her partiality for Harriet , will think this a good match .'"" "" I cannot help wondering at your knowing so little of Emma as to say any such thing ."
austen#What ! think a farmer , ( and with all his sense and all his merit Mr . Martin is nothing more ,) a good match for my intimate friend ! Not regret her leaving Highbury for the sake of marrying a man whom I could never admit as an acquaintance of my own ! I wonder you should think it possible for me to have such feelings . I assure you mine are very different . I must think your statement by no means fair .
austen#"You are not just to Harriet ' s claims . They would be estimated very differently by others as well as myself ; Mr . Martin may be the richest of the two , but he is undoubtedly her inferior as to rank in society .-- The sphere in which she moves is much above his .-- It would be a degradation ."" "" A degradation to illegitimacy and ignorance , to be married to a respectable , intelligent gentleman - farmer !"" "" As to the circumstances of her birth , though in a legal sense she may be called Nobody , it will not hold in common sense . She is not to pay for the offence of others , by being held below the level of those with whom she is brought up .-- There can scarcely be a doubt that her father is a gentleman -- and a gentleman of fortune .-- Her allowance is very liberal ; nothing has ever been grudged for her improvement or comfort .-- That she is a gentleman ' s daughter , is indubitable to me ; that she associates with gentlemen ' s daughters , no one , I apprehend , will deny .-- She is superior to Mr . Robert Martin ."" "" Whoever might be her parents ,"" said Mr . Knightley , "" whoever may have had the charge of her , it does not appear to have been any part of their plan to introduce her into what you would call good society ."
austen#After receiving a very indifferent education she is left in Mrs . Goddard ' s hands to shift as she can ;-- to move , in short , in Mrs . Goddard ' s line , to have Mrs . Goddard ' s acquaintance . Her friends evidently thought this good enough for her ; and it _was_ good enough . She desired nothing better herself . Till you chose to turn her into a friend , her mind had no distaste for her own set , nor any ambition beyond it . She was as happy as possible with the Martins in the summer . She had no sense of superiority then .
austen#If she has it now , you have given it . You have been no friend to Harriet Smith , Emma . Robert Martin would never have proceeded so far , if he had not felt persuaded of her not being disinclined to him . I know him well . He has too much real feeling to address any woman on the haphazard of selfish passion . And as to conceit , he is the farthest from it of any man I know .
austen#"Depend upon it he had encouragement ."" It was most convenient to Emma not to make a direct reply to this assertion ; she chose rather to take up her own line of the subject again . "" You are a very warm friend to Mr . Martin ; but , as I said before , are unjust to Harriet . Harriet ' s claims to marry well are not so contemptible as you represent them . She is not a clever girl , but she has better sense than you are aware of , and does not deserve to have her understanding spoken of so slightingly . Waiving that point , however , and supposing her to be , as you describe her , only pretty and good - natured , let me tell you , that in the degree she possesses them , they are not trivial recommendations to the world in general , for she is , in fact , a beautiful girl , and must be thought so by ninety - nine people out of an hundred ; and till it appears that men are much more philosophic on the subject of beauty than they are generally supposed ; till they do fall in love with well - informed minds instead of handsome faces , a girl , with such loveliness as Harriet , has a certainty of being admired and sought after , of having the power of chusing from among many , consequently a claim to be nice ."
austen#"Her good - nature , too , is not so very slight a claim , comprehending , as it does , real , thorough sweetness of temper and manner , a very humble opinion of herself , and a great readiness to be pleased with other people . I am very much mistaken if your sex in general would not think such beauty , and such temper , the highest claims a woman could possess ."" "" Upon my word , Emma , to hear you abusing the reason you have , is almost enough to make me think so too . Better be without sense , than misapply it as you do ."" "" To be sure !"" cried she playfully ."
austen#""" I know _that_ is the feeling of you all . I know that such a girl as Harriet is exactly what every man delights in -- what at once bewitches his senses and satisfies his judgment . Oh ! Harriet may pick and chuse . Were you , yourself , ever to marry , she is the very woman for you . And is she , at seventeen , just entering into life , just beginning to be known , to be wondered at because she does not accept the first offer she receives ?"
austen#"No -- pray let her have time to look about her ."" "" I have always thought it a very foolish intimacy ,"" said Mr . Knightley presently , "" though I have kept my thoughts to myself ; but I now perceive that it will be a very unfortunate one for Harriet . You will puff her up with such ideas of her own beauty , and of what she has a claim to , that , in a little while , nobody within her reach will be good enough for her . Vanity working on a weak head , produces every sort of mischief . Nothing so easy as for a young lady to raise her expectations too high . Miss Harriet Smith may not find offers of marriage flow in so fast , though she is a very pretty girl ."
austen#"Men of sense , whatever you may chuse to say , do not want silly wives . Men of family would not be very fond of connecting themselves with a girl of such obscurity -- and most prudent men would be afraid of the inconvenience and disgrace they might be involved in , when the mystery of her parentage came to be revealed . Let her marry Robert Martin , and she is safe , respectable , and happy for ever ; but if you encourage her to expect to marry greatly , and teach her to be satisfied with nothing less than a man of consequence and large fortune , she may be a parlour - boarder at Mrs . Goddard ' s all the rest of her life -- or , at least , ( for Harriet Smith is a girl who will marry somebody or other ,) till she grow desperate , and is glad to catch at the old writing - master ' s son ."" "" We think so very differently on this point , Mr . Knightley , that there can be no use in canvassing it . We shall only be making each other more angry . But as to my _letting_ her marry Robert Martin , it is impossible ; she has refused him , and so decidedly , I think , as must prevent any second application ."
austen#"She must abide by the evil of having refused him , whatever it may be ; and as to the refusal itself , I will not pretend to say that I might not influence her a little ; but I assure you there was very little for me or for any body to do . His appearance is so much against him , and his manner so bad , that if she ever were disposed to favour him , she is not now . I can imagine , that before she had seen any body superior , she might tolerate him . He was the brother of her friends , and he took pains to please her ; and altogether , having seen nobody better ( that must have been his great assistant ) she might not , while she was at Abbey - Mill , find him disagreeable . But the case is altered now . She knows now what gentlemen are ; and nothing but a gentleman in education and manner has any chance with Harriet ."""
austen#""" Nonsense , errant nonsense , as ever was talked !"" cried Mr . Knightley .--"" Robert Martin ' s manners have sense , sincerity , and good - humour to recommend them ; and his mind has more true gentility than Harriet Smith could understand ."" Emma made no answer , and tried to look cheerfully unconcerned , but was really feeling uncomfortable and wanting him very much to be gone . She did not repent what she had done ; she still thought herself a better judge of such a point of female right and refinement than he could be ; but yet she had a sort of habitual respect for his judgment in general , which made her dislike having it so loudly against her ; and to have him sitting just opposite to her in angry state , was very disagreeable . Some minutes passed in this unpleasant silence , with only one attempt on Emma ' s side to talk of the weather , but he made no answer ."
austen#"He was thinking . The result of his thoughts appeared at last in these words . "" Robert Martin has no great loss -- if he can but think so ; and I hope it will not be long before he does . Your views for Harriet are best known to yourself ; but as you make no secret of your love of match - making , it is fair to suppose that views , and plans , and projects you have ;-- and as a friend I shall just hint to you that if Elton is the man , I think it will be all labour in vain ."" Emma laughed and disclaimed . He continued ,"
austen#""" Depend upon it , Elton will not do . Elton is a very good sort of man , and a very respectable vicar of Highbury , but not at all likely to make an imprudent match . He knows the value of a good income as well as any body . Elton may talk sentimentally , but he will act rationally . He is as well acquainted with his own claims , as you can be with Harriet ' s . He knows that he is a very handsome young man , and a great favourite wherever he goes ; and from his general way of talking in unreserved moments , when there are only men present , I am convinced that he does not mean to throw himself away ."
austen#"I have heard him speak with great animation of a large family of young ladies that his sisters are intimate with , who have all twenty thousand pounds apiece ."" "" I am very much obliged to you ,"" said Emma , laughing again . "" If I had set my heart on Mr . Elton ' s marrying Harriet , it would have been very kind to open my eyes ; but at present I only want to keep Harriet to myself . I have done with match - making indeed . I could never hope to equal my own doings at Randalls . I shall leave off while I am well ."""
austen#""" Good morning to you ,""-- said he , rising and walking off abruptly . He was very much vexed . He felt the disappointment of the young man , and was mortified to have been the means of promoting it , by the sanction he had given ; and the part which he was persuaded Emma had taken in the affair , was provoking him exceedingly . Emma remained in a state of vexation too ; but there was more indistinctness in the causes of her ' s , than in his . She did not always feel so absolutely satisfied with herself , so entirely convinced that her opinions were right and her adversary ' s wrong , as Mr . Knightley . He walked off in more complete self - approbation than he left for her ."
austen#She was not so materially cast down , however , but that a little time and the return of Harriet were very adequate restoratives . Harriet ' s staying away so long was beginning to make her uneasy . The possibility of the young man ' s coming to Mrs . Goddard ' s that morning , and meeting with Harriet and pleading his own cause , gave alarming ideas . The dread of such a failure after all became the prominent uneasiness ; and when Harriet appeared , and in very good spirits , and without having any such reason to give for her long absence , she felt a satisfaction which settled her with her own mind , and convinced her , that let Mr . Knightley think or say what he would , she had done nothing which woman ' s friendship and woman ' s feelings would not justify . He had frightened her a little about Mr . Elton ; but when she considered that Mr . Knightley could not have observed him as she had done , neither with the interest , nor ( she must be allowed to tell herself , in spite of Mr . Knightley ' s pretensions ) with the skill of such an observer on such a question as herself , that he had spoken it hastily and in anger , she was able to believe , that he had rather said what he wished resentfully to be true , than what he knew any thing about . He certainly might have heard Mr . Elton speak with more unreserve than she had ever done , and Mr . Elton might not be of an imprudent , inconsiderate disposition as to money matters ; he might naturally be rather attentive than otherwise to them ; but then , Mr . Knightley did not make due allowance for the influence of a strong passion at war with all interested motives .
austen#"Mr . Knightley saw no such passion , and of course thought nothing of its effects ; but she saw too much of it to feel a doubt of its overcoming any hesitations that a reasonable prudence might originally suggest ; and more than a reasonable , becoming degree of prudence , she was very sure did not belong to Mr . Elton . Harriet ' s cheerful look and manner established hers : she came back , not to think of Mr . Martin , but to talk of Mr . Elton . Miss Nash had been telling her something , which she repeated immediately with great delight . Mr . Perry had been to Mrs . Goddard ' s to attend a sick child , and Miss Nash had seen him , and he had told Miss Nash , that as he was coming back yesterday from Clayton Park , he had met Mr . Elton , and found to his great surprize , that Mr . Elton was actually on his road to London , and not meaning to return till the morrow , though it was the whist - club night , which he had been never known to miss before ; and Mr . Perry had remonstrated with him about it , and told him how shabby it was in him , their best player , to absent himself , and tried very much to persuade him to put off his journey only one day ; but it would not do ; Mr . Elton had been determined to go on , and had said in a _very_ _particular_ way indeed , that he was going on business which he would not put off for any inducement in the world ; and something about a very enviable commission , and being the bearer of something exceedingly precious . Mr . Perry could not quite understand him , but he was very sure there must be a _lady_ in the case , and he told him so ; and Mr . Elton only looked very conscious and smiling , and rode off in great spirits . Miss Nash had told her all this , and had talked a great deal more about Mr . Elton ; and said , looking so very significantly at her , "" that she did not pretend to understand what his business might be , but she only knew that any woman whom Mr . Elton could prefer , she should think the luckiest woman in the world ; for , beyond a doubt , Mr . Elton had not his equal for beauty or agreeableness ."""
austen#CHAPTER IX Mr . Knightley might quarrel with her , but Emma could not quarrel with herself . He was so much displeased , that it was longer than usual before he came to Hartfield again ; and when they did meet , his grave looks shewed that she was not forgiven . She was sorry , but could not repent . On the contrary , her plans and proceedings were more and more justified and endeared to her by the general appearances of the next few days . The Picture , elegantly framed , came safely to hand soon after Mr . Elton ' s return , and being hung over the mantelpiece of the common sitting - room , he got up to look at it , and sighed out his half sentences of admiration just as he ought ; and as for Harriet ' s feelings , they were visibly forming themselves into as strong and steady an attachment as her youth and sort of mind admitted .
austen#Emma was soon perfectly satisfied of Mr . Martin ' s being no otherwise remembered , than as he furnished a contrast with Mr . Elton , of the utmost advantage to the latter . Her views of improving her little friend ' s mind , by a great deal of useful reading and conversation , had never yet led to more than a few first chapters , and the intention of going on to - morrow . It was much easier to chat than to study ; much pleasanter to let her imagination range and work at Harriet ' s fortune , than to be labouring to enlarge her comprehension or exercise it on sober facts ; and the only literary pursuit which engaged Harriet at present , the only mental provision she was making for the evening of life , was the collecting and transcribing all the riddles of every sort that she could meet with , into a thin quarto of hot - pressed paper , made up by her friend , and ornamented with ciphers and trophies . In this age of literature , such collections on a very grand scale are not uncommon . Miss Nash , head - teacher at Mrs . Goddard ' s , had written out at least three hundred ; and Harriet , who had taken the first hint of it from her , hoped , with Miss Woodhouse ' s help , to get a great many more . Emma assisted with her invention , memory and taste ; and as Harriet wrote a very pretty hand , it was likely to be an arrangement of the first order , in form as well as quantity .
austen#"Mr . Woodhouse was almost as much interested in the business as the girls , and tried very often to recollect something worth their putting in . "" So many clever riddles as there used to be when he was young -- he wondered he could not remember them ! but he hoped he should in time ."" And it always ended in "" Kitty , a fair but frozen maid ."" His good friend Perry , too , whom he had spoken to on the subject , did not at present recollect any thing of the riddle kind ; but he had desired Perry to be upon the watch , and as he went about so much , something , he thought , might come from that quarter . It was by no means his daughter ' s wish that the intellects of Highbury in general should be put under requisition ."
austen#"Mr . Elton was the only one whose assistance she asked . He was invited to contribute any really good enigmas , charades , or conundrums that he might recollect ; and she had the pleasure of seeing him most intently at work with his recollections ; and at the same time , as she could perceive , most earnestly careful that nothing ungallant , nothing that did not breathe a compliment to the sex should pass his lips . They owed to him their two or three politest puzzles ; and the joy and exultation with which at last he recalled , and rather sentimentally recited , that well - known charade , My first doth affliction denote , Which my second is destin ' d to feel And my whole is the best antidote That affliction to soften and heal .-- made her quite sorry to acknowledge that they had transcribed it some pages ago already . "" Why will not you write one yourself for us , Mr ."
austen#"Elton ?"" said she ; "" that is the only security for its freshness ; and nothing could be easier to you ."" "" Oh no ! he had never written , hardly ever , any thing of the kind in his life . The stupidest fellow ! He was afraid not even Miss Woodhouse ""-- he stopt a moment --"" or Miss Smith could inspire him ."""
austen#"The very next day however produced some proof of inspiration . He called for a few moments , just to leave a piece of paper on the table containing , as he said , a charade , which a friend of his had addressed to a young lady , the object of his admiration , but which , from his manner , Emma was immediately convinced must be his own . "" I do not offer it for Miss Smith ' s collection ,"" said he . "" Being my friend ' s , I have no right to expose it in any degree to the public eye , but perhaps you may not dislike looking at it ."" The speech was more to Emma than to Harriet , which Emma could understand . There was deep consciousness about him , and he found it easier to meet her eye than her friend ' s ."
austen#"He was gone the next moment :-- after another moment ' s pause , "" Take it ,"" said Emma , smiling , and pushing the paper towards Harriet --"" it is for you . Take your own ."" But Harriet was in a tremor , and could not touch it ; and Emma , never loth to be first , was obliged to examine it herself . To Miss -- CHARADE ."
austen#My first displays the wealth and pomp of kings , Lords of the earth ! their luxury and ease . Another view of man , my second brings , Behold him there , the monarch of the seas ! But ah ! united , what reverse we have ! Man ' s boasted power and freedom , all are flown ; Lord of the earth and sea , he bends a slave , And woman , lovely woman , reigns alone .
austen#"Thy ready wit the word will soon supply , May its approval beam in that soft eye ! She cast her eye over it , pondered , caught the meaning , read it through again to be quite certain , and quite mistress of the lines , and then passing it to Harriet , sat happily smiling , and saying to herself , while Harriet was puzzling over the paper in all the confusion of hope and dulness , "" Very well , Mr . Elton , very well indeed . I have read worse charades . _Courtship_ -- a very good hint . I give you credit for it . This is feeling your way ."
austen#This is saying very plainly --` Pray , Miss Smith , give me leave to pay my addresses to you . Approve my charade and my intentions in the same glance .' May its approval beam in that soft eye ! Harriet exactly . Soft is the very word for her eye -- of all epithets , the justest that could be given . Thy ready wit the word will soon supply .
austen#Humph -- Harriet ' s ready wit ! All the better . A man must be very much in love , indeed , to describe her so . Ah ! Mr . Knightley , I wish you had the benefit of this ; I think this would convince you . For once in your life you would be obliged to own yourself mistaken .
austen#"An excellent charade indeed ! and very much to the purpose . Things must come to a crisis soon now . She was obliged to break off from these very pleasant observations , which were otherwise of a sort to run into great length , by the eagerness of Harriet ' s wondering questions . "" What can it be , Miss Woodhouse ?-- what can it be ? I have not an idea -- I cannot guess it in the least ."
austen#What can it possibly be ? Do try to find it out , Miss Woodhouse . Do help me . I never saw any thing so hard . Is it kingdom ? I wonder who the friend was -- and who could be the young lady .
austen#Do you think it is a good one ? Can it be woman ? And woman , lovely woman , reigns alone . Can it be Neptune ? Behold him there , the monarch of the seas ! Or a trident ?
austen#or a mermaid ? or a shark ? Oh , no ! shark is only one syllable . It must be very clever , or he would not have brought it . Oh !
austen#"Miss Woodhouse , do you think we shall ever find it out ?"" "" Mermaids and sharks ! Nonsense ! My dear Harriet , what are you thinking of ? Where would be the use of his bringing us a charade made by a friend upon a mermaid or a shark ? Give me the paper and listen ."
austen#For Miss ----------, read Miss Smith . My first displays the wealth and pomp of kings , Lords of the earth ! their luxury and ease . That is _court_ . Another view of man , my second brings ; Behold him there , the monarch of the seas ! That is _ship_ ;-- plain as it can be .-- Now for the cream .
austen#But ah ! united , ( _courtship_ , you know ,) what reverse we have ! Man ' s boasted power and freedom , all are flown . Lord of the earth and sea , he bends a slave , And woman , lovely woman , reigns alone . A very proper compliment !-- and then follows the application , which I think , my dear Harriet , you cannot find much difficulty in comprehending . Read it in comfort to yourself .
austen#"There can be no doubt of its being written for you and to you ."" Harriet could not long resist so delightful a persuasion . She read the concluding lines , and was all flutter and happiness . She could not speak . But she was not wanted to speak . It was enough for her to feel ."
austen#"Emma spoke for her . "" There is so pointed , and so particular a meaning in this compliment ,"" said she , "" that I cannot have a doubt as to Mr . Elton ' s intentions . You are his object -- and you will soon receive the completest proof of it . I thought it must be so . I thought I could not be so deceived ; but now , it is clear ; the state of his mind is as clear and decided , as my wishes on the subject have been ever since I knew you . Yes , Harriet , just so long have I been wanting the very circumstance to happen what has happened ."
austen#I could never tell whether an attachment between you and Mr . Elton were most desirable or most natural . Its probability and its eligibility have really so equalled each other ! I am very happy . I congratulate you , my dear Harriet , with all my heart . This is an attachment which a woman may well feel pride in creating . This is a connexion which offers nothing but good .
austen#"It will give you every thing that you want -- consideration , independence , a proper home -- it will fix you in the centre of all your real friends , close to Hartfield and to me , and confirm our intimacy for ever . This , Harriet , is an alliance which can never raise a blush in either of us ."" "" Dear Miss Woodhouse !"" -- and "" Dear Miss Woodhouse ,"" was all that Harriet , with many tender embraces could articulate at first ; but when they did arrive at something more like conversation , it was sufficiently clear to her friend that she saw , felt , anticipated , and remembered just as she ought . Mr . Elton ' s superiority had very ample acknowledgment . "" Whatever you say is always right ,"" cried Harriet , "" and therefore I suppose , and believe , and hope it must be so ; but otherwise I could not have imagined it ."
austen#"It is so much beyond any thing I deserve . Mr . Elton , who might marry any body ! There cannot be two opinions about _him_ . He is so very superior . Only think of those sweet verses --` To Miss --------.' Dear me , how clever !-- Could it really be meant for me ?"""
austen#""" I cannot make a question , or listen to a question about that . It is a certainty . Receive it on my judgment . It is a sort of prologue to the play , a motto to the chapter ; and will be soon followed by matter - of - fact prose ."" "" It is a sort of thing which nobody could have expected . I am sure , a month ago , I had no more idea myself !-- The strangest things do take place !"""
austen#""" When Miss Smiths and Mr . Eltons get acquainted -- they do indeed -- and really it is strange ; it is out of the common course that what is so evidently , so palpably desirable -- what courts the pre - arrangement of other people , should so immediately shape itself into the proper form . You and Mr . Elton are by situation called together ; you belong to one another by every circumstance of your respective homes . Your marrying will be equal to the match at Randalls . There does seem to be a something in the air of Hartfield which gives love exactly the right direction , and sends it into the very channel where it ought to flow . The course of true love never did run smooth -- A Hartfield edition of Shakespeare would have a long note on that passage ."""
austen#""" That Mr . Elton should really be in love with me ,-- me , of all people , who did not know him , to speak to him , at Michaelmas ! And he , the very handsomest man that ever was , and a man that every body looks up to , quite like Mr . Knightley ! His company so sought after , that every body says he need not eat a single meal by himself if he does not chuse it ; that he has more invitations than there are days in the week . And so excellent in the Church ! Miss Nash has put down all the texts he has ever preached from since he came to Highbury . Dear me !"
austen#"When I look back to the first time I saw him ! How little did I think !-- The two Abbots and I ran into the front room and peeped through the blind when we heard he was going by , and Miss Nash came and scolded us away , and staid to look through herself ; however , she called me back presently , and let me look too , which was very good - natured . And how beautiful we thought he looked ! He was arm - in - arm with Mr . Cole ."" "" This is an alliance which , whoever -- whatever your friends may be , must be agreeable to them , provided at least they have common sense ; and we are not to be addressing our conduct to fools ."
austen#"If they are anxious to see you _happily_ married , here is a man whose amiable character gives every assurance of it ;-- if they wish to have you settled in the same country and circle which they have chosen to place you in , here it will be accomplished ; and if their only object is that you should , in the common phrase , be _well_ married , here is the comfortable fortune , the respectable establishment , the rise in the world which must satisfy them ."" "" Yes , very true . How nicely you talk ; I love to hear you . You understand every thing . You and Mr . Elton are one as clever as the other . This charade !-- If I had studied a twelvemonth , I could never have made any thing like it ."""
austen#""" I thought he meant to try his skill , by his manner of declining it yesterday ."" "" I do think it is , without exception , the best charade I ever read ."" "" I never read one more to the purpose , certainly ."" "" It is as long again as almost all we have had before ."" "" I do not consider its length as particularly in its favour . Such things in general cannot be too short ."""
austen#"Harriet was too intent on the lines to hear . The most satisfactory comparisons were rising in her mind . "" It is one thing ,"" said she , presently -- her cheeks in a glow --"" to have very good sense in a common way , like every body else , and if there is any thing to say , to sit down and write a letter , and say just what you must , in a short way ; and another , to write verses and charades like this ."" Emma could not have desired a more spirited rejection of Mr . Martin ' s prose . "" Such sweet lines !"" continued Harriet --"" these two last !-- But how shall I ever be able to return the paper , or say I have found it out ?-- Oh !"
austen#"Miss Woodhouse , what can we do about that ?"" "" Leave it to me . You do nothing . He will be here this evening , I dare say , and then I will give it him back , and some nonsense or other will pass between us , and you shall not be committed .-- Your soft eyes shall chuse their own time for beaming . Trust to me ."" "" Oh !"
austen#"Miss Woodhouse , what a pity that I must not write this beautiful charade into my book ! I am sure I have not got one half so good ."" "" Leave out the two last lines , and there is no reason why you should not write it into your book ."" "" Oh ! but those two lines are ""-- --"" The best of all ."
austen#Granted ;-- for private enjoyment ; and for private enjoyment keep them . They are not at all the less written you know , because you divide them . The couplet does not cease to be , nor does its meaning change . But take it away , and all _appropriation_ ceases , and a very pretty gallant charade remains , fit for any collection . Depend upon it , he would not like to have his charade slighted , much better than his passion . A poet in love must be encouraged in both capacities , or neither .
austen#"Give me the book , I will write it down , and then there can be no possible reflection on you ."" Harriet submitted , though her mind could hardly separate the parts , so as to feel quite sure that her friend were not writing down a declaration of love . It seemed too precious an offering for any degree of publicity . "" I shall never let that book go out of my own hands ,"" said she . "" Very well ,"" replied Emma ; "" a most natural feeling ; and the longer it lasts , the better I shall be pleased . But here is my father coming : you will not object to my reading the charade to him ."
austen#"It will be giving him so much pleasure ! He loves any thing of the sort , and especially any thing that pays woman a compliment . He has the tenderest spirit of gallantry towards us all !-- You must let me read it to him ."" Harriet looked grave . "" My dear Harriet , you must not refine too much upon this charade .-- You will betray your feelings improperly , if you are too conscious and too quick , and appear to affix more meaning , or even quite all the meaning which may be affixed to it . Do not be overpowered by such a little tribute of admiration ."
austen#"If he had been anxious for secrecy , he would not have left the paper while I was by ; but he rather pushed it towards me than towards you . Do not let us be too solemn on the business . He has encouragement enough to proceed , without our sighing out our souls over this charade ."" "" Oh ! no -- I hope I shall not be ridiculous about it . Do as you please ."""
austen#"Mr . Woodhouse came in , and very soon led to the subject again , by the recurrence of his very frequent inquiry of "" Well , my dears , how does your book go on ?-- Have you got any thing fresh ?"" "" Yes , papa ; we have something to read you , something quite fresh . A piece of paper was found on the table this morning --( dropt , we suppose , by a fairy )-- containing a very pretty charade , and we have just copied it in ."" She read it to him , just as he liked to have any thing read , slowly and distinctly , and two or three times over , with explanations of every part as she proceeded -- and he was very much pleased , and , as she had foreseen , especially struck with the complimentary conclusion . "" Aye , that ' s very just , indeed , that ' s very properly said . Very true ."
austen#"` Woman , lovely woman .' It is such a pretty charade , my dear , that I can easily guess what fairy brought it .-- Nobody could have written so prettily , but you , Emma ."" Emma only nodded , and smiled .-- After a little thinking , and a very tender sigh , he added , "" Ah ! it is no difficulty to see who you take after ! Your dear mother was so clever at all those things !"
austen#"If I had but her memory ! But I can remember nothing ;-- not even that particular riddle which you have heard me mention ; I can only recollect the first stanza ; and there are several . Kitty , a fair but frozen maid , Kindled a flame I yet deplore , The hood - wink ' d boy I called to aid , Though of his near approach afraid , So fatal to my suit before . And that is all that I can recollect of it -- but it is very clever all the way through . But I think , my dear , you said you had got it ."" "" Yes , papa , it is written out in our second page ."
austen#"We copied it from the Elegant Extracts . It was Garrick ' s , you know ."" "" Aye , very true .-- I wish I could recollect more of it . Kitty , a fair but frozen maid . The name makes me think of poor Isabella ; for she was very near being christened Catherine after her grandmama . I hope we shall have her here next week ."
austen#"Have you thought , my dear , where you shall put her -- and what room there will be for the children ?"" "" Oh ! yes -- she will have her own room , of course ; the room she always has ;-- and there is the nursery for the children ,-- just as usual , you know . Why should there be any change ?"" "" I do not know , my dear -- but it is so long since she was here !-- not since last Easter , and then only for a few days .-- Mr . John Knightley ' s being a lawyer is very inconvenient .-- Poor Isabella !-- she is sadly taken away from us all !-- and how sorry she will be when she comes , not to see Miss Taylor here !"""
austen#""" She will not be surprized , papa , at least ."" "" I do not know , my dear . I am sure I was very much surprized when I first heard she was going to be married ."" "" We must ask Mr . and Mrs . Weston to dine with us , while Isabella is here ."" "" Yes , my dear , if there is time .-- But --( in a very depressed tone )-- she is coming for only one week . There will not be time for any thing ."""
austen#""" It is unfortunate that they cannot stay longer -- but it seems a case of necessity . Mr . John Knightley must be in town again on the 28th , and we ought to be thankful , papa , that we are to have the whole of the time they can give to the country , that two or three days are not to be taken out for the Abbey . Mr . Knightley promises to give up his claim this Christmas -- though you know it is longer since they were with him , than with us ."" "" It would be very hard , indeed , my dear , if poor Isabella were to be anywhere but at Hartfield ."" Mr . Woodhouse could never allow for Mr . Knightley ' s claims on his brother , or any body ' s claims on Isabella , except his own . He sat musing a little while , and then said ,"
austen#""" But I do not see why poor Isabella should be obliged to go back so soon , though he does . I think , Emma , I shall try and persuade her to stay longer with us . She and the children might stay very well ."" "" Ah ! papa -- that is what you never have been able to accomplish , and I do not think you ever will . Isabella cannot bear to stay behind her husband ."""
austen#"This was too true for contradiction . Unwelcome as it was , Mr . Woodhouse could only give a submissive sigh ; and as Emma saw his spirits affected by the idea of his daughter ' s attachment to her husband , she immediately led to such a branch of the subject as must raise them . "" Harriet must give us as much of her company as she can while my brother and sister are here . I am sure she will be pleased with the children . We are very proud of the children , are not we , papa ? I wonder which she will think the handsomest , Henry or John ?"""
austen#""" Aye , I wonder which she will . Poor little dears , how glad they will be to come . They are very fond of being at Hartfield , Harriet ."" "" I dare say they are , sir . I am sure I do not know who is not ."" "" Henry is a fine boy , but John is very like his mama ."
austen#Henry is the eldest , he was named after me , not after his father . John , the second , is named after his father . Some people are surprized , I believe , that the eldest was not , but Isabella would have him called Henry , which I thought very pretty of her . And he is a very clever boy , indeed . They are all remarkably clever ; and they have so many pretty ways . They will come and stand by my chair , and say , ` Grandpapa , can you give me a bit of string ?'
austen#"and once Henry asked me for a knife , but I told him knives were only made for grandpapas . I think their father is too rough with them very often ."" "" He appears rough to you ,"" said Emma , "" because you are so very gentle yourself ; but if you could compare him with other papas , you would not think him rough . He wishes his boys to be active and hardy ; and if they misbehave , can give them a sharp word now and then ; but he is an affectionate father -- certainly Mr . John Knightley is an affectionate father . The children are all fond of him ."" "" And then their uncle comes in , and tosses them up to the ceiling in a very frightful way !"""
austen#""" But they like it , papa ; there is nothing they like so much . It is such enjoyment to them , that if their uncle did not lay down the rule of their taking turns , whichever began would never give way to the other ."" "" Well , I cannot understand it ."" "" That is the case with us all , papa . One half of the world cannot understand the pleasures of the other ."" Later in the morning , and just as the girls were going to separate in preparation for the regular four o ' clock dinner , the hero of this inimitable charade walked in again ."
austen#"Harriet turned away ; but Emma could receive him with the usual smile , and her quick eye soon discerned in his the consciousness of having made a push -- of having thrown a die ; and she imagined he was come to see how it might turn up . His ostensible reason , however , was to ask whether Mr . Woodhouse ' s party could be made up in the evening without him , or whether he should be in the smallest degree necessary at Hartfield . If he were , every thing else must give way ; but otherwise his friend Cole had been saying so much about his dining with him -- had made such a point of it , that he had promised him conditionally to come . Emma thanked him , but could not allow of his disappointing his friend on their account ; her father was sure of his rubber . He re - urged -- she re - declined ; and he seemed then about to make his bow , when taking the paper from the table , she returned it -- "" Oh !"
austen#"here is the charade you were so obliging as to leave with us ; thank you for the sight of it . We admired it so much , that I have ventured to write it into Miss Smith ' s collection . Your friend will not take it amiss I hope . Of course I have not transcribed beyond the first eight lines ."" Mr . Elton certainly did not very well know what to say . He looked rather doubtingly -- rather confused ; said something about "" honour ,""-- glanced at Emma and at Harriet , and then seeing the book open on the table , took it up , and examined it very attentively ."
austen#"With the view of passing off an awkward moment , Emma smilingly said , "" You must make my apologies to your friend ; but so good a charade must not be confined to one or two . He may be sure of every woman ' s approbation while he writes with such gallantry ."" "" I have no hesitation in saying ,"" replied Mr . Elton , though hesitating a good deal while he spoke ; "" I have no hesitation in saying -- at least if my friend feels at all as _I_ do -- I have not the smallest doubt that , could he see his little effusion honoured as _I_ see it , ( looking at the book again , and replacing it on the table ), he would consider it as the proudest moment of his life ."" After this speech he was gone as soon as possible . Emma could not think it too soon ; for with all his good and agreeable qualities , there was a sort of parade in his speeches which was very apt to incline her to laugh ."
austen#She ran away to indulge the inclination , leaving the tender and the sublime of pleasure to Harriet ' s share . CHAPTER X Though now the middle of December , there had yet been no weather to prevent the young ladies from tolerably regular exercise ; and on the morrow , Emma had a charitable visit to pay to a poor sick family , who lived a little way out of Highbury . Their road to this detached cottage was down Vicarage Lane , a lane leading at right angles from the broad , though irregular , main street of the place ; and , as may be inferred , containing the blessed abode of Mr . Elton . A few inferior dwellings were first to be passed , and then , about a quarter of a mile down the lane rose the Vicarage , an old and not very good house , almost as close to the road as it could be . It had no advantage of situation ; but had been very much smartened up by the present proprietor ; and , such as it was , there could be no possibility of the two friends passing it without a slackened pace and observing eyes .-- Emma ' s remark was --
austen#""" There it is . There go you and your riddle - book one of these days ."" -- Harriet ' s was -- "" Oh , what a sweet house !-- How very beautiful !-- There are the yellow curtains that Miss Nash admires so much ."" "" I do not often walk this way _now_ ,"" said Emma , as they proceeded , "" but _then_ there will be an inducement , and I shall gradually get intimately acquainted with all the hedges , gates , pools and pollards of this part of Highbury ."" Harriet , she found , had never in her life been within side the Vicarage , and her curiosity to see it was so extreme , that , considering exteriors and probabilities , Emma could only class it , as a proof of love , with Mr . Elton ' s seeing ready wit in her ."
austen#""" I wish we could contrive it ,"" said she ; "" but I cannot think of any tolerable pretence for going in ;-- no servant that I want to inquire about of his housekeeper -- no message from my father ."" She pondered , but could think of nothing . After a mutual silence of some minutes , Harriet thus began again -- "" I do so wonder , Miss Woodhouse , that you should not be married , or going to be married ! so charming as you are !"" --"
austen#"Emma laughed , and replied , "" My being charming , Harriet , is not quite enough to induce me to marry ; I must find other people charming -- one other person at least . And I am not only , not going to be married , at present , but have very little intention of ever marrying at all ."" "" Ah !-- so you say ; but I cannot believe it ."" "" I must see somebody very superior to any one I have seen yet , to be tempted ; Mr . Elton , you know , ( recollecting herself ,) is out of the question : and I do _not_ wish to see any such person . I would rather not be tempted ."
austen#"I cannot really change for the better . If I were to marry , I must expect to repent it ."" "" Dear me !-- it is so odd to hear a woman talk so !"" -- "" I have none of the usual inducements of women to marry . Were I to fall in love , indeed , it would be a different thing !"
austen#"but I never have been in love ; it is not my way , or my nature ; and I do not think I ever shall . And , without love , I am sure I should be a fool to change such a situation as mine . Fortune I do not want ; employment I do not want ; consequence I do not want : I believe few married women are half as much mistress of their husband ' s house as I am of Hartfield ; and never , never could I expect to be so truly beloved and important ; so always first and always right in any man ' s eyes as I am in my father ' s ."" "" But then , to be an old maid at last , like Miss Bates !"" "" That is as formidable an image as you could present , Harriet ; and if I thought I should ever be like Miss Bates ! so silly -- so satisfied -- so smiling -- so prosing -- so undistinguishing and unfastidious -- and so apt to tell every thing relative to every body about me , I would marry to - morrow ."
austen#"But between _us_ , I am convinced there never can be any likeness , except in being unmarried ."" "" But still , you will be an old maid ! and that ' s so dreadful !"" "" Never mind , Harriet , I shall not be a poor old maid ; and it is poverty only which makes celibacy contemptible to a generous public ! A single woman , with a very narrow income , must be a ridiculous , disagreeable old maid ! the proper sport of boys and girls , but a single woman , of good fortune , is always respectable , and may be as sensible and pleasant as any body else ."
austen#"And the distinction is not quite so much against the candour and common sense of the world as appears at first ; for a very narrow income has a tendency to contract the mind , and sour the temper . Those who can barely live , and who live perforce in a very small , and generally very inferior , society , may well be illiberal and cross . This does not apply , however , to Miss Bates ; she is only too good natured and too silly to suit me ; but , in general , she is very much to the taste of every body , though single and though poor . Poverty certainly has not contracted her mind : I really believe , if she had only a shilling in the world , she would be very likely to give away sixpence of it ; and nobody is afraid of her : that is a great charm ."" "" Dear me ! but what shall you do ?"
austen#"how shall you employ yourself when you grow old ?"" "" If I know myself , Harriet , mine is an active , busy mind , with a great many independent resources ; and I do not perceive why I should be more in want of employment at forty or fifty than one - and - twenty . Woman ' s usual occupations of hand and mind will be as open to me then as they are now ; or with no important variation . If I draw less , I shall read more ; if I give up music , I shall take to carpet - work . And as for objects of interest , objects for the affections , which is in truth the great point of inferiority , the want of which is really the great evil to be avoided in _not_ marrying , I shall be very well off , with all the children of a sister I love so much , to care about . There will be enough of them , in all probability , to supply every sort of sensation that declining life can need ."
austen#"There will be enough for every hope and every fear ; and though my attachment to none can equal that of a parent , it suits my ideas of comfort better than what is warmer and blinder . My nephews and nieces !-- I shall often have a niece with me ."" "" Do you know Miss Bates ' s niece ? That is , I know you must have seen her a hundred times -- but are you acquainted ?"" "" Oh ! yes ; we are always forced to be acquainted whenever she comes to Highbury ."
austen#"By the bye , _that_ is almost enough to put one out of conceit with a niece . Heaven forbid ! at least , that I should ever bore people half so much about all the Knightleys together , as she does about Jane Fairfax . One is sick of the very name of Jane Fairfax . Every letter from her is read forty times over ; her compliments to all friends go round and round again ; and if she does but send her aunt the pattern of a stomacher , or knit a pair of garters for her grandmother , one hears of nothing else for a month . I wish Jane Fairfax very well ; but she tires me to death ."""
austen#"They were now approaching the cottage , and all idle topics were superseded . Emma was very compassionate ; and the distresses of the poor were as sure of relief from her personal attention and kindness , her counsel and her patience , as from her purse . She understood their ways , could allow for their ignorance and their temptations , had no romantic expectations of extraordinary virtue from those for whom education had done so little ; entered into their troubles with ready sympathy , and always gave her assistance with as much intelligence as good - will . In the present instance , it was sickness and poverty together which she came to visit ; and after remaining there as long as she could give comfort or advice , she quitted the cottage with such an impression of the scene as made her say to Harriet , as they walked away , "" These are the sights , Harriet , to do one good . How trifling they make every thing else appear !-- I feel now as if I could think of nothing but these poor creatures all the rest of the day ; and yet , who can say how soon it may all vanish from my mind ?"""
austen#""" Very true ,"" said Harriet . "" Poor creatures ! one can think of nothing else ."" "" And really , I do not think the impression will soon be over ,"" said Emma , as she crossed the low hedge , and tottering footstep which ended the narrow , slippery path through the cottage garden , and brought them into the lane again . "" I do not think it will ,"" stopping to look once more at all the outward wretchedness of the place , and recall the still greater within . "" Oh !"
austen#"dear , no ,"" said her companion . They walked on . The lane made a slight bend ; and when that bend was passed , Mr . Elton was immediately in sight ; and so near as to give Emma time only to say farther , "" Ah ! Harriet , here comes a very sudden trial of our stability in good thoughts . Well , ( smiling ,) I hope it may be allowed that if compassion has produced exertion and relief to the sufferers , it has done all that is truly important ."
austen#"If we feel for the wretched , enough to do all we can for them , the rest is empty sympathy , only distressing to ourselves ."" Harriet could just answer , "" Oh ! dear , yes ,"" before the gentleman joined them . The wants and sufferings of the poor family , however , were the first subject on meeting . He had been going to call on them . His visit he would now defer ; but they had a very interesting parley about what could be done and should be done ."
austen#"Mr . Elton then turned back to accompany them . "" To fall in with each other on such an errand as this ,"" thought Emma ; "" to meet in a charitable scheme ; this will bring a great increase of love on each side . I should not wonder if it were to bring on the declaration . It must , if I were not here . I wish I were anywhere else ."" Anxious to separate herself from them as far as she could , she soon afterwards took possession of a narrow footpath , a little raised on one side of the lane , leaving them together in the main road ."
austen#But she had not been there two minutes when she found that Harriet ' s habits of dependence and imitation were bringing her up too , and that , in short , they would both be soon after her . This would not do ; she immediately stopped , under pretence of having some alteration to make in the lacing of her half - boot , and stooping down in complete occupation of the footpath , begged them to have the goodness to walk on , and she would follow in half a minute . They did as they were desired ; and by the time she judged it reasonable to have done with her boot , she had the comfort of farther delay in her power , being overtaken by a child from the cottage , setting out , according to orders , with her pitcher , to fetch broth from Hartfield . To walk by the side of this child , and talk to and question her , was the most natural thing in the world , or would have been the most natural , had she been acting just then without design ; and by this means the others were still able to keep ahead , without any obligation of waiting for her . She gained on them , however , involuntarily : the child ' s pace was quick , and theirs rather slow ; and she was the more concerned at it , from their being evidently in a conversation which interested them . Mr . Elton was speaking with animation , Harriet listening with a very pleased attention ; and Emma , having sent the child on , was beginning to think how she might draw back a little more , when they both looked around , and she was obliged to join them .
austen#"Mr . Elton was still talking , still engaged in some interesting detail ; and Emma experienced some disappointment when she found that he was only giving his fair companion an account of the yesterday ' s party at his friend Cole ' s , and that she was come in herself for the Stilton cheese , the north Wiltshire , the butter , the cellery , the beet - root , and all the dessert . "" This would soon have led to something better , of course ,"" was her consoling reflection ; "" any thing interests between those who love ; and any thing will serve as introduction to what is near the heart . If I could but have kept longer away !"" They now walked on together quietly , till within view of the vicarage pales , when a sudden resolution , of at least getting Harriet into the house , made her again find something very much amiss about her boot , and fall behind to arrange it once more . She then broke the lace off short , and dexterously throwing it into a ditch , was presently obliged to entreat them to stop , and acknowledged her inability to put herself to rights so as to be able to walk home in tolerable comfort . "" Part of my lace is gone ,"" said she , "" and I do not know how I am to contrive ."
austen#"I really am a most troublesome companion to you both , but I hope I am not often so ill - equipped . Mr . Elton , I must beg leave to stop at your house , and ask your housekeeper for a bit of ribband or string , or any thing just to keep my boot on ."" Mr . Elton looked all happiness at this proposition ; and nothing could exceed his alertness and attention in conducting them into his house and endeavouring to make every thing appear to advantage . The room they were taken into was the one he chiefly occupied , and looking forwards ; behind it was another with which it immediately communicated ; the door between them was open , and Emma passed into it with the housekeeper to receive her assistance in the most comfortable manner . She was obliged to leave the door ajar as she found it ; but she fully intended that Mr . Elton should close it . It was not closed , however , it still remained ajar ; but by engaging the housekeeper in incessant conversation , she hoped to make it practicable for him to chuse his own subject in the adjoining room ."
austen#For ten minutes she could hear nothing but herself . It could be protracted no longer . She was then obliged to be finished , and make her appearance . The lovers were standing together at one of the windows . It had a most favourable aspect ; and , for half a minute , Emma felt the glory of having schemed successfully . But it would not do ; he had not come to the point .
austen#"He had been most agreeable , most delightful ; he had told Harriet that he had seen them go by , and had purposely followed them ; other little gallantries and allusions had been dropt , but nothing serious . "" Cautious , very cautious ,"" thought Emma ; "" he advances inch by inch , and will hazard nothing till he believes himself secure ."" Still , however , though every thing had not been accomplished by her ingenious device , she could not but flatter herself that it had been the occasion of much present enjoyment to both , and must be leading them forward to the great event . CHAPTER XI Mr . Elton must now be left to himself . It was no longer in Emma ' s power to superintend his happiness or quicken his measures ."
austen#The coming of her sister ' s family was so very near at hand , that first in anticipation , and then in reality , it became henceforth her prime object of interest ; and during the ten days of their stay at Hartfield it was not to be expected -- she did not herself expect -- that any thing beyond occasional , fortuitous assistance could be afforded by her to the lovers . They might advance rapidly if they would , however ; they must advance somehow or other whether they would or no . She hardly wished to have more leisure for them . There are people , who the more you do for them , the less they will do for themselves . Mr . and Mrs . John Knightley , from having been longer than usual absent from Surry , were exciting of course rather more than the usual interest . Till this year , every long vacation since their marriage had been divided between Hartfield and Donwell Abbey ; but all the holidays of this autumn had been given to sea - bathing for the children , and it was therefore many months since they had been seen in a regular way by their Surry connexions , or seen at all by Mr . Woodhouse , who could not be induced to get so far as London , even for poor Isabella ' s sake ; and who consequently was now most nervously and apprehensively happy in forestalling this too short visit .
austen#He thought much of the evils of the journey for her , and not a little of the fatigues of his own horses and coachman who were to bring some of the party the last half of the way ; but his alarms were needless ; the sixteen miles being happily accomplished , and Mr . and Mrs . John Knightley , their five children , and a competent number of nursery - maids , all reaching Hartfield in safety . The bustle and joy of such an arrival , the many to be talked to , welcomed , encouraged , and variously dispersed and disposed of , produced a noise and confusion which his nerves could not have borne under any other cause , nor have endured much longer even for this ; but the ways of Hartfield and the feelings of her father were so respected by Mrs . John Knightley , that in spite of maternal solicitude for the immediate enjoyment of her little ones , and for their having instantly all the liberty and attendance , all the eating and drinking , and sleeping and playing , which they could possibly wish for , without the smallest delay , the children were never allowed to be long a disturbance to him , either in themselves or in any restless attendance on them . Mrs . John Knightley was a pretty , elegant little woman , of gentle , quiet manners , and a disposition remarkably amiable and affectionate ; wrapt up in her family ; a devoted wife , a doating mother , and so tenderly attached to her father and sister that , but for these higher ties , a warmer love might have seemed impossible . She could never see a fault in any of them . She was not a woman of strong understanding or any quickness ; and with this resemblance of her father , she inherited also much of his constitution ; was delicate in her own health , over - careful of that of her children , had many fears and many nerves , and was as fond of her own Mr . Wingfield in town as her father could be of Mr . Perry . They were alike too , in a general benevolence of temper , and a strong habit of regard for every old acquaintance .
austen#Mr . John Knightley was a tall , gentleman - like , and very clever man ; rising in his profession , domestic , and respectable in his private character ; but with reserved manners which prevented his being generally pleasing ; and capable of being sometimes out of humour . He was not an ill - tempered man , not so often unreasonably cross as to deserve such a reproach ; but his temper was not his great perfection ; and , indeed , with such a worshipping wife , it was hardly possible that any natural defects in it should not be increased . The extreme sweetness of her temper must hurt his . He had all the clearness and quickness of mind which she wanted , and he could sometimes act an ungracious , or say a severe thing . He was not a great favourite with his fair sister - in - law . Nothing wrong in him escaped her .
austen#She was quick in feeling the little injuries to Isabella , which Isabella never felt herself . Perhaps she might have passed over more had his manners been flattering to Isabella ' s sister , but they were only those of a calmly kind brother and friend , without praise and without blindness ; but hardly any degree of personal compliment could have made her regardless of that greatest fault of all in her eyes which he sometimes fell into , the want of respectful forbearance towards her father . There he had not always the patience that could have been wished . Mr . Woodhouse ' s peculiarities and fidgetiness were sometimes provoking him to a rational remonstrance or sharp retort equally ill - bestowed . It did not often happen ; for Mr . John Knightley had really a great regard for his father - in - law , and generally a strong sense of what was due to him ; but it was too often for Emma ' s charity , especially as there was all the pain of apprehension frequently to be endured , though the offence came not . The beginning , however , of every visit displayed none but the properest feelings , and this being of necessity so short might be hoped to pass away in unsullied cordiality .
austen#"They had not been long seated and composed when Mr . Woodhouse , with a melancholy shake of the head and a sigh , called his daughter ' s attention to the sad change at Hartfield since she had been there last . "" Ah , my dear ,"" said he , "" poor Miss Taylor -- It is a grievous business ."" "" Oh yes , sir ,"" cried she with ready sympathy , "" how you must miss her ! And dear Emma , too !-- What a dreadful loss to you both !-- I have been so grieved for you .-- I could not imagine how you could possibly do without her .-- It is a sad change indeed .-- But I hope she is pretty well , sir ."" "" Pretty well , my dear -- I hope -- pretty well .-- I do not know but that the place agrees with her tolerably ."" Mr . John Knightley here asked Emma quietly whether there were any doubts of the air of Randalls ."
austen#""" Oh ! no -- none in the least . I never saw Mrs . Weston better in my life -- never looking so well . Papa is only speaking his own regret ."" "" Very much to the honour of both ,"" was the handsome reply . "" And do you see her , sir , tolerably often ?"""
austen#"asked Isabella in the plaintive tone which just suited her father . Mr . Woodhouse hesitated .--"" Not near so often , my dear , as I could wish ."" "" Oh ! papa , we have missed seeing them but one entire day since they married . Either in the morning or evening of every day , excepting one , have we seen either Mr . Weston or Mrs . Weston , and generally both , either at Randalls or here -- and as you may suppose , Isabella , most frequently here . They are very , very kind in their visits ."
austen#"Mr . Weston is really as kind as herself . Papa , if you speak in that melancholy way , you will be giving Isabella a false idea of us all . Every body must be aware that Miss Taylor must be missed , but every body ought also to be assured that Mr . and Mrs . Weston do really prevent our missing her by any means to the extent we ourselves anticipated -- which is the exact truth ."" "" Just as it should be ,"" said Mr . John Knightley , "" and just as I hoped it was from your letters . Her wish of shewing you attention could not be doubted , and his being a disengaged and social man makes it all easy . I have been always telling you , my love , that I had no idea of the change being so very material to Hartfield as you apprehended ; and now you have Emma ' s account , I hope you will be satisfied ."""
austen#""" Why , to be sure ,"" said Mr . Woodhouse --"" yes , certainly -- I cannot deny that Mrs . Weston , poor Mrs . Weston , does come and see us pretty often -- but then -- she is always obliged to go away again ."" "" It would be very hard upon Mr . Weston if she did not , papa .-- You quite forget poor Mr . Weston ."" "" I think , indeed ,"" said John Knightley pleasantly , "" that Mr . Weston has some little claim . You and I , Emma , will venture to take the part of the poor husband . I , being a husband , and you not being a wife , the claims of the man may very likely strike us with equal force ."
austen#"As for Isabella , she has been married long enough to see the convenience of putting all the Mr . Westons aside as much as she can ."" "" Me , my love ,"" cried his wife , hearing and understanding only in part .-- "" Are you talking about me ?-- I am sure nobody ought to be , or can be , a greater advocate for matrimony than I am ; and if it had not been for the misery of her leaving Hartfield , I should never have thought of Miss Taylor but as the most fortunate woman in the world ; and as to slighting Mr . Weston , that excellent Mr . Weston , I think there is nothing he does not deserve . I believe he is one of the very best - tempered men that ever existed . Excepting yourself and your brother , I do not know his equal for temper . I shall never forget his flying Henry ' s kite for him that very windy day last Easter -- and ever since his particular kindness last September twelvemonth in writing that note , at twelve o ' clock at night , on purpose to assure me that there was no scarlet fever at Cobham , I have been convinced there could not be a more feeling heart nor a better man in existence .-- If any body can deserve him , it must be Miss Taylor ."" "" Where is the young man ?"""
austen#"said John Knightley . "" Has he been here on this occasion -- or has he not ?"" "" He has not been here yet ,"" replied Emma . "" There was a strong expectation of his coming soon after the marriage , but it ended in nothing ; and I have not heard him mentioned lately ."" "" But you should tell them of the letter , my dear ,"" said her father . "" He wrote a letter to poor Mrs . Weston , to congratulate her , and a very proper , handsome letter it was ."
austen#"She shewed it to me . I thought it very well done of him indeed . Whether it was his own idea you know , one cannot tell . He is but young , and his uncle , perhaps --"" "" My dear papa , he is three - and - twenty . You forget how time passes ."""
austen#""" Three - and - twenty !-- is he indeed ?-- Well , I could not have thought it -- and he was but two years old when he lost his poor mother ! Well , time does fly indeed !-- and my memory is very bad . However , it was an exceeding good , pretty letter , and gave Mr . and Mrs . Weston a great deal of pleasure . I remember it was written from Weymouth , and dated Sept . 28th -- and began , ` My dear Madam ,' but I forget how it went on ; and it was signed ` F . C . Weston Churchill .' -- I remember that perfectly ."" "" How very pleasing and proper of him !"""
austen#"cried the good - hearted Mrs . John Knightley . "" I have no doubt of his being a most amiable young man . But how sad it is that he should not live at home with his father ! There is something so shocking in a child ' s being taken away from his parents and natural home ! I never could comprehend how Mr . Weston could part with him . To give up one ' s child !"
austen#"I really never could think well of any body who proposed such a thing to any body else ."" "" Nobody ever did think well of the Churchills , I fancy ,"" observed Mr . John Knightley coolly . "" But you need not imagine Mr . Weston to have felt what you would feel in giving up Henry or John . Mr . Weston is rather an easy , cheerful - tempered man , than a man of strong feelings ; he takes things as he finds them , and makes enjoyment of them somehow or other , depending , I suspect , much more upon what is called society for his comforts , that is , upon the power of eating and drinking , and playing whist with his neighbours five times a week , than upon family affection , or any thing that home affords ."" Emma could not like what bordered on a reflection on Mr . Weston , and had half a mind to take it up ; but she struggled , and let it pass . She would keep the peace if possible ; and there was something honourable and valuable in the strong domestic habits , the all - sufficiency of home to himself , whence resulted her brother ' s disposition to look down on the common rate of social intercourse , and those to whom it was important .-- It had a high claim to forbearance ."
austen#CHAPTER XII Mr . Knightley was to dine with them -- rather against the inclination of Mr . Woodhouse , who did not like that any one should share with him in Isabella ' s first day . Emma ' s sense of right however had decided it ; and besides the consideration of what was due to each brother , she had particular pleasure , from the circumstance of the late disagreement between Mr . Knightley and herself , in procuring him the proper invitation . She hoped they might now become friends again . She thought it was time to make up . Making - up indeed would not do .
austen#"_She_ certainly had not been in the wrong , and _he_ would never own that he had . Concession must be out of the question ; but it was time to appear to forget that they had ever quarrelled ; and she hoped it might rather assist the restoration of friendship , that when he came into the room she had one of the children with her -- the youngest , a nice little girl about eight months old , who was now making her first visit to Hartfield , and very happy to be danced about in her aunt ' s arms . It did assist ; for though he began with grave looks and short questions , he was soon led on to talk of them all in the usual way , and to take the child out of her arms with all the unceremoniousness of perfect amity . Emma felt they were friends again ; and the conviction giving her at first great satisfaction , and then a little sauciness , she could not help saying , as he was admiring the baby , "" What a comfort it is , that we think alike about our nephews and nieces . As to men and women , our opinions are sometimes very different ; but with regard to these children , I observe we never disagree ."""
austen#""" If you were as much guided by nature in your estimate of men and women , and as little under the power of fancy and whim in your dealings with them , as you are where these children are concerned , we might always think alike ."" "" To be sure -- our discordancies must always arise from my being in the wrong ."" "" Yes ,"" said he , smiling --"" and reason good . I was sixteen years old when you were born ."" "" A material difference then ,"" she replied --"" and no doubt you were much my superior in judgment at that period of our lives ; but does not the lapse of one - and - twenty years bring our understandings a good deal nearer ?"" "" Yes -- a good deal _nearer_ ."""
austen#""" But still , not near enough to give me a chance of being right , if we think differently ."" "" I have still the advantage of you by sixteen years ' experience , and by not being a pretty young woman and a spoiled child . Come , my dear Emma , let us be friends , and say no more about it . Tell your aunt , little Emma , that she ought to set you a better example than to be renewing old grievances , and that if she were not wrong before , she is now ."" "" That ' s true ,"" she cried --"" very true . Little Emma , grow up a better woman than your aunt ."
austen#"Be infinitely cleverer and not half so conceited . Now , Mr . Knightley , a word or two more , and I have done . As far as good intentions went , we were _both_ right , and I must say that no effects on my side of the argument have yet proved wrong . I only want to know that Mr . Martin is not very , very bitterly disappointed ."" "" A man cannot be more so ,"" was his short , full answer . "" Ah !-- Indeed I am very sorry .-- Come , shake hands with me ."""
austen#"This had just taken place and with great cordiality , when John Knightley made his appearance , and "" How d ' ye do , George ?"" and "" John , how are you ?"" succeeded in the true English style , burying under a calmness that seemed all but indifference , the real attachment which would have led either of them , if requisite , to do every thing for the good of the other . The evening was quiet and conversable , as Mr . Woodhouse declined cards entirely for the sake of comfortable talk with his dear Isabella , and the little party made two natural divisions ; on one side he and his daughter ; on the other the two Mr . Knightleys ; their subjects totally distinct , or very rarely mixing -- and Emma only occasionally joining in one or the other . The brothers talked of their own concerns and pursuits , but principally of those of the elder , whose temper was by much the most communicative , and who was always the greater talker . As a magistrate , he had generally some point of law to consult John about , or , at least , some curious anecdote to give ; and as a farmer , as keeping in hand the home - farm at Donwell , he had to tell what every field was to bear next year , and to give all such local information as could not fail of being interesting to a brother whose home it had equally been the longest part of his life , and whose attachments were strong ."
austen#"The plan of a drain , the change of a fence , the felling of a tree , and the destination of every acre for wheat , turnips , or spring corn , was entered into with as much equality of interest by John , as his cooler manners rendered possible ; and if his willing brother ever left him any thing to inquire about , his inquiries even approached a tone of eagerness . While they were thus comfortably occupied , Mr . Woodhouse was enjoying a full flow of happy regrets and fearful affection with his daughter . "" My poor dear Isabella ,"" said he , fondly taking her hand , and interrupting , for a few moments , her busy labours for some one of her five children --"" How long it is , how terribly long since you were here ! And how tired you must be after your journey ! You must go to bed early , my dear -- and I recommend a little gruel to you before you go .-- You and I will have a nice basin of gruel together . My dear Emma , suppose we all have a little gruel ."""
austen#"Emma could not suppose any such thing , knowing as she did , that both the Mr . Knightleys were as unpersuadable on that article as herself ;-- and two basins only were ordered . After a little more discourse in praise of gruel , with some wondering at its not being taken every evening by every body , he proceeded to say , with an air of grave reflection , "" It was an awkward business , my dear , your spending the autumn at South End instead of coming here . I never had much opinion of the sea air ."" "" Mr . Wingfield most strenuously recommended it , sir -- or we should not have gone . He recommended it for all the children , but particularly for the weakness in little Bella ' s throat ,-- both sea air and bathing ."""
austen#""" Ah ! my dear , but Perry had many doubts about the sea doing her any good ; and as to myself , I have been long perfectly convinced , though perhaps I never told you so before , that the sea is very rarely of use to any body . I am sure it almost killed me once ."" "" Come , come ,"" cried Emma , feeling this to be an unsafe subject , "" I must beg you not to talk of the sea . It makes me envious and miserable ;-- I who have never seen it ! South End is prohibited , if you please ."
austen#"My dear Isabella , I have not heard you make one inquiry about Mr . Perry yet ; and he never forgets you ."" "" Oh ! good Mr . Perry -- how is he , sir ?"" "" Why , pretty well ; but not quite well . Poor Perry is bilious , and he has not time to take care of himself -- he tells me he has not time to take care of himself -- which is very sad -- but he is always wanted all round the country . I suppose there is not a man in such practice anywhere ."
austen#"But then there is not so clever a man any where ."" "" And Mrs . Perry and the children , how are they ? do the children grow ? I have a great regard for Mr . Perry . I hope he will be calling soon . He will be so pleased to see my little ones ."""
austen#""" I hope he will be here to - morrow , for I have a question or two to ask him about myself of some consequence . And , my dear , whenever he comes , you had better let him look at little Bella ' s throat ."" "" Oh ! my dear sir , her throat is so much better that I have hardly any uneasiness about it . Either bathing has been of the greatest service to her , or else it is to be attributed to an excellent embrocation of Mr . Wingfield ' s , which we have been applying at times ever since August ."" "" It is not very likely , my dear , that bathing should have been of use to her -- and if I had known you were wanting an embrocation , I would have spoken to --"
austen#""" You seem to me to have forgotten Mrs . and Miss Bates ,"" said Emma , "" I have not heard one inquiry after them ."" "" Oh ! the good Bateses -- I am quite ashamed of myself -- but you mention them in most of your letters . I hope they are quite well . Good old Mrs . Bates -- I will call upon her to - morrow , and take my children .-- They are always so pleased to see my children .-- And that excellent Miss Bates !-- such thorough worthy people !-- How are they , sir ?"" "" Why , pretty well , my dear , upon the whole ."
austen#"But poor Mrs . Bates had a bad cold about a month ago ."" "" How sorry I am ! But colds were never so prevalent as they have been this autumn . Mr . Wingfield told me that he has never known them more general or heavy -- except when it has been quite an influenza ."" "" That has been a good deal the case , my dear ; but not to the degree you mention . Perry says that colds have been very general , but not so heavy as he has very often known them in November ."
austen#"Perry does not call it altogether a sickly season ."" "" No , I do not know that Mr . Wingfield considers it _very_ sickly except -- "" Ah ! my poor dear child , the truth is , that in London it is always a sickly season . Nobody is healthy in London , nobody can be . It is a dreadful thing to have you forced to live there !"
austen#"so far off !-- and the air so bad !"" "" No , indeed -- _we_ are not at all in a bad air . Our part of London is very superior to most others !-- You must not confound us with London in general , my dear sir . The neighbourhood of Brunswick Square is very different from almost all the rest . We are so very airy ! I should be unwilling , I own , to live in any other part of the town ;-- there is hardly any other that I could be satisfied to have my children in : but _we_ are so remarkably airy !-- Mr ."
austen#"Wingfield thinks the vicinity of Brunswick Square decidedly the most favourable as to air ."" "" Ah ! my dear , it is not like Hartfield . You make the best of it -- but after you have been a week at Hartfield , you are all of you different creatures ; you do not look like the same . Now I cannot say , that I think you are any of you looking well at present ."" "" I am sorry to hear you say so , sir ; but I assure you , excepting those little nervous head - aches and palpitations which I am never entirely free from anywhere , I am quite well myself ; and if the children were rather pale before they went to bed , it was only because they were a little more tired than usual , from their journey and the happiness of coming ."
austen#"I hope you will think better of their looks to - morrow ; for I assure you Mr . Wingfield told me , that he did not believe he had ever sent us off altogether , in such good case . I trust , at least , that you do not think Mr . Knightley looking ill ,"" turning her eyes with affectionate anxiety towards her husband . "" Middling , my dear ; I cannot compliment you . I think Mr . John Knightley very far from looking well ."" "" What is the matter , sir ?-- Did you speak to me ?"" cried Mr . John Knightley , hearing his own name ."
austen#""" I am sorry to find , my love , that my father does not think you looking well -- but I hope it is only from being a little fatigued . I could have wished , however , as you know , that you had seen Mr . Wingfield before you left home ."" "" My dear Isabella ,""-- exclaimed he hastily --"" pray do not concern yourself about my looks . Be satisfied with doctoring and coddling yourself and the children , and let me look as I chuse ."" "" I did not thoroughly understand what you were telling your brother ,"" cried Emma , "" about your friend Mr . Graham ' s intending to have a bailiff from Scotland , to look after his new estate . What will it answer ?"
austen#"Will not the old prejudice be too strong ?"" And she talked in this way so long and successfully that , when forced to give her attention again to her father and sister , she had nothing worse to hear than Isabella ' s kind inquiry after Jane Fairfax ; and Jane Fairfax , though no great favourite with her in general , she was at that moment very happy to assist in praising . "" That sweet , amiable Jane Fairfax !"" said Mrs . John Knightley .-- "" It is so long since I have seen her , except now and then for a moment accidentally in town ! What happiness it must be to her good old grandmother and excellent aunt , when she comes to visit them ! I always regret excessively on dear Emma ' s account that she cannot be more at Highbury ; but now their daughter is married , I suppose Colonel and Mrs . Campbell will not be able to part with her at all ."
austen#"She would be such a delightful companion for Emma ."" Mr . Woodhouse agreed to it all , but added , "" Our little friend Harriet Smith , however , is just such another pretty kind of young person . You will like Harriet . Emma could not have a better companion than Harriet ."" "" I am most happy to hear it -- but only Jane Fairfax one knows to be so very accomplished and superior !-- and exactly Emma ' s age ."""
austen#"This topic was discussed very happily , and others succeeded of similar moment , and passed away with similar harmony ; but the evening did not close without a little return of agitation . The gruel came and supplied a great deal to be said -- much praise and many comments -- undoubting decision of its wholesomeness for every constitution , and pretty severe Philippics upon the many houses where it was never met with tolerable ;-- but , unfortunately , among the failures which the daughter had to instance , the most recent , and therefore most prominent , was in her own cook at South End , a young woman hired for the time , who never had been able to understand what she meant by a basin of nice smooth gruel , thin , but not too thin . Often as she had wished for and ordered it , she had never been able to get any thing tolerable . Here was a dangerous opening . "" Ah !"" said Mr . Woodhouse , shaking his head and fixing his eyes on her with tender concern .-- The ejaculation in Emma ' s ear expressed , "" Ah !"
austen#"there is no end of the sad consequences of your going to South End . It does not bear talking of ."" And for a little while she hoped he would not talk of it , and that a silent rumination might suffice to restore him to the relish of his own smooth gruel . After an interval of some minutes , however , he began with , "" I shall always be very sorry that you went to the sea this autumn , instead of coming here ."" "" But why should you be sorry , sir ?-- I assure you , it did the children a great deal of good ."""
austen#""" And , moreover , if you must go to the sea , it had better not have been to South End . South End is an unhealthy place . Perry was surprized to hear you had fixed upon South End ."" "" I know there is such an idea with many people , but indeed it is quite a mistake , sir .-- We all had our health perfectly well there , never found the least inconvenience from the mud ; and Mr . Wingfield says it is entirely a mistake to suppose the place unhealthy ; and I am sure he may be depended on , for he thoroughly understands the nature of the air , and his own brother and family have been there repeatedly ."" "" You should have gone to Cromer , my dear , if you went anywhere .-- Perry was a week at Cromer once , and he holds it to be the best of all the sea - bathing places . A fine open sea , he says , and very pure air ."
austen#"And , by what I understand , you might have had lodgings there quite away from the sea -- a quarter of a mile off -- very comfortable . You should have consulted Perry ."" "" But , my dear sir , the difference of the journey ;-- only consider how great it would have been .-- An hundred miles , perhaps , instead of forty ."" "" Ah ! my dear , as Perry says , where health is at stake , nothing else should be considered ; and if one is to travel , there is not much to chuse between forty miles and an hundred .-- Better not move at all , better stay in London altogether than travel forty miles to get into a worse air . This is just what Perry said ."
austen#"It seemed to him a very ill - judged measure ."" Emma ' s attempts to stop her father had been vain ; and when he had reached such a point as this , she could not wonder at her brother - in - law ' s breaking out . "" Mr . Perry ,"" said he , in a voice of very strong displeasure , "" would do as well to keep his opinion till it is asked for . Why does he make it any business of his , to wonder at what I do ?-- at my taking my family to one part of the coast or another ?-- I may be allowed , I hope , the use of my judgment as well as Mr . Perry .-- I want his directions no more than his drugs ."" He paused -- and growing cooler in a moment , added , with only sarcastic dryness , "" If Mr . Perry can tell me how to convey a wife and five children a distance of an hundred and thirty miles with no greater expense or inconvenience than a distance of forty , I should be as willing to prefer Cromer to South End as he could himself ."""
austen#""" True , true ,"" cried Mr . Knightley , with most ready interposition -- "" very true . That ' s a consideration indeed .-- But John , as to what I was telling you of my idea of moving the path to Langham , of turning it more to the right that it may not cut through the home meadows , I cannot conceive any difficulty . I should not attempt it , if it were to be the means of inconvenience to the Highbury people , but if you call to mind exactly the present line of the path . . . ."
austen#"The only way of proving it , however , will be to turn to our maps . I shall see you at the Abbey to - morrow morning I hope , and then we will look them over , and you shall give me your opinion ."" Mr . Woodhouse was rather agitated by such harsh reflections on his friend Perry , to whom he had , in fact , though unconsciously , been attributing many of his own feelings and expressions ;-- but the soothing attentions of his daughters gradually removed the present evil , and the immediate alertness of one brother , and better recollections of the other , prevented any renewal of it . CHAPTER XIII There could hardly be a happier creature in the world than Mrs . John Knightley , in this short visit to Hartfield , going about every morning among her old acquaintance with her five children , and talking over what she had done every evening with her father and sister . She had nothing to wish otherwise , but that the days did not pass so swiftly ."
austen#It was a delightful visit ;-- perfect , in being much too short . In general their evenings were less engaged with friends than their mornings ; but one complete dinner engagement , and out of the house too , there was no avoiding , though at Christmas . Mr . Weston would take no denial ; they must all dine at Randalls one day ;-- even Mr . Woodhouse was persuaded to think it a possible thing in preference to a division of the party . How they were all to be conveyed , he would have made a difficulty if he could , but as his son and daughter ' s carriage and horses were actually at Hartfield , he was not able to make more than a simple question on that head ; it hardly amounted to a doubt ; nor did it occupy Emma long to convince him that they might in one of the carriages find room for Harriet also . Harriet , Mr . Elton , and Mr . Knightley , their own especial set , were the only persons invited to meet them ;-- the hours were to be early , as well as the numbers few ; Mr . Woodhouse ' s habits and inclination being consulted in every thing . The evening before this great event ( for it was a very great event that Mr . Woodhouse should dine out , on the 24th of December ) had been spent by Harriet at Hartfield , and she had gone home so much indisposed with a cold , that , but for her own earnest wish of being nursed by Mrs . Goddard , Emma could not have allowed her to leave the house .
austen#"Emma called on her the next day , and found her doom already signed with regard to Randalls . She was very feverish and had a bad sore throat : Mrs . Goddard was full of care and affection , Mr . Perry was talked of , and Harriet herself was too ill and low to resist the authority which excluded her from this delightful engagement , though she could not speak of her loss without many tears . Emma sat with her as long as she could , to attend her in Mrs . Goddard ' s unavoidable absences , and raise her spirits by representing how much Mr . Elton ' s would be depressed when he knew her state ; and left her at last tolerably comfortable , in the sweet dependence of his having a most comfortless visit , and of their all missing her very much . She had not advanced many yards from Mrs . Goddard ' s door , when she was met by Mr . Elton himself , evidently coming towards it , and as they walked on slowly together in conversation about the invalid -- of whom he , on the rumour of considerable illness , had been going to inquire , that he might carry some report of her to Hartfield -- they were overtaken by Mr . John Knightley returning from the daily visit to Donwell , with his two eldest boys , whose healthy , glowing faces shewed all the benefit of a country run , and seemed to ensure a quick despatch of the roast mutton and rice pudding they were hastening home for . They joined company and proceeded together . Emma was just describing the nature of her friend ' s complaint ;-- "" a throat very much inflamed , with a great deal of heat about her , a quick , low pulse , & c . and she was sorry to find from Mrs . Goddard that Harriet was liable to very bad sore - throats , and had often alarmed her with them ."""
austen#"Mr . Elton looked all alarm on the occasion , as he exclaimed , "" A sore - throat !-- I hope not infectious . I hope not of a putrid infectious sort . Has Perry seen her ? Indeed you should take care of yourself as well as of your friend . Let me entreat you to run no risks ."
austen#"Why does not Perry see her ?"" Emma , who was not really at all frightened herself , tranquillised this excess of apprehension by assurances of Mrs . Goddard ' s experience and care ; but as there must still remain a degree of uneasiness which she could not wish to reason away , which she would rather feed and assist than not , she added soon afterwards -- as if quite another subject , "" It is so cold , so very cold -- and looks and feels so very much like snow , that if it were to any other place or with any other party , I should really try not to go out to - day -- and dissuade my father from venturing ; but as he has made up his mind , and does not seem to feel the cold himself , I do not like to interfere , as I know it would be so great a disappointment to Mr . and Mrs . Weston . But , upon my word , Mr . Elton , in your case , I should certainly excuse myself . You appear to me a little hoarse already , and when you consider what demand of voice and what fatigues to - morrow will bring , I think it would be no more than common prudence to stay at home and take care of yourself to - night ."" Mr . Elton looked as if he did not very well know what answer to make ; which was exactly the case ; for though very much gratified by the kind care of such a fair lady , and not liking to resist any advice of her ' s , he had not really the least inclination to give up the visit ;-- but Emma , too eager and busy in her own previous conceptions and views to hear him impartially , or see him with clear vision , was very well satisfied with his muttering acknowledgment of its being "" very cold , certainly very cold ,"" and walked on , rejoicing in having extricated him from Randalls , and secured him the power of sending to inquire after Harriet every hour of the evening ."
austen#""" You do quite right ,"" said she ;--"" we will make your apologies to Mr . and Mrs . Weston ."" But hardly had she so spoken , when she found her brother was civilly offering a seat in his carriage , if the weather were Mr . Elton ' s only objection , and Mr . Elton actually accepting the offer with much prompt satisfaction . It was a done thing ; Mr . Elton was to go , and never had his broad handsome face expressed more pleasure than at this moment ; never had his smile been stronger , nor his eyes more exulting than when he next looked at her . "" Well ,"" said she to herself , "" this is most strange !-- After I had got him off so well , to chuse to go into company , and leave Harriet ill behind !-- Most strange indeed !-- But there is , I believe , in many men , especially single men , such an inclination -- such a passion for dining out -- a dinner engagement is so high in the class of their pleasures , their employments , their dignities , almost their duties , that any thing gives way to it -- and this must be the case with Mr . Elton ; a most valuable , amiable , pleasing young man undoubtedly , and very much in love with Harriet ; but still , he cannot refuse an invitation , he must dine out wherever he is asked . What a strange thing love is !"
austen#"he can see ready wit in Harriet , but will not dine alone for her ."" Soon afterwards Mr . Elton quitted them , and she could not but do him the justice of feeling that there was a great deal of sentiment in his manner of naming Harriet at parting ; in the tone of his voice while assuring her that he should call at Mrs . Goddard ' s for news of her fair friend , the last thing before he prepared for the happiness of meeting her again , when he hoped to be able to give a better report ; and he sighed and smiled himself off in a way that left the balance of approbation much in his favour . After a few minutes of entire silence between them , John Knightley began with -- "" I never in my life saw a man more intent on being agreeable than Mr . Elton . It is downright labour to him where ladies are concerned . With men he can be rational and unaffected , but when he has ladies to please , every feature works ."""
austen#""" Mr . Elton ' s manners are not perfect ,"" replied Emma ; "" but where there is a wish to please , one ought to overlook , and one does overlook a great deal . Where a man does his best with only moderate powers , he will have the advantage over negligent superiority . There is such perfect good - temper and good - will in Mr . Elton as one cannot but value ."" "" Yes ,"" said Mr . John Knightley presently , with some slyness , "" he seems to have a great deal of good - will towards you ."" "" Me !"" she replied with a smile of astonishment , "" are you imagining me to be Mr . Elton ' s object ?"""
austen#""" Such an imagination has crossed me , I own , Emma ; and if it never occurred to you before , you may as well take it into consideration now ."" "" Mr . Elton in love with me !-- What an idea !"" "" I do not say it is so ; but you will do well to consider whether it is so or not , and to regulate your behaviour accordingly . I think your manners to him encouraging . I speak as a friend , Emma . You had better look about you , and ascertain what you do , and what you mean to do ."""
austen#""" I thank you ; but I assure you you are quite mistaken . Mr . Elton and I are very good friends , and nothing more ;"" and she walked on , amusing herself in the consideration of the blunders which often arise from a partial knowledge of circumstances , of the mistakes which people of high pretensions to judgment are for ever falling into ; and not very well pleased with her brother for imagining her blind and ignorant , and in want of counsel . He said no more . Mr . Woodhouse had so completely made up his mind to the visit , that in spite of the increasing coldness , he seemed to have no idea of shrinking from it , and set forward at last most punctually with his eldest daughter in his own carriage , with less apparent consciousness of the weather than either of the others ; too full of the wonder of his own going , and the pleasure it was to afford at Randalls to see that it was cold , and too well wrapt up to feel it . The cold , however , was severe ; and by the time the second carriage was in motion , a few flakes of snow were finding their way down , and the sky had the appearance of being so overcharged as to want only a milder air to produce a very white world in a very short time . Emma soon saw that her companion was not in the happiest humour ."
austen#"The preparing and the going abroad in such weather , with the sacrifice of his children after dinner , were evils , were disagreeables at least , which Mr . John Knightley did not by any means like ; he anticipated nothing in the visit that could be at all worth the purchase ; and the whole of their drive to the vicarage was spent by him in expressing his discontent . "" A man ,"" said he , "" must have a very good opinion of himself when he asks people to leave their own fireside , and encounter such a day as this , for the sake of coming to see him . He must think himself a most agreeable fellow ; I could not do such a thing . It is the greatest absurdity -- Actually snowing at this moment !-- The folly of not allowing people to be comfortable at home -- and the folly of people ' s not staying comfortably at home when they can ! If we were obliged to go out such an evening as this , by any call of duty or business , what a hardship we should deem it ;-- and here are we , probably with rather thinner clothing than usual , setting forward voluntarily , without excuse , in defiance of the voice of nature , which tells man , in every thing given to his view or his feelings , to stay at home himself , and keep all under shelter that he can ;-- here are we setting forward to spend five dull hours in another man ' s house , with nothing to say or to hear that was not said and heard yesterday , and may not be said and heard again to - morrow . Going in dismal weather , to return probably in worse ;-- four horses and four servants taken out for nothing but to convey five idle , shivering creatures into colder rooms and worse company than they might have had at home ."""
austen#"Emma did not find herself equal to give the pleased assent , which no doubt he was in the habit of receiving , to emulate the "" Very true , my love ,"" which must have been usually administered by his travelling companion ; but she had resolution enough to refrain from making any answer at all . She could not be complying , she dreaded being quarrelsome ; her heroism reached only to silence . She allowed him to talk , and arranged the glasses , and wrapped herself up , without opening her lips . They arrived , the carriage turned , the step was let down , and Mr . Elton , spruce , black , and smiling , was with them instantly . Emma thought with pleasure of some change of subject . Mr . Elton was all obligation and cheerfulness ; he was so very cheerful in his civilities indeed , that she began to think he must have received a different account of Harriet from what had reached her ."
austen#"She had sent while dressing , and the answer had been , "" Much the same -- not better ."" "" _My_ report from Mrs . Goddard ' s ,"" said she presently , "" was not so pleasant as I had hoped --` Not better ' was _my_ answer ."" His face lengthened immediately ; and his voice was the voice of sentiment as he answered . "" Oh ! no -- I am grieved to find -- I was on the point of telling you that when I called at Mrs . Goddard ' s door , which I did the very last thing before I returned to dress , I was told that Miss Smith was not better , by no means better , rather worse . Very much grieved and concerned -- I had flattered myself that she must be better after such a cordial as I knew had been given her in the morning ."""
austen#"Emma smiled and answered --"" My visit was of use to the nervous part of her complaint , I hope ; but not even I can charm away a sore throat ; it is a most severe cold indeed . Mr . Perry has been with her , as you probably heard ."" "" Yes -- I imagined -- that is -- I did not --"" "" He has been used to her in these complaints , and I hope to - morrow morning will bring us both a more comfortable report . But it is impossible not to feel uneasiness . Such a sad loss to our party to - day !"""
austen#""" Dreadful !-- Exactly so , indeed .-- She will be missed every moment ."" This was very proper ; the sigh which accompanied it was really estimable ; but it should have lasted longer . Emma was rather in dismay when only half a minute afterwards he began to speak of other things , and in a voice of the greatest alacrity and enjoyment . "" What an excellent device ,"" said he , "" the use of a sheepskin for carriages . How very comfortable they make it ;-- impossible to feel cold with such precautions . The contrivances of modern days indeed have rendered a gentleman ' s carriage perfectly complete ."
austen#"One is so fenced and guarded from the weather , that not a breath of air can find its way unpermitted . Weather becomes absolutely of no consequence . It is a very cold afternoon -- but in this carriage we know nothing of the matter .-- Ha ! snows a little I see ."" "" Yes ,"" said John Knightley , "" and I think we shall have a good deal of it ."" "" Christmas weather ,"" observed Mr . Elton ."
austen#""" Quite seasonable ; and extremely fortunate we may think ourselves that it did not begin yesterday , and prevent this day ' s party , which it might very possibly have done , for Mr . Woodhouse would hardly have ventured had there been much snow on the ground ; but now it is of no consequence . This is quite the season indeed for friendly meetings . At Christmas every body invites their friends about them , and people think little of even the worst weather . I was snowed up at a friend ' s house once for a week . Nothing could be pleasanter . I went for only one night , and could not get away till that very day se ' nnight ."""
austen#"Mr . John Knightley looked as if he did not comprehend the pleasure , but said only , coolly , "" I cannot wish to be snowed up a week at Randalls ."" At another time Emma might have been amused , but she was too much astonished now at Mr . Elton ' s spirits for other feelings . Harriet seemed quite forgotten in the expectation of a pleasant party . "" We are sure of excellent fires ,"" continued he , "" and every thing in the greatest comfort . Charming people , Mr . and Mrs . Weston ;-- Mrs . Weston indeed is much beyond praise , and he is exactly what one values , so hospitable , and so fond of society ;-- it will be a small party , but where small parties are select , they are perhaps the most agreeable of any ."
austen#"Mr . Weston ' s dining - room does not accommodate more than ten comfortably ; and for my part , I would rather , under such circumstances , fall short by two than exceed by two . I think you will agree with me , ( turning with a soft air to Emma ,) I think I shall certainly have your approbation , though Mr . Knightley perhaps , from being used to the large parties of London , may not quite enter into our feelings ."" "" I know nothing of the large parties of London , sir -- I never dine with any body ."" "" Indeed ! ( in a tone of wonder and pity ,) I had no idea that the law had been so great a slavery . Well , sir , the time must come when you will be paid for all this , when you will have little labour and great enjoyment ."""
austen#""" My first enjoyment ,"" replied John Knightley , as they passed through the sweep - gate , "" will be to find myself safe at Hartfield again ."" CHAPTER XIV Some change of countenance was necessary for each gentleman as they walked into Mrs . Weston ' s drawing - room ;-- Mr . Elton must compose his joyous looks , and Mr . John Knightley disperse his ill - humour . Mr . Elton must smile less , and Mr . John Knightley more , to fit them for the place .-- Emma only might be as nature prompted , and shew herself just as happy as she was . To her it was real enjoyment to be with the Westons . Mr . Weston was a great favourite , and there was not a creature in the world to whom she spoke with such unreserve , as to his wife ; not any one , to whom she related with such conviction of being listened to and understood , of being always interesting and always intelligible , the little affairs , arrangements , perplexities , and pleasures of her father and herself ."
austen#She could tell nothing of Hartfield , in which Mrs . Weston had not a lively concern ; and half an hour ' s uninterrupted communication of all those little matters on which the daily happiness of private life depends , was one of the first gratifications of each . This was a pleasure which perhaps the whole day ' s visit might not afford , which certainly did not belong to the present half - hour ; but the very sight of Mrs . Weston , her smile , her touch , her voice was grateful to Emma , and she determined to think as little as possible of Mr . Elton ' s oddities , or of any thing else unpleasant , and enjoy all that was enjoyable to the utmost . The misfortune of Harriet ' s cold had been pretty well gone through before her arrival . Mr . Woodhouse had been safely seated long enough to give the history of it , besides all the history of his own and Isabella ' s coming , and of Emma ' s being to follow , and had indeed just got to the end of his satisfaction that James should come and see his daughter , when the others appeared , and Mrs . Weston , who had been almost wholly engrossed by her attentions to him , was able to turn away and welcome her dear Emma . Emma ' s project of forgetting Mr . Elton for a while made her rather sorry to find , when they had all taken their places , that he was close to her . The difficulty was great of driving his strange insensibility towards Harriet , from her mind , while he not only sat at her elbow , but was continually obtruding his happy countenance on her notice , and solicitously addressing her upon every occasion .
austen#"Instead of forgetting him , his behaviour was such that she could not avoid the internal suggestion of "" Can it really be as my brother imagined ? can it be possible for this man to be beginning to transfer his affections from Harriet to me ?-- Absurd and insufferable !"" -- Yet he would be so anxious for her being perfectly warm , would be so interested about her father , and so delighted with Mrs . Weston ; and at last would begin admiring her drawings with so much zeal and so little knowledge as seemed terribly like a would - be lover , and made it some effort with her to preserve her good manners . For her own sake she could not be rude ; and for Harriet ' s , in the hope that all would yet turn out right , she was even positively civil ; but it was an effort ; especially as something was going on amongst the others , in the most overpowering period of Mr . Elton ' s nonsense , which she particularly wished to listen to . She heard enough to know that Mr . Weston was giving some information about his son ; she heard the words "" my son ,"" and "" Frank ,"" and "" my son ,"" repeated several times over ; and , from a few other half - syllables very much suspected that he was announcing an early visit from his son ; but before she could quiet Mr . Elton , the subject was so completely past that any reviving question from her would have been awkward . Now , it so happened that in spite of Emma ' s resolution of never marrying , there was something in the name , in the idea of Mr . Frank Churchill , which always interested her ."
austen#She had frequently thought -- especially since his father ' s marriage with Miss Taylor -- that if she _were_ to marry , he was the very person to suit her in age , character and condition . He seemed by this connexion between the families , quite to belong to her . She could not but suppose it to be a match that every body who knew them must think of . That Mr . and Mrs . Weston did think of it , she was very strongly persuaded ; and though not meaning to be induced by him , or by any body else , to give up a situation which she believed more replete with good than any she could change it for , she had a great curiosity to see him , a decided intention of finding him pleasant , of being liked by him to a certain degree , and a sort of pleasure in the idea of their being coupled in their friends ' imaginations . With such sensations , Mr . Elton ' s civilities were dreadfully ill - timed ; but she had the comfort of appearing very polite , while feeling very cross -- and of thinking that the rest of the visit could not possibly pass without bringing forward the same information again , or the substance of it , from the open - hearted Mr . Weston .-- So it proved ;-- for when happily released from Mr . Elton , and seated by Mr . Weston , at dinner , he made use of the very first interval in the cares of hospitality , the very first leisure from the saddle of mutton , to say to her ,
austen#""" We want only two more to be just the right number . I should like to see two more here ,-- your pretty little friend , Miss Smith , and my son -- and then I should say we were quite complete . I believe you did not hear me telling the others in the drawing - room that we are expecting Frank . I had a letter from him this morning , and he will be with us within a fortnight ."" Emma spoke with a very proper degree of pleasure ; and fully assented to his proposition of Mr . Frank Churchill and Miss Smith making their party quite complete . "" He has been wanting to come to us ,"" continued Mr . Weston , "" ever since September : every letter has been full of it ; but he cannot command his own time ."
austen#"He has those to please who must be pleased , and who ( between ourselves ) are sometimes to be pleased only by a good many sacrifices . But now I have no doubt of seeing him here about the second week in January ."" "" What a very great pleasure it will be to you ! and Mrs . Weston is so anxious to be acquainted with him , that she must be almost as happy as yourself ."" "" Yes , she would be , but that she thinks there will be another put - off . She does not depend upon his coming so much as I do : but she does not know the parties so well as I do ."
austen#"The case , you see , is --( but this is quite between ourselves : I did not mention a syllable of it in the other room . There are secrets in all families , you know )-- The case is , that a party of friends are invited to pay a visit at Enscombe in January ; and that Frank ' s coming depends upon their being put off . If they are not put off , he cannot stir . But I know they will , because it is a family that a certain lady , of some consequence , at Enscombe , has a particular dislike to : and though it is thought necessary to invite them once in two or three years , they always are put off when it comes to the point . I have not the smallest doubt of the issue . I am as confident of seeing Frank here before the middle of January , as I am of being here myself : but your good friend there ( nodding towards the upper end of the table ) has so few vagaries herself , and has been so little used to them at Hartfield , that she cannot calculate on their effects , as I have been long in the practice of doing ."""
austen#""" I am sorry there should be any thing like doubt in the case ,"" replied Emma ; "" but am disposed to side with you , Mr . Weston . If you think he will come , I shall think so too ; for you know Enscombe ."" "" Yes -- I have some right to that knowledge ; though I have never been at the place in my life .-- She is an odd woman !-- But I never allow myself to speak ill of her , on Frank ' s account ; for I do believe her to be very fond of him . I used to think she was not capable of being fond of any body , except herself : but she has always been kind to him ( in her way -- allowing for little whims and caprices , and expecting every thing to be as she likes ). And it is no small credit , in my opinion , to him , that he should excite such an affection ; for , though I would not say it to any body else , she has no more heart than a stone to people in general ; and the devil of a temper ."" Emma liked the subject so well , that she began upon it , to Mrs . Weston , very soon after their moving into the drawing - room : wishing her joy -- yet observing , that she knew the first meeting must be rather alarming .-- Mrs . Weston agreed to it ; but added , that she should be very glad to be secure of undergoing the anxiety of a first meeting at the time talked of : "" for I cannot depend upon his coming ."
austen#"I cannot be so sanguine as Mr . Weston . I am very much afraid that it will all end in nothing . Mr . Weston , I dare say , has been telling you exactly how the matter stands ?"" "" Yes -- it seems to depend upon nothing but the ill - humour of Mrs . Churchill , which I imagine to be the most certain thing in the world ."" "" My Emma !"" replied Mrs . Weston , smiling , "" what is the certainty of caprice ?"""
austen#"Then turning to Isabella , who had not been attending before --"" You must know , my dear Mrs . Knightley , that we are by no means so sure of seeing Mr . Frank Churchill , in my opinion , as his father thinks . It depends entirely upon his aunt ' s spirits and pleasure ; in short , upon her temper . To you -- to my two daughters -- I may venture on the truth . Mrs . Churchill rules at Enscombe , and is a very odd - tempered woman ; and his coming now , depends upon her being willing to spare him ."" "" Oh , Mrs . Churchill ; every body knows Mrs . Churchill ,"" replied Isabella : "" and I am sure I never think of that poor young man without the greatest compassion . To be constantly living with an ill - tempered person , must be dreadful ."
austen#"It is what we happily have never known any thing of ; but it must be a life of misery . What a blessing , that she never had any children ! Poor little creatures , how unhappy she would have made them !"" Emma wished she had been alone with Mrs . Weston . She should then have heard more : Mrs . Weston would speak to her , with a degree of unreserve which she would not hazard with Isabella ; and , she really believed , would scarcely try to conceal any thing relative to the Churchills from her , excepting those views on the young man , of which her own imagination had already given her such instinctive knowledge . But at present there was nothing more to be said ."
austen#"Mr . Woodhouse very soon followed them into the drawing - room . To be sitting long after dinner , was a confinement that he could not endure . Neither wine nor conversation was any thing to him ; and gladly did he move to those with whom he was always comfortable . While he talked to Isabella , however , Emma found an opportunity of saying , "" And so you do not consider this visit from your son as by any means certain . I am sorry for it ."
austen#"The introduction must be unpleasant , whenever it takes place ; and the sooner it could be over , the better ."" "" Yes ; and every delay makes one more apprehensive of other delays . Even if this family , the Braithwaites , are put off , I am still afraid that some excuse may be found for disappointing us . I cannot bear to imagine any reluctance on his side ; but I am sure there is a great wish on the Churchills ' to keep him to themselves . There is jealousy . They are jealous even of his regard for his father ."
austen#"In short , I can feel no dependence on his coming , and I wish Mr . Weston were less sanguine ."" "" He ought to come ,"" said Emma . "" If he could stay only a couple of days , he ought to come ; and one can hardly conceive a young man ' s not having it in his power to do as much as that . A young _woman_ , if she fall into bad hands , may be teazed , and kept at a distance from those she wants to be with ; but one cannot comprehend a young _man_ ' s being under such restraint , as not to be able to spend a week with his father , if he likes it ."" "" One ought to be at Enscombe , and know the ways of the family , before one decides upon what he can do ,"" replied Mrs . Weston . "" One ought to use the same caution , perhaps , in judging of the conduct of any one individual of any one family ; but Enscombe , I believe , certainly must not be judged by general rules : _she_ is so very unreasonable ; and every thing gives way to her ."""
austen#""" But she is so fond of the nephew : he is so very great a favourite . Now , according to my idea of Mrs . Churchill , it would be most natural , that while she makes no sacrifice for the comfort of the husband , to whom she owes every thing , while she exercises incessant caprice towards _him_ , she should frequently be governed by the nephew , to whom she owes nothing at all ."" "" My dearest Emma , do not pretend , with your sweet temper , to understand a bad one , or to lay down rules for it : you must let it go its own way . I have no doubt of his having , at times , considerable influence ; but it may be perfectly impossible for him to know beforehand _when_ it will be ."" Emma listened , and then coolly said , "" I shall not be satisfied , unless he comes ."" "" He may have a great deal of influence on some points ,"" continued Mrs . Weston , "" and on others , very little : and among those , on which she is beyond his reach , it is but too likely , may be this very circumstance of his coming away from them to visit us ."""
austen#CHAPTER XV Mr . Woodhouse was soon ready for his tea ; and when he had drank his tea he was quite ready to go home ; and it was as much as his three companions could do , to entertain away his notice of the lateness of the hour , before the other gentlemen appeared . Mr . Weston was chatty and convivial , and no friend to early separations of any sort ; but at last the drawing - room party did receive an augmentation . Mr . Elton , in very good spirits , was one of the first to walk in . Mrs . Weston and Emma were sitting together on a sofa . He joined them immediately , and , with scarcely an invitation , seated himself between them .
austen#"Emma , in good spirits too , from the amusement afforded her mind by the expectation of Mr . Frank Churchill , was willing to forget his late improprieties , and be as well satisfied with him as before , and on his making Harriet his very first subject , was ready to listen with most friendly smiles . He professed himself extremely anxious about her fair friend -- her fair , lovely , amiable friend . "" Did she know ?-- had she heard any thing about her , since their being at Randalls ?-- he felt much anxiety -- he must confess that the nature of her complaint alarmed him considerably ."" And in this style he talked on for some time very properly , not much attending to any answer , but altogether sufficiently awake to the terror of a bad sore throat ; and Emma was quite in charity with him . But at last there seemed a perverse turn ; it seemed all at once as if he were more afraid of its being a bad sore throat on her account , than on Harriet ' s -- more anxious that she should escape the infection , than that there should be no infection in the complaint . He began with great earnestness to entreat her to refrain from visiting the sick - chamber again , for the present -- to entreat her to _promise_ _him_ not to venture into such hazard till he had seen Mr . Perry and learnt his opinion ; and though she tried to laugh it off and bring the subject back into its proper course , there was no putting an end to his extreme solicitude about her ."
austen#"She was vexed . It did appear -- there was no concealing it -- exactly like the pretence of being in love with her , instead of Harriet ; an inconstancy , if real , the most contemptible and abominable ! and she had difficulty in behaving with temper . He turned to Mrs . Weston to implore her assistance , "" Would not she give him her support ?-- would not she add her persuasions to his , to induce Miss Woodhouse not to go to Mrs . Goddard ' s till it were certain that Miss Smith ' s disorder had no infection ? He could not be satisfied without a promise -- would not she give him her influence in procuring it ?"" "" So scrupulous for others ,"" he continued , "" and yet so careless for herself !"
austen#"She wanted me to nurse my cold by staying at home to - day , and yet will not promise to avoid the danger of catching an ulcerated sore throat herself . Is this fair , Mrs . Weston ?-- Judge between us . Have not I some right to complain ? I am sure of your kind support and aid ."" Emma saw Mrs . Weston ' s surprize , and felt that it must be great , at an address which , in words and manner , was assuming to himself the right of first interest in her ; and as for herself , she was too much provoked and offended to have the power of directly saying any thing to the purpose ."
austen#"She could only give him a look ; but it was such a look as she thought must restore him to his senses , and then left the sofa , removing to a seat by her sister , and giving her all her attention . She had not time to know how Mr . Elton took the reproof , so rapidly did another subject succeed ; for Mr . John Knightley now came into the room from examining the weather , and opened on them all with the information of the ground being covered with snow , and of its still snowing fast , with a strong drifting wind ; concluding with these words to Mr . Woodhouse : "" This will prove a spirited beginning of your winter engagements , sir . Something new for your coachman and horses to be making their way through a storm of snow ."" Poor Mr . Woodhouse was silent from consternation ; but every body else had something to say ; every body was either surprized or not surprized , and had some question to ask , or some comfort to offer . Mrs . Weston and Emma tried earnestly to cheer him and turn his attention from his son - in - law , who was pursuing his triumph rather unfeelingly ."
austen#""" I admired your resolution very much , sir ,"" said he , "" in venturing out in such weather , for of course you saw there would be snow very soon . Every body must have seen the snow coming on . I admired your spirit ; and I dare say we shall get home very well . Another hour or two ' s snow can hardly make the road impassable ; and we are two carriages ; if one is blown over in the bleak part of the common field there will be the other at hand . I dare say we shall be all safe at Hartfield before midnight ."" Mr . Weston , with triumph of a different sort , was confessing that he had known it to be snowing some time , but had not said a word , lest it should make Mr . Woodhouse uncomfortable , and be an excuse for his hurrying away ."
austen#"As to there being any quantity of snow fallen or likely to fall to impede their return , that was a mere joke ; he was afraid they would find no difficulty . He wished the road might be impassable , that he might be able to keep them all at Randalls ; and with the utmost good - will was sure that accommodation might be found for every body , calling on his wife to agree with him , that with a little contrivance , every body might be lodged , which she hardly knew how to do , from the consciousness of there being but two spare rooms in the house . "" What is to be done , my dear Emma ?-- what is to be done ?"" was Mr . Woodhouse ' s first exclamation , and all that he could say for some time . To her he looked for comfort ; and her assurances of safety , her representation of the excellence of the horses , and of James , and of their having so many friends about them , revived him a little . His eldest daughter ' s alarm was equal to his own ."
austen#"The horror of being blocked up at Randalls , while her children were at Hartfield , was full in her imagination ; and fancying the road to be now just passable for adventurous people , but in a state that admitted no delay , she was eager to have it settled , that her father and Emma should remain at Randalls , while she and her husband set forward instantly through all the possible accumulations of drifted snow that might impede them . "" You had better order the carriage directly , my love ,"" said she ; "" I dare say we shall be able to get along , if we set off directly ; and if we do come to any thing very bad , I can get out and walk . I am not at all afraid . I should not mind walking half the way . I could change my shoes , you know , the moment I got home ; and it is not the sort of thing that gives me cold ."" "" Indeed !"""
austen#"replied he . "" Then , my dear Isabella , it is the most extraordinary sort of thing in the world , for in general every thing does give you cold . Walk home !-- you are prettily shod for walking home , I dare say . It will be bad enough for the horses ."" Isabella turned to Mrs . Weston for her approbation of the plan . Mrs . Weston could only approve ."
austen#"Isabella then went to Emma ; but Emma could not so entirely give up the hope of their being all able to get away ; and they were still discussing the point , when Mr . Knightley , who had left the room immediately after his brother ' s first report of the snow , came back again , and told them that he had been out of doors to examine , and could answer for there not being the smallest difficulty in their getting home , whenever they liked it , either now or an hour hence . He had gone beyond the sweep -- some way along the Highbury road -- the snow was nowhere above half an inch deep -- in many places hardly enough to whiten the ground ; a very few flakes were falling at present , but the clouds were parting , and there was every appearance of its being soon over . He had seen the coachmen , and they both agreed with him in there being nothing to apprehend . To Isabella , the relief of such tidings was very great , and they were scarcely less acceptable to Emma on her father ' s account , who was immediately set as much at ease on the subject as his nervous constitution allowed ; but the alarm that had been raised could not be appeased so as to admit of any comfort for him while he continued at Randalls . He was satisfied of there being no present danger in returning home , but no assurances could convince him that it was safe to stay ; and while the others were variously urging and recommending , Mr . Knightley and Emma settled it in a few brief sentences : thus -- "" Your father will not be easy ; why do not you go ?"""
austen#""" I am ready , if the others are ."" "" Shall I ring the bell ?"" "" Yes , do ."" And the bell was rung , and the carriages spoken for . A few minutes more , and Emma hoped to see one troublesome companion deposited in his own house , to get sober and cool , and the other recover his temper and happiness when this visit of hardship were over . The carriage came : and Mr . Woodhouse , always the first object on such occasions , was carefully attended to his own by Mr . Knightley and Mr . Weston ; but not all that either could say could prevent some renewal of alarm at the sight of the snow which had actually fallen , and the discovery of a much darker night than he had been prepared for ."
austen#""" He was afraid they should have a very bad drive . He was afraid poor Isabella would not like it . And there would be poor Emma in the carriage behind . He did not know what they had best do . They must keep as much together as they could ;"" and James was talked to , and given a charge to go very slow and wait for the other carriage . Isabella stept in after her father ; John Knightley , forgetting that he did not belong to their party , stept in after his wife very naturally ; so that Emma found , on being escorted and followed into the second carriage by Mr . Elton , that the door was to be lawfully shut on them , and that they were to have a tete - a - tete drive ."
austen#It would not have been the awkwardness of a moment , it would have been rather a pleasure , previous to the suspicions of this very day ; she could have talked to him of Harriet , and the three - quarters of a mile would have seemed but one . But now , she would rather it had not happened . She believed he had been drinking too much of Mr . Weston ' s good wine , and felt sure that he would want to be talking nonsense . To restrain him as much as might be , by her own manners , she was immediately preparing to speak with exquisite calmness and gravity of the weather and the night ; but scarcely had she begun , scarcely had they passed the sweep - gate and joined the other carriage , than she found her subject cut up -- her hand seized -- her attention demanded , and Mr . Elton actually making violent love to her : availing himself of the precious opportunity , declaring sentiments which must be already well known , hoping -- fearing -- adoring -- ready to die if she refused him ; but flattering himself that his ardent attachment and unequalled love and unexampled passion could not fail of having some effect , and in short , very much resolved on being seriously accepted as soon as possible . It really was so . Without scruple -- without apology -- without much apparent diffidence , Mr . Elton , the lover of Harriet , was professing himself _her_ lover .
austen#"She tried to stop him ; but vainly ; he would go on , and say it all . Angry as she was , the thought of the moment made her resolve to restrain herself when she did speak . She felt that half this folly must be drunkenness , and therefore could hope that it might belong only to the passing hour . Accordingly , with a mixture of the serious and the playful , which she hoped would best suit his half and half state , she replied , "" I am very much astonished , Mr . Elton . This to _me_ !"
austen#"you forget yourself -- you take me for my friend -- any message to Miss Smith I shall be happy to deliver ; but no more of this to _me_ , if you please ."" "" Miss Smith !-- message to Miss Smith !-- What could she possibly mean !"" -- And he repeated her words with such assurance of accent , such boastful pretence of amazement , that she could not help replying with quickness , "" Mr . Elton , this is the most extraordinary conduct ! and I can account for it only in one way ; you are not yourself , or you could not speak either to me , or of Harriet , in such a manner . Command yourself enough to say no more , and I will endeavour to forget it ."""
austen#"But Mr . Elton had only drunk wine enough to elevate his spirits , not at all to confuse his intellects . He perfectly knew his own meaning ; and having warmly protested against her suspicion as most injurious , and slightly touched upon his respect for Miss Smith as her friend ,-- but acknowledging his wonder that Miss Smith should be mentioned at all ,-- he resumed the subject of his own passion , and was very urgent for a favourable answer . As she thought less of his inebriety , she thought more of his inconstancy and presumption ; and with fewer struggles for politeness , replied , "" It is impossible for me to doubt any longer . You have made yourself too clear . Mr . Elton , my astonishment is much beyond any thing I can express ."
austen#"After such behaviour , as I have witnessed during the last month , to Miss Smith -- such attentions as I have been in the daily habit of observing -- to be addressing me in this manner -- this is an unsteadiness of character , indeed , which I had not supposed possible ! Believe me , sir , I am far , very far , from gratified in being the object of such professions ."" "" Good Heaven !"" cried Mr . Elton , "" what can be the meaning of this ?-- Miss Smith !-- I never thought of Miss Smith in the whole course of my existence -- never paid her any attentions , but as your friend : never cared whether she were dead or alive , but as your friend . If she has fancied otherwise , her own wishes have misled her , and I am very sorry -- extremely sorry -- But , Miss Smith , indeed !-- Oh ! Miss Woodhouse !"
austen#who can think of Miss Smith , when Miss Woodhouse is near ! No , upon my honour , there is no unsteadiness of character . I have thought only of you . I protest against having paid the smallest attention to any one else . Every thing that I have said or done , for many weeks past , has been with the sole view of marking my adoration of yourself . You cannot really , seriously , doubt it .
austen#"No !--( in an accent meant to be insinuating )-- I am sure you have seen and understood me ."" It would be impossible to say what Emma felt , on hearing this -- which of all her unpleasant sensations was uppermost . She was too completely overpowered to be immediately able to reply : and two moments of silence being ample encouragement for Mr . Elton ' s sanguine state of mind , he tried to take her hand again , as he joyously exclaimed -- "" Charming Miss Woodhouse ! allow me to interpret this interesting silence . It confesses that you have long understood me ."""
austen#""" No , sir ,"" cried Emma , "" it confesses no such thing . So far from having long understood you , I have been in a most complete error with respect to your views , till this moment . As to myself , I am very sorry that you should have been giving way to any feelings -- Nothing could be farther from my wishes -- your attachment to my friend Harriet -- your pursuit of her , ( pursuit , it appeared ,) gave me great pleasure , and I have been very earnestly wishing you success : but had I supposed that she were not your attraction to Hartfield , I should certainly have thought you judged ill in making your visits so frequent . Am I to believe that you have never sought to recommend yourself particularly to Miss Smith ?-- that you have never thought seriously of her ?"" "" Never , madam ,"" cried he , affronted in his turn : "" never , I assure you . _I_ think seriously of Miss Smith !-- Miss Smith is a very good sort of girl ; and I should be happy to see her respectably settled ."
austen#"I wish her extremely well : and , no doubt , there are men who might not object to -- Every body has their level : but as for myself , I am not , I think , quite so much at a loss . I need not so totally despair of an equal alliance , as to be addressing myself to Miss Smith !-- No , madam , my visits to Hartfield have been for yourself only ; and the encouragement I received --"" "" Encouragement !-- I give you encouragement !-- Sir , you have been entirely mistaken in supposing it . I have seen you only as the admirer of my friend . In no other light could you have been more to me than a common acquaintance . I am exceedingly sorry : but it is well that the mistake ends where it does ."
austen#"Had the same behaviour continued , Miss Smith might have been led into a misconception of your views ; not being aware , probably , any more than myself , of the very great inequality which you are so sensible of . But , as it is , the disappointment is single , and , I trust , will not be lasting . I have no thoughts of matrimony at present ."" He was too angry to say another word ; her manner too decided to invite supplication ; and in this state of swelling resentment , and mutually deep mortification , they had to continue together a few minutes longer , for the fears of Mr . Woodhouse had confined them to a foot - pace . If there had not been so much anger , there would have been desperate awkwardness ; but their straightforward emotions left no room for the little zigzags of embarrassment . Without knowing when the carriage turned into Vicarage Lane , or when it stopped , they found themselves , all at once , at the door of his house ; and he was out before another syllable passed .-- Emma then felt it indispensable to wish him a good night ."
austen#"The compliment was just returned , coldly and proudly ; and , under indescribable irritation of spirits , she was then conveyed to Hartfield . There she was welcomed , with the utmost delight , by her father , who had been trembling for the dangers of a solitary drive from Vicarage Lane -- turning a corner which he could never bear to think of -- and in strange hands -- a mere common coachman -- no James ; and there it seemed as if her return only were wanted to make every thing go well : for Mr . John Knightley , ashamed of his ill - humour , was now all kindness and attention ; and so particularly solicitous for the comfort of her father , as to seem -- if not quite ready to join him in a basin of gruel -- perfectly sensible of its being exceedingly wholesome ; and the day was concluding in peace and comfort to all their little party , except herself .-- But her mind had never been in such perturbation ; and it needed a very strong effort to appear attentive and cheerful till the usual hour of separating allowed her the relief of quiet reflection . CHAPTER XVI The hair was curled , and the maid sent away , and Emma sat down to think and be miserable .-- It was a wretched business indeed !-- Such an overthrow of every thing she had been wishing for !-- Such a development of every thing most unwelcome !-- Such a blow for Harriet !-- that was the worst of all . Every part of it brought pain and humiliation , of some sort or other ; but , compared with the evil to Harriet , all was light ; and she would gladly have submitted to feel yet more mistaken -- more in error -- more disgraced by mis - judgment , than she actually was , could the effects of her blunders have been confined to herself . "" If I had not persuaded Harriet into liking the man , I could have borne any thing ."
austen#"He might have doubled his presumption to me -- but poor Harriet !"" How she could have been so deceived !-- He protested that he had never thought seriously of Harriet -- never ! She looked back as well as she could ; but it was all confusion . She had taken up the idea , she supposed , and made every thing bend to it . His manners , however , must have been unmarked , wavering , dubious , or she could not have been so misled . The picture !-- How eager he had been about the picture !-- and the charade !-- and an hundred other circumstances ;-- how clearly they had seemed to point at Harriet ."
austen#"To be sure , the charade , with its "" ready wit ""-- but then the "" soft eyes ""-- in fact it suited neither ; it was a jumble without taste or truth . Who could have seen through such thick - headed nonsense ? Certainly she had often , especially of late , thought his manners to herself unnecessarily gallant ; but it had passed as his way , as a mere error of judgment , of knowledge , of taste , as one proof among others that he had not always lived in the best society , that with all the gentleness of his address , true elegance was sometimes wanting ; but , till this very day , she had never , for an instant , suspected it to mean any thing but grateful respect to her as Harriet ' s friend . To Mr . John Knightley was she indebted for her first idea on the subject , for the first start of its possibility . There was no denying that those brothers had penetration . She remembered what Mr . Knightley had once said to her about Mr . Elton , the caution he had given , the conviction he had professed that Mr . Elton would never marry indiscreetly ; and blushed to think how much truer a knowledge of his character had been there shewn than any she had reached herself ."
austen#It was dreadfully mortifying ; but Mr . Elton was proving himself , in many respects , the very reverse of what she had meant and believed him ; proud , assuming , conceited ; very full of his own claims , and little concerned about the feelings of others . Contrary to the usual course of things , Mr . Elton ' s wanting to pay his addresses to her had sunk him in her opinion . His professions and his proposals did him no service . She thought nothing of his attachment , and was insulted by his hopes . He wanted to marry well , and having the arrogance to raise his eyes to her , pretended to be in love ; but she was perfectly easy as to his not suffering any disappointment that need be cared for . There had been no real affection either in his language or manners .
austen#Sighs and fine words had been given in abundance ; but she could hardly devise any set of expressions , or fancy any tone of voice , less allied with real love . She need not trouble herself to pity him . He only wanted to aggrandise and enrich himself ; and if Miss Woodhouse of Hartfield , the heiress of thirty thousand pounds , were not quite so easily obtained as he had fancied , he would soon try for Miss Somebody else with twenty , or with ten . But -- that he should talk of encouragement , should consider her as aware of his views , accepting his attentions , meaning ( in short ), to marry him !-- should suppose himself her equal in connexion or mind !-- look down upon her friend , so well understanding the gradations of rank below him , and be so blind to what rose above , as to fancy himself shewing no presumption in addressing her !-- It was most provoking . Perhaps it was not fair to expect him to feel how very much he was her inferior in talent , and all the elegancies of mind . The very want of such equality might prevent his perception of it ; but he must know that in fortune and consequence she was greatly his superior .
austen#He must know that the Woodhouses had been settled for several generations at Hartfield , the younger branch of a very ancient family -- and that the Eltons were nobody . The landed property of Hartfield certainly was inconsiderable , being but a sort of notch in the Donwell Abbey estate , to which all the rest of Highbury belonged ; but their fortune , from other sources , was such as to make them scarcely secondary to Donwell Abbey itself , in every other kind of consequence ; and the Woodhouses had long held a high place in the consideration of the neighbourhood which Mr . Elton had first entered not two years ago , to make his way as he could , without any alliances but in trade , or any thing to recommend him to notice but his situation and his civility .-- But he had fancied her in love with him ; that evidently must have been his dependence ; and after raving a little about the seeming incongruity of gentle manners and a conceited head , Emma was obliged in common honesty to stop and admit that her own behaviour to him had been so complaisant and obliging , so full of courtesy and attention , as ( supposing her real motive unperceived ) might warrant a man of ordinary observation and delicacy , like Mr . Elton , in fancying himself a very decided favourite . If _she_ had so misinterpreted his feelings , she had little right to wonder that _he_ , with self - interest to blind him , should have mistaken hers . The first error and the worst lay at her door . It was foolish , it was wrong , to take so active a part in bringing any two people together . It was adventuring too far , assuming too much , making light of what ought to be serious , a trick of what ought to be simple .
austen#"She was quite concerned and ashamed , and resolved to do such things no more . "" Here have I ,"" said she , "" actually talked poor Harriet into being very much attached to this man . She might never have thought of him but for me ; and certainly never would have thought of him with hope , if I had not assured her of his attachment , for she is as modest and humble as I used to think him . Oh ! that I had been satisfied with persuading her not to accept young Martin . There I was quite right ."
austen#"That was well done of me ; but there I should have stopped , and left the rest to time and chance . I was introducing her into good company , and giving her the opportunity of pleasing some one worth having ; I ought not to have attempted more . But now , poor girl , her peace is cut up for some time . I have been but half a friend to her ; and if she were _not_ to feel this disappointment so very much , I am sure I have not an idea of any body else who would be at all desirable for her ;-- William Coxe -- Oh ! no , I could not endure William Coxe -- a pert young lawyer ."" She stopt to blush and laugh at her own relapse , and then resumed a more serious , more dispiriting cogitation upon what had been , and might be , and must be ."
austen#The distressing explanation she had to make to Harriet , and all that poor Harriet would be suffering , with the awkwardness of future meetings , the difficulties of continuing or discontinuing the acquaintance , of subduing feelings , concealing resentment , and avoiding eclat , were enough to occupy her in most unmirthful reflections some time longer , and she went to bed at last with nothing settled but the conviction of her having blundered most dreadfully . To youth and natural cheerfulness like Emma ' s , though under temporary gloom at night , the return of day will hardly fail to bring return of spirits . The youth and cheerfulness of morning are in happy analogy , and of powerful operation ; and if the distress be not poignant enough to keep the eyes unclosed , they will be sure to open to sensations of softened pain and brighter hope . Emma got up on the morrow more disposed for comfort than she had gone to bed , more ready to see alleviations of the evil before her , and to depend on getting tolerably out of it . It was a great consolation that Mr . Elton should not be really in love with her , or so particularly amiable as to make it shocking to disappoint him -- that Harriet ' s nature should not be of that superior sort in which the feelings are most acute and retentive -- and that there could be no necessity for any body ' s knowing what had passed except the three principals , and especially for her father ' s being given a moment ' s uneasiness about it . These were very cheering thoughts ; and the sight of a great deal of snow on the ground did her further service , for any thing was welcome that might justify their all three being quite asunder at present .
austen#"The weather was most favourable for her ; though Christmas Day , she could not go to church . Mr . Woodhouse would have been miserable had his daughter attempted it , and she was therefore safe from either exciting or receiving unpleasant and most unsuitable ideas . The ground covered with snow , and the atmosphere in that unsettled state between frost and thaw , which is of all others the most unfriendly for exercise , every morning beginning in rain or snow , and every evening setting in to freeze , she was for many days a most honourable prisoner . No intercourse with Harriet possible but by note ; no church for her on Sunday any more than on Christmas Day ; and no need to find excuses for Mr . Elton ' s absenting himself . It was weather which might fairly confine every body at home ; and though she hoped and believed him to be really taking comfort in some society or other , it was very pleasant to have her father so well satisfied with his being all alone in his own house , too wise to stir out ; and to hear him say to Mr . Knightley , whom no weather could keep entirely from them ,-- "" Ah !"
austen#"Mr . Knightley , why do not you stay at home like poor Mr . Elton ?"" These days of confinement would have been , but for her private perplexities , remarkably comfortable , as such seclusion exactly suited her brother , whose feelings must always be of great importance to his companions ; and he had , besides , so thoroughly cleared off his ill - humour at Randalls , that his amiableness never failed him during the rest of his stay at Hartfield . He was always agreeable and obliging , and speaking pleasantly of every body . But with all the hopes of cheerfulness , and all the present comfort of delay , there was still such an evil hanging over her in the hour of explanation with Harriet , as made it impossible for Emma to be ever perfectly at ease . CHAPTER XVII"
austen#"Mr . and Mrs . John Knightley were not detained long at Hartfield . The weather soon improved enough for those to move who must move ; and Mr . Woodhouse having , as usual , tried to persuade his daughter to stay behind with all her children , was obliged to see the whole party set off , and return to his lamentations over the destiny of poor Isabella ;-- which poor Isabella , passing her life with those she doated on , full of their merits , blind to their faults , and always innocently busy , might have been a model of right feminine happiness . The evening of the very day on which they went brought a note from Mr . Elton to Mr . Woodhouse , a long , civil , ceremonious note , to say , with Mr . Elton ' s best compliments , "" that he was proposing to leave Highbury the following morning in his way to Bath ; where , in compliance with the pressing entreaties of some friends , he had engaged to spend a few weeks , and very much regretted the impossibility he was under , from various circumstances of weather and business , of taking a personal leave of Mr . Woodhouse , of whose friendly civilities he should ever retain a grateful sense -- and had Mr . Woodhouse any commands , should be happy to attend to them ."" Emma was most agreeably surprized .-- Mr . Elton ' s absence just at this time was the very thing to be desired . She admired him for contriving it , though not able to give him much credit for the manner in which it was announced ."
austen#Resentment could not have been more plainly spoken than in a civility to her father , from which she was so pointedly excluded . She had not even a share in his opening compliments .-- Her name was not mentioned ;-- and there was so striking a change in all this , and such an ill - judged solemnity of leave - taking in his graceful acknowledgments , as she thought , at first , could not escape her father ' s suspicion . It did , however .-- Her father was quite taken up with the surprize of so sudden a journey , and his fears that Mr . Elton might never get safely to the end of it , and saw nothing extraordinary in his language . It was a very useful note , for it supplied them with fresh matter for thought and conversation during the rest of their lonely evening . Mr . Woodhouse talked over his alarms , and Emma was in spirits to persuade them away with all her usual promptitude . She now resolved to keep Harriet no longer in the dark .
austen#She had reason to believe her nearly recovered from her cold , and it was desirable that she should have as much time as possible for getting the better of her other complaint before the gentleman ' s return . She went to Mrs . Goddard ' s accordingly the very next day , to undergo the necessary penance of communication ; and a severe one it was .-- She had to destroy all the hopes which she had been so industriously feeding -- to appear in the ungracious character of the one preferred -- and acknowledge herself grossly mistaken and mis - judging in all her ideas on one subject , all her observations , all her convictions , all her prophecies for the last six weeks . The confession completely renewed her first shame -- and the sight of Harriet ' s tears made her think that she should never be in charity with herself again . Harriet bore the intelligence very well -- blaming nobody -- and in every thing testifying such an ingenuousness of disposition and lowly opinion of herself , as must appear with particular advantage at that moment to her friend . Emma was in the humour to value simplicity and modesty to the utmost ; and all that was amiable , all that ought to be attaching , seemed on Harriet ' s side , not her own . Harriet did not consider herself as having any thing to complain of .
austen#The affection of such a man as Mr . Elton would have been too great a distinction .-- She never could have deserved him -- and nobody but so partial and kind a friend as Miss Woodhouse would have thought it possible . Her tears fell abundantly -- but her grief was so truly artless , that no dignity could have made it more respectable in Emma ' s eyes -- and she listened to her and tried to console her with all her heart and understanding -- really for the time convinced that Harriet was the superior creature of the two -- and that to resemble her would be more for her own welfare and happiness than all that genius or intelligence could do . It was rather too late in the day to set about being simple - minded and ignorant ; but she left her with every previous resolution confirmed of being humble and discreet , and repressing imagination all the rest of her life . Her second duty now , inferior only to her father ' s claims , was to promote Harriet ' s comfort , and endeavour to prove her own affection in some better method than by match - making . She got her to Hartfield , and shewed her the most unvarying kindness , striving to occupy and amuse her , and by books and conversation , to drive Mr . Elton from her thoughts . Time , she knew , must be allowed for this being thoroughly done ; and she could suppose herself but an indifferent judge of such matters in general , and very inadequate to sympathise in an attachment to Mr . Elton in particular ; but it seemed to her reasonable that at Harriet ' s age , and with the entire extinction of all hope , such a progress might be made towards a state of composure by the time of Mr . Elton ' s return , as to allow them all to meet again in the common routine of acquaintance , without any danger of betraying sentiments or increasing them .
austen#Harriet did think him all perfection , and maintained the non - existence of any body equal to him in person or goodness -- and did , in truth , prove herself more resolutely in love than Emma had foreseen ; but yet it appeared to her so natural , so inevitable to strive against an inclination of that sort _unrequited_ , that she could not comprehend its continuing very long in equal force . If Mr . Elton , on his return , made his own indifference as evident and indubitable as she could not doubt he would anxiously do , she could not imagine Harriet ' s persisting to place her happiness in the sight or the recollection of him . Their being fixed , so absolutely fixed , in the same place , was bad for each , for all three . Not one of them had the power of removal , or of effecting any material change of society . They must encounter each other , and make the best of it . Harriet was farther unfortunate in the tone of her companions at Mrs . Goddard ' s ; Mr . Elton being the adoration of all the teachers and great girls in the school ; and it must be at Hartfield only that she could have any chance of hearing him spoken of with cooling moderation or repellent truth .
austen#"Where the wound had been given , there must the cure be found if anywhere ; and Emma felt that , till she saw her in the way of cure , there could be no true peace for herself . CHAPTER XVIII Mr . Frank Churchill did not come . When the time proposed drew near , Mrs . Weston ' s fears were justified in the arrival of a letter of excuse . For the present , he could not be spared , to his "" very great mortification and regret ; but still he looked forward with the hope of coming to Randalls at no distant period ."" Mrs . Weston was exceedingly disappointed -- much more disappointed , in fact , than her husband , though her dependence on seeing the young man had been so much more sober : but a sanguine temper , though for ever expecting more good than occurs , does not always pay for its hopes by any proportionate depression ."
austen#It soon flies over the present failure , and begins to hope again . For half an hour Mr . Weston was surprized and sorry ; but then he began to perceive that Frank ' s coming two or three months later would be a much better plan ; better time of year ; better weather ; and that he would be able , without any doubt , to stay considerably longer with them than if he had come sooner . These feelings rapidly restored his comfort , while Mrs . Weston , of a more apprehensive disposition , foresaw nothing but a repetition of excuses and delays ; and after all her concern for what her husband was to suffer , suffered a great deal more herself . Emma was not at this time in a state of spirits to care really about Mr . Frank Churchill ' s not coming , except as a disappointment at Randalls . The acquaintance at present had no charm for her . She wanted , rather , to be quiet , and out of temptation ; but still , as it was desirable that she should appear , in general , like her usual self , she took care to express as much interest in the circumstance , and enter as warmly into Mr . and Mrs . Weston ' s disappointment , as might naturally belong to their friendship .
austen#"She was the first to announce it to Mr . Knightley ; and exclaimed quite as much as was necessary , ( or , being acting a part , perhaps rather more ,) at the conduct of the Churchills , in keeping him away . She then proceeded to say a good deal more than she felt , of the advantage of such an addition to their confined society in Surry ; the pleasure of looking at somebody new ; the gala - day to Highbury entire , which the sight of him would have made ; and ending with reflections on the Churchills again , found herself directly involved in a disagreement with Mr . Knightley ; and , to her great amusement , perceived that she was taking the other side of the question from her real opinion , and making use of Mrs . Weston ' s arguments against herself . "" The Churchills are very likely in fault ,"" said Mr . Knightley , coolly ; "" but I dare say he might come if he would ."" "" I do not know why you should say so . He wishes exceedingly to come ; but his uncle and aunt will not spare him ."" "" I cannot believe that he has not the power of coming , if he made a point of it ."
austen#"It is too unlikely , for me to believe it without proof ."" "" How odd you are ! What has Mr . Frank Churchill done , to make you suppose him such an unnatural creature ?"" "" I am not supposing him at all an unnatural creature , in suspecting that he may have learnt to be above his connexions , and to care very little for any thing but his own pleasure , from living with those who have always set him the example of it . It is a great deal more natural than one could wish , that a young man , brought up by those who are proud , luxurious , and selfish , should be proud , luxurious , and selfish too . If Frank Churchill had wanted to see his father , he would have contrived it between September and January ."
austen#"A man at his age -- what is he ?-- three or four - and - twenty -- cannot be without the means of doing as much as that . It is impossible ."" "" That ' s easily said , and easily felt by you , who have always been your own master . You are the worst judge in the world , Mr . Knightley , of the difficulties of dependence . You do not know what it is to have tempers to manage ."" "" It is not to be conceived that a man of three or four - and - twenty should not have liberty of mind or limb to that amount ."
austen#"He cannot want money -- he cannot want leisure . We know , on the contrary , that he has so much of both , that he is glad to get rid of them at the idlest haunts in the kingdom . We hear of him for ever at some watering - place or other . A little while ago , he was at Weymouth . This proves that he can leave the Churchills ."" "" Yes , sometimes he can ."""
austen#""" And those times are whenever he thinks it worth his while ; whenever there is any temptation of pleasure ."" "" It is very unfair to judge of any body ' s conduct , without an intimate knowledge of their situation . Nobody , who has not been in the interior of a family , can say what the difficulties of any individual of that family may be . We ought to be acquainted with Enscombe , and with Mrs . Churchill ' s temper , before we pretend to decide upon what her nephew can do . He may , at times , be able to do a great deal more than he can at others ."" "" There is one thing , Emma , which a man can always do , if he chuses , and that is , his duty ; not by manoeuvring and finessing , but by vigour and resolution ."
austen#"It is Frank Churchill ' s duty to pay this attention to his father . He knows it to be so , by his promises and messages ; but if he wished to do it , it might be done . A man who felt rightly would say at once , simply and resolutely , to Mrs . Churchill -- ` Every sacrifice of mere pleasure you will always find me ready to make to your convenience ; but I must go and see my father immediately . I know he would be hurt by my failing in such a mark of respect to him on the present occasion . I shall , therefore , set off to - morrow .' -- If he would say so to her at once , in the tone of decision becoming a man , there would be no opposition made to his going ."""
austen#""" No ,"" said Emma , laughing ; "" but perhaps there might be some made to his coming back again . Such language for a young man entirely dependent , to use !-- Nobody but you , Mr . Knightley , would imagine it possible . But you have not an idea of what is requisite in situations directly opposite to your own . Mr . Frank Churchill to be making such a speech as that to the uncle and aunt , who have brought him up , and are to provide for him !-- Standing up in the middle of the room , I suppose , and speaking as loud as he could !-- How can you imagine such conduct practicable ?"" "" Depend upon it , Emma , a sensible man would find no difficulty in it . He would feel himself in the right ; and the declaration -- made , of course , as a man of sense would make it , in a proper manner -- would do him more good , raise him higher , fix his interest stronger with the people he depended on , than all that a line of shifts and expedients can ever do ."
austen#"Respect would be added to affection . They would feel that they could trust him ; that the nephew who had done rightly by his father , would do rightly by them ; for they know , as well as he does , as well as all the world must know , that he ought to pay this visit to his father ; and while meanly exerting their power to delay it , are in their hearts not thinking the better of him for submitting to their whims . Respect for right conduct is felt by every body . If he would act in this sort of manner , on principle , consistently , regularly , their little minds would bend to his ."" "" I rather doubt that . You are very fond of bending little minds ; but where little minds belong to rich people in authority , I think they have a knack of swelling out , till they are quite as unmanageable as great ones ."
austen#"I can imagine , that if you , as you are , Mr . Knightley , were to be transported and placed all at once in Mr . Frank Churchill ' s situation , you would be able to say and do just what you have been recommending for him ; and it might have a very good effect . The Churchills might not have a word to say in return ; but then , you would have no habits of early obedience and long observance to break through . To him who has , it might not be so easy to burst forth at once into perfect independence , and set all their claims on his gratitude and regard at nought . He may have as strong a sense of what would be right , as you can have , without being so equal , under particular circumstances , to act up to it ."" "" Then it would not be so strong a sense . If it failed to produce equal exertion , it could not be an equal conviction ."""
austen#""" Oh , the difference of situation and habit ! I wish you would try to understand what an amiable young man may be likely to feel in directly opposing those , whom as child and boy he has been looking up to all his life ."" "" Our amiable young man is a very weak young man , if this be the first occasion of his carrying through a resolution to do right against the will of others . It ought to have been a habit with him by this time , of following his duty , instead of consulting expediency . I can allow for the fears of the child , but not of the man . As he became rational , he ought to have roused himself and shaken off all that was unworthy in their authority ."
austen#"He ought to have opposed the first attempt on their side to make him slight his father . Had he begun as he ought , there would have been no difficulty now ."" "" We shall never agree about him ,"" cried Emma ; "" but that is nothing extraordinary . I have not the least idea of his being a weak young man : I feel sure that he is not . Mr . Weston would not be blind to folly , though in his own son ; but he is very likely to have a more yielding , complying , mild disposition than would suit your notions of man ' s perfection . I dare say he has ; and though it may cut him off from some advantages , it will secure him many others ."""
austen#""" Yes ; all the advantages of sitting still when he ought to move , and of leading a life of mere idle pleasure , and fancying himself extremely expert in finding excuses for it . He can sit down and write a fine flourishing letter , full of professions and falsehoods , and persuade himself that he has hit upon the very best method in the world of preserving peace at home and preventing his father ' s having any right to complain . His letters disgust me ."" "" Your feelings are singular . They seem to satisfy every body else ."" "" I suspect they do not satisfy Mrs . Weston ."
austen#They hardly can satisfy a woman of her good sense and quick feelings : standing in a mother ' s place , but without a mother ' s affection to blind her . It is on her account that attention to Randalls is doubly due , and she must doubly feel the omission . Had she been a person of consequence herself , he would have come I dare say ; and it would not have signified whether he did or no . Can you think your friend behindhand in these sort of considerations ? Do you suppose she does not often say all this to herself ? No , Emma , your amiable young man can be amiable only in French , not in English .
austen#"He may be very ` aimable ,' have very good manners , and be very agreeable ; but he can have no English delicacy towards the feelings of other people : nothing really amiable about him ."" "" You seem determined to think ill of him ."" "" Me !-- not at all ,"" replied Mr . Knightley , rather displeased ; "" I do not want to think ill of him . I should be as ready to acknowledge his merits as any other man ; but I hear of none , except what are merely personal ; that he is well - grown and good - looking , with smooth , plausible manners ."" "" Well , if he have nothing else to recommend him , he will be a treasure at Highbury . We do not often look upon fine young men , well - bred and agreeable ."
austen#"We must not be nice and ask for all the virtues into the bargain . Cannot you imagine , Mr . Knightley , what a _sensation_ his coming will produce ? There will be but one subject throughout the parishes of Donwell and Highbury ; but one interest -- one object of curiosity ; it will be all Mr . Frank Churchill ; we shall think and speak of nobody else ."" "" You will excuse my being so much over - powered . If I find him conversable , I shall be glad of his acquaintance ; but if he is only a chattering coxcomb , he will not occupy much of my time or thoughts ."" "" My idea of him is , that he can adapt his conversation to the taste of every body , and has the power as well as the wish of being universally agreeable ."
austen#"To you , he will talk of farming ; to me , of drawing or music ; and so on to every body , having that general information on all subjects which will enable him to follow the lead , or take the lead , just as propriety may require , and to speak extremely well on each ; that is my idea of him ."" "" And mine ,"" said Mr . Knightley warmly , "" is , that if he turn out any thing like it , he will be the most insufferable fellow breathing ! What ! at three - and - twenty to be the king of his company -- the great man -- the practised politician , who is to read every body ' s character , and make every body ' s talents conduce to the display of his own superiority ; to be dispensing his flatteries around , that he may make all appear like fools compared with himself ! My dear Emma , your own good sense could not endure such a puppy when it came to the point ."" "" I will say no more about him ,"" cried Emma , "" you turn every thing to evil ."
austen#"We are both prejudiced ; you against , I for him ; and we have no chance of agreeing till he is really here ."" "" Prejudiced ! I am not prejudiced ."" "" But I am very much , and without being at all ashamed of it . My love for Mr . and Mrs . Weston gives me a decided prejudice in his favour ."" "" He is a person I never think of from one month ' s end to another ,"" said Mr . Knightley , with a degree of vexation , which made Emma immediately talk of something else , though she could not comprehend why he should be angry ."
austen#"To take a dislike to a young man , only because he appeared to be of a different disposition from himself , was unworthy the real liberality of mind which she was always used to acknowledge in him ; for with all the high opinion of himself , which she had often laid to his charge , she had never before for a moment supposed it could make him unjust to the merit of another . VOLUME II CHAPTER I Emma and Harriet had been walking together one morning , and , in Emma ' s opinion , had been talking enough of Mr . Elton for that day . She could not think that Harriet ' s solace or her own sins required more ; and she was therefore industriously getting rid of the subject as they returned ;-- but it burst out again when she thought she had succeeded , and after speaking some time of what the poor must suffer in winter , and receiving no other answer than a very plaintive -- "" Mr . Elton is so good to the poor !"" she found something else must be done ."
austen#They were just approaching the house where lived Mrs . and Miss Bates . She determined to call upon them and seek safety in numbers . There was always sufficient reason for such an attention ; Mrs . and Miss Bates loved to be called on , and she knew she was considered by the very few who presumed ever to see imperfection in her , as rather negligent in that respect , and as not contributing what she ought to the stock of their scanty comforts . She had had many a hint from Mr . Knightley and some from her own heart , as to her deficiency -- but none were equal to counteract the persuasion of its being very disagreeable ,-- a waste of time -- tiresome women -- and all the horror of being in danger of falling in with the second - rate and third - rate of Highbury , who were calling on them for ever , and therefore she seldom went near them . But now she made the sudden resolution of not passing their door without going in -- observing , as she proposed it to Harriet , that , as well as she could calculate , they were just now quite safe from any letter from Jane Fairfax . The house belonged to people in business .
austen#"Mrs . and Miss Bates occupied the drawing - room floor ; and there , in the very moderate - sized apartment , which was every thing to them , the visitors were most cordially and even gratefully welcomed ; the quiet neat old lady , who with her knitting was seated in the warmest corner , wanting even to give up her place to Miss Woodhouse , and her more active , talking daughter , almost ready to overpower them with care and kindness , thanks for their visit , solicitude for their shoes , anxious inquiries after Mr . Woodhouse ' s health , cheerful communications about her mother ' s , and sweet - cake from the beaufet --"" Mrs . Cole had just been there , just called in for ten minutes , and had been so good as to sit an hour with them , and _she_ had taken a piece of cake and been so kind as to say she liked it very much ; and , therefore , she hoped Miss Woodhouse and Miss Smith would do them the favour to eat a piece too ."" The mention of the Coles was sure to be followed by that of Mr . Elton . There was intimacy between them , and Mr . Cole had heard from Mr . Elton since his going away . Emma knew what was coming ; they must have the letter over again , and settle how long he had been gone , and how much he was engaged in company , and what a favourite he was wherever he went , and how full the Master of the Ceremonies ' ball had been ; and she went through it very well , with all the interest and all the commendation that could be requisite , and always putting forward to prevent Harriet ' s being obliged to say a word . This she had been prepared for when she entered the house ; but meant , having once talked him handsomely over , to be no farther incommoded by any troublesome topic , and to wander at large amongst all the Mistresses and Misses of Highbury , and their card - parties . She had not been prepared to have Jane Fairfax succeed Mr . Elton ; but he was actually hurried off by Miss Bates , she jumped away from him at last abruptly to the Coles , to usher in a letter from her niece ."
austen#""" Oh ! yes -- Mr . Elton , I understand -- certainly as to dancing -- Mrs . Cole was telling me that dancing at the rooms at Bath was -- Mrs . Cole was so kind as to sit some time with us , talking of Jane ; for as soon as she came in , she began inquiring after her , Jane is so very great a favourite there . Whenever she is with us , Mrs . Cole does not know how to shew her kindness enough ; and I must say that Jane deserves it as much as any body can . And so she began inquiring after her directly , saying , ` I know you cannot have heard from Jane lately , because it is not her time for writing ;' and when I immediately said , ` But indeed we have , we had a letter this very morning ,' I do not know that I ever saw any body more surprized . ` Have you , upon your honour ?' said she ; ` well , that is quite unexpected ."
austen#"Do let me hear what she says .'"" Emma ' s politeness was at hand directly , to say , with smiling interest -- "" Have you heard from Miss Fairfax so lately ? I am extremely happy . I hope she is well ?"" "" Thank you ."
austen#"You are so kind !"" replied the happily deceived aunt , while eagerly hunting for the letter .--"" Oh ! here it is . I was sure it could not be far off ; but I had put my huswife upon it , you see , without being aware , and so it was quite hid , but I had it in my hand so very lately that I was almost sure it must be on the table . I was reading it to Mrs . Cole , and since she went away , I was reading it again to my mother , for it is such a pleasure to her -- a letter from Jane -- that she can never hear it often enough ; so I knew it could not be far off , and here it is , only just under my huswife -- and since you are so kind as to wish to hear what she says ;-- but , first of all , I really must , in justice to Jane , apologise for her writing so short a letter -- only two pages you see -- hardly two -- and in general she fills the whole paper and crosses half . My mother often wonders that I can make it out so well ."
austen#"She often says , when the letter is first opened , ` Well , Hetty , now I think you will be put to it to make out all that checker - work '-- don ' t you , ma ' am ?-- And then I tell her , I am sure she would contrive to make it out herself , if she had nobody to do it for her -- every word of it -- I am sure she would pore over it till she had made out every word . And , indeed , though my mother ' s eyes are not so good as they were , she can see amazingly well still , thank God ! with the help of spectacles . It is such a blessing ! My mother ' s are really very good indeed . Jane often says , when she is here , ` I am sure , grandmama , you must have had very strong eyes to see as you do -- and so much fine work as you have done too !-- I only wish my eyes may last me as well .'"""
austen#"All this spoken extremely fast obliged Miss Bates to stop for breath ; and Emma said something very civil about the excellence of Miss Fairfax ' s handwriting . "" You are extremely kind ,"" replied Miss Bates , highly gratified ; "" you who are such a judge , and write so beautifully yourself . I am sure there is nobody ' s praise that could give us so much pleasure as Miss Woodhouse ' s . My mother does not hear ; she is a little deaf you know . Ma ' am ,"" addressing her , "" do you hear what Miss Woodhouse is so obliging to say about Jane ' s handwriting ?"" And Emma had the advantage of hearing her own silly compliment repeated twice over before the good old lady could comprehend it ."
austen#"She was pondering , in the meanwhile , upon the possibility , without seeming very rude , of making her escape from Jane Fairfax ' s letter , and had almost resolved on hurrying away directly under some slight excuse , when Miss Bates turned to her again and seized her attention . "" My mother ' s deafness is very trifling you see -- just nothing at all . By only raising my voice , and saying any thing two or three times over , she is sure to hear ; but then she is used to my voice . But it is very remarkable that she should always hear Jane better than she does me . Jane speaks so distinct ! However , she will not find her grandmama at all deafer than she was two years ago ; which is saying a great deal at my mother ' s time of life -- and it really is full two years , you know , since she was here ."
austen#"We never were so long without seeing her before , and as I was telling Mrs . Cole , we shall hardly know how to make enough of her now ."" "" Are you expecting Miss Fairfax here soon ?"" "" Oh yes ; next week ."" "" Indeed !-- that must be a very great pleasure ."" "" Thank you . You are very kind ."
austen#Yes , next week . Every body is so surprized ; and every body says the same obliging things . I am sure she will be as happy to see her friends at Highbury , as they can be to see her . Yes , Friday or Saturday ; she cannot say which , because Colonel Campbell will be wanting the carriage himself one of those days . So very good of them to send her the whole way ! But they always do , you know .
austen#"Oh yes , Friday or Saturday next . That is what she writes about . That is the reason of her writing out of rule , as we call it ; for , in the common course , we should not have heard from her before next Tuesday or Wednesday ."" "" Yes , so I imagined . I was afraid there could be little chance of my hearing any thing of Miss Fairfax to - day ."" "" So obliging of you !"
austen#No , we should not have heard , if it had not been for this particular circumstance , of her being to come here so soon . My mother is so delighted !-- for she is to be three months with us at least . Three months , she says so , positively , as I am going to have the pleasure of reading to you . The case is , you see , that the Campbells are going to Ireland . Mrs . Dixon has persuaded her father and mother to come over and see her directly . They had not intended to go over till the summer , but she is so impatient to see them again -- for till she married , last October , she was never away from them so much as a week , which must make it very strange to be in different kingdoms , I was going to say , but however different countries , and so she wrote a very urgent letter to her mother -- or her father , I declare I do not know which it was , but we shall see presently in Jane ' s letter -- wrote in Mr . Dixon ' s name as well as her own , to press their coming over directly , and they would give them the meeting in Dublin , and take them back to their country seat , Baly - craig , a beautiful place , I fancy .
austen#"Jane has heard a great deal of its beauty ; from Mr . Dixon , I mean -- I do not know that she ever heard about it from any body else ; but it was very natural , you know , that he should like to speak of his own place while he was paying his addresses -- and as Jane used to be very often walking out with them -- for Colonel and Mrs . Campbell were very particular about their daughter ' s not walking out often with only Mr . Dixon , for which I do not at all blame them ; of course she heard every thing he might be telling Miss Campbell about his own home in Ireland ; and I think she wrote us word that he had shewn them some drawings of the place , views that he had taken himself . He is a most amiable , charming young man , I believe . Jane was quite longing to go to Ireland , from his account of things ."" At this moment , an ingenious and animating suspicion entering Emma ' s brain with regard to Jane Fairfax , this charming Mr . Dixon , and the not going to Ireland , she said , with the insidious design of farther discovery , "" You must feel it very fortunate that Miss Fairfax should be allowed to come to you at such a time . Considering the very particular friendship between her and Mrs . Dixon , you could hardly have expected her to be excused from accompanying Colonel and Mrs ."
austen#"Campbell ."" "" Very true , very true , indeed . The very thing that we have always been rather afraid of ; for we should not have liked to have her at such a distance from us , for months together -- not able to come if any thing was to happen . But you see , every thing turns out for the best . They want her ( Mr . and Mrs . Dixon ) excessively to come over with Colonel and Mrs . Campbell ; quite depend upon it ; nothing can be more kind or pressing than their _joint_ invitation , Jane says , as you will hear presently ; Mr . Dixon does not seem in the least backward in any attention . He is a most charming young man ."
austen#"Ever since the service he rendered Jane at Weymouth , when they were out in that party on the water , and she , by the sudden whirling round of something or other among the sails , would have been dashed into the sea at once , and actually was all but gone , if he had not , with the greatest presence of mind , caught hold of her habit -- ( I can never think of it without trembling !) -- But ever since we had the history of that day , I have been so fond of Mr . Dixon !"" "" But , in spite of all her friends ' urgency , and her own wish of seeing Ireland , Miss Fairfax prefers devoting the time to you and Mrs . Bates ?"" "" Yes -- entirely her own doing , entirely her own choice ; and Colonel and Mrs . Campbell think she does quite right , just what they should recommend ; and indeed they particularly _wish_ her to try her native air , as she has not been quite so well as usual lately ."""
austen#""" I am concerned to hear of it . I think they judge wisely . But Mrs . Dixon must be very much disappointed . Mrs . Dixon , I understand , has no remarkable degree of personal beauty ; is not , by any means , to be compared with Miss Fairfax ."" "" Oh ! no ."
austen#"You are very obliging to say such things -- but certainly not . There is no comparison between them . Miss Campbell always was absolutely plain -- but extremely elegant and amiable ."" "" Yes , that of course ."" "" Jane caught a bad cold , poor thing ! so long ago as the 7th of November , ( as I am going to read to you ,) and has never been well since ."
austen#"A long time , is not it , for a cold to hang upon her ? She never mentioned it before , because she would not alarm us . Just like her ! so considerate !-- But however , she is so far from well , that her kind friends the Campbells think she had better come home , and try an air that always agrees with her ; and they have no doubt that three or four months at Highbury will entirely cure her -- and it is certainly a great deal better that she should come here , than go to Ireland , if she is unwell . Nobody could nurse her , as we should do ."" "" It appears to me the most desirable arrangement in the world ."""
austen#""" And so she is to come to us next Friday or Saturday , and the Campbells leave town in their way to Holyhead the Monday following -- as you will find from Jane ' s letter . So sudden !-- You may guess , dear Miss Woodhouse , what a flurry it has thrown me in ! If it was not for the drawback of her illness -- but I am afraid we must expect to see her grown thin , and looking very poorly . I must tell you what an unlucky thing happened to me , as to that . I always make a point of reading Jane ' s letters through to myself first , before I read them aloud to my mother , you know , for fear of there being any thing in them to distress her . Jane desired me to do it , so I always do : and so I began to - day with my usual caution ; but no sooner did I come to the mention of her being unwell , than I burst out , quite frightened , with ` Bless me !"
austen#poor Jane is ill !' -- which my mother , being on the watch , heard distinctly , and was sadly alarmed at . However , when I read on , I found it was not near so bad as I had fancied at first ; and I make so light of it now to her , that she does not think much about it . But I cannot imagine how I could be so off my guard . If Jane does not get well soon , we will call in Mr . Perry . The expense shall not be thought of ; and though he is so liberal , and so fond of Jane that I dare say he would not mean to charge any thing for attendance , we could not suffer it to be so , you know .
austen#"He has a wife and family to maintain , and is not to be giving away his time . Well , now I have just given you a hint of what Jane writes about , we will turn to her letter , and I am sure she tells her own story a great deal better than I can tell it for her ."" "" I am afraid we must be running away ,"" said Emma , glancing at Harriet , and beginning to rise --"" My father will be expecting us . I had no intention , I thought I had no power of staying more than five minutes , when I first entered the house . I merely called , because I would not pass the door without inquiring after Mrs . Bates ; but I have been so pleasantly detained ! Now , however , we must wish you and Mrs . Bates good morning ."""
austen#And not all that could be urged to detain her succeeded . She regained the street -- happy in this , that though much had been forced on her against her will , though she had in fact heard the whole substance of Jane Fairfax ' s letter , she had been able to escape the letter itself . CHAPTER II Jane Fairfax was an orphan , the only child of Mrs . Bates ' s youngest daughter . The marriage of Lieut . Fairfax of the _______ regiment of infantry , and Miss Jane Bates , had had its day of fame and pleasure , hope and interest ; but nothing now remained of it , save the melancholy remembrance of him dying in action abroad -- of his widow sinking under consumption and grief soon afterwards -- and this girl .
austen#By birth she belonged to Highbury : and when at three years old , on losing her mother , she became the property , the charge , the consolation , the fondling of her grandmother and aunt , there had seemed every probability of her being permanently fixed there ; of her being taught only what very limited means could command , and growing up with no advantages of connexion or improvement , to be engrafted on what nature had given her in a pleasing person , good understanding , and warm - hearted , well - meaning relations . But the compassionate feelings of a friend of her father gave a change to her destiny . This was Colonel Campbell , who had very highly regarded Fairfax , as an excellent officer and most deserving young man ; and farther , had been indebted to him for such attentions , during a severe camp - fever , as he believed had saved his life . These were claims which he did not learn to overlook , though some years passed away from the death of poor Fairfax , before his own return to England put any thing in his power . When he did return , he sought out the child and took notice of her . He was a married man , with only one living child , a girl , about Jane ' s age : and Jane became their guest , paying them long visits and growing a favourite with all ; and before she was nine years old , his daughter ' s great fondness for her , and his own wish of being a real friend , united to produce an offer from Colonel Campbell of undertaking the whole charge of her education .
austen#It was accepted ; and from that period Jane had belonged to Colonel Campbell ' s family , and had lived with them entirely , only visiting her grandmother from time to time . The plan was that she should be brought up for educating others ; the very few hundred pounds which she inherited from her father making independence impossible . To provide for her otherwise was out of Colonel Campbell ' s power ; for though his income , by pay and appointments , was handsome , his fortune was moderate and must be all his daughter ' s ; but , by giving her an education , he hoped to be supplying the means of respectable subsistence hereafter . Such was Jane Fairfax ' s history . She had fallen into good hands , known nothing but kindness from the Campbells , and been given an excellent education . Living constantly with right - minded and well - informed people , her heart and understanding had received every advantage of discipline and culture ; and Colonel Campbell ' s residence being in London , every lighter talent had been done full justice to , by the attendance of first - rate masters .
austen#Her disposition and abilities were equally worthy of all that friendship could do ; and at eighteen or nineteen she was , as far as such an early age can be qualified for the care of children , fully competent to the office of instruction herself ; but she was too much beloved to be parted with . Neither father nor mother could promote , and the daughter could not endure it . The evil day was put off . It was easy to decide that she was still too young ; and Jane remained with them , sharing , as another daughter , in all the rational pleasures of an elegant society , and a judicious mixture of home and amusement , with only the drawback of the future , the sobering suggestions of her own good understanding to remind her that all this might soon be over . The affection of the whole family , the warm attachment of Miss Campbell in particular , was the more honourable to each party from the circumstance of Jane ' s decided superiority both in beauty and acquirements . That nature had given it in feature could not be unseen by the young woman , nor could her higher powers of mind be unfelt by the parents .
austen#They continued together with unabated regard however , till the marriage of Miss Campbell , who by that chance , that luck which so often defies anticipation in matrimonial affairs , giving attraction to what is moderate rather than to what is superior , engaged the affections of Mr . Dixon , a young man , rich and agreeable , almost as soon as they were acquainted ; and was eligibly and happily settled , while Jane Fairfax had yet her bread to earn . This event had very lately taken place ; too lately for any thing to be yet attempted by her less fortunate friend towards entering on her path of duty ; though she had now reached the age which her own judgment had fixed on for beginning . She had long resolved that one - and - twenty should be the period . With the fortitude of a devoted novitiate , she had resolved at one - and - twenty to complete the sacrifice , and retire from all the pleasures of life , of rational intercourse , equal society , peace and hope , to penance and mortification for ever . The good sense of Colonel and Mrs . Campbell could not oppose such a resolution , though their feelings did . As long as they lived , no exertions would be necessary , their home might be hers for ever ; and for their own comfort they would have retained her wholly ; but this would be selfishness :-- what must be at last , had better be soon .
austen#Perhaps they began to feel it might have been kinder and wiser to have resisted the temptation of any delay , and spared her from a taste of such enjoyments of ease and leisure as must now be relinquished . Still , however , affection was glad to catch at any reasonable excuse for not hurrying on the wretched moment . She had never been quite well since the time of their daughter ' s marriage ; and till she should have completely recovered her usual strength , they must forbid her engaging in duties , which , so far from being compatible with a weakened frame and varying spirits , seemed , under the most favourable circumstances , to require something more than human perfection of body and mind to be discharged with tolerable comfort . With regard to her not accompanying them to Ireland , her account to her aunt contained nothing but truth , though there might be some truths not told . It was her own choice to give the time of their absence to Highbury ; to spend , perhaps , her last months of perfect liberty with those kind relations to whom she was so very dear : and the Campbells , whatever might be their motive or motives , whether single , or double , or treble , gave the arrangement their ready sanction , and said , that they depended more on a few months spent in her native air , for the recovery of her health , than on any thing else . Certain it was that she was to come ; and that Highbury , instead of welcoming that perfect novelty which had been so long promised it -- Mr . Frank Churchill -- must put up for the present with Jane Fairfax , who could bring only the freshness of a two years ' absence .
austen#"Emma was sorry ;-- to have to pay civilities to a person she did not like through three long months !-- to be always doing more than she wished , and less than she ought ! Why she did not like Jane Fairfax might be a difficult question to answer ; Mr . Knightley had once told her it was because she saw in her the really accomplished young woman , which she wanted to be thought herself ; and though the accusation had been eagerly refuted at the time , there were moments of self - examination in which her conscience could not quite acquit her . But "" she could never get acquainted with her : she did not know how it was , but there was such coldness and reserve -- such apparent indifference whether she pleased or not -- and then , her aunt was such an eternal talker !-- and she was made such a fuss with by every body !-- and it had been always imagined that they were to be so intimate -- because their ages were the same , every body had supposed they must be so fond of each other ."" These were her reasons -- she had no better . It was a dislike so little just -- every imputed fault was so magnified by fancy , that she never saw Jane Fairfax the first time after any considerable absence , without feeling that she had injured her ; and now , when the due visit was paid , on her arrival , after a two years ' interval , she was particularly struck with the very appearance and manners , which for those two whole years she had been depreciating . Jane Fairfax was very elegant , remarkably elegant ; and she had herself the highest value for elegance ."
austen#Her height was pretty , just such as almost every body would think tall , and nobody could think very tall ; her figure particularly graceful ; her size a most becoming medium , between fat and thin , though a slight appearance of ill - health seemed to point out the likeliest evil of the two . Emma could not but feel all this ; and then , her face -- her features -- there was more beauty in them altogether than she had remembered ; it was not regular , but it was very pleasing beauty . Her eyes , a deep grey , with dark eye - lashes and eyebrows , had never been denied their praise ; but the skin , which she had been used to cavil at , as wanting colour , had a clearness and delicacy which really needed no fuller bloom . It was a style of beauty , of which elegance was the reigning character , and as such , she must , in honour , by all her principles , admire it :-- elegance , which , whether of person or of mind , she saw so little in Highbury . There , not to be vulgar , was distinction , and merit . In short , she sat , during the first visit , looking at Jane Fairfax with twofold complacency ; the sense of pleasure and the sense of rendering justice , and was determining that she would dislike her no longer .
austen#When she took in her history , indeed , her situation , as well as her beauty ; when she considered what all this elegance was destined to , what she was going to sink from , how she was going to live , it seemed impossible to feel any thing but compassion and respect ; especially , if to every well - known particular entitling her to interest , were added the highly probable circumstance of an attachment to Mr . Dixon , which she had so naturally started to herself . In that case , nothing could be more pitiable or more honourable than the sacrifices she had resolved on . Emma was very willing now to acquit her of having seduced Mr . Dixon ' s actions from his wife , or of any thing mischievous which her imagination had suggested at first . If it were love , it might be simple , single , successless love on her side alone . She might have been unconsciously sucking in the sad poison , while a sharer of his conversation with her friend ; and from the best , the purest of motives , might now be denying herself this visit to Ireland , and resolving to divide herself effectually from him and his connexions by soon beginning her career of laborious duty . Upon the whole , Emma left her with such softened , charitable feelings , as made her look around in walking home , and lament that Highbury afforded no young man worthy of giving her independence ; nobody that she could wish to scheme about for her .
austen#"These were charming feelings -- but not lasting . Before she had committed herself by any public profession of eternal friendship for Jane Fairfax , or done more towards a recantation of past prejudices and errors , than saying to Mr . Knightley , "" She certainly is handsome ; she is better than handsome !"" Jane had spent an evening at Hartfield with her grandmother and aunt , and every thing was relapsing much into its usual state . Former provocations reappeared . The aunt was as tiresome as ever ; more tiresome , because anxiety for her health was now added to admiration of her powers ; and they had to listen to the description of exactly how little bread and butter she ate for breakfast , and how small a slice of mutton for dinner , as well as to see exhibitions of new caps and new workbags for her mother and herself ; and Jane ' s offences rose again . They had music ; Emma was obliged to play ; and the thanks and praise which necessarily followed appeared to her an affectation of candour , an air of greatness , meaning only to shew off in higher style her own very superior performance ."
austen#She was , besides , which was the worst of all , so cold , so cautious ! There was no getting at her real opinion . Wrapt up in a cloak of politeness , she seemed determined to hazard nothing . She was disgustingly , was suspiciously reserved . If any thing could be more , where all was most , she was more reserved on the subject of Weymouth and the Dixons than any thing . She seemed bent on giving no real insight into Mr . Dixon ' s character , or her own value for his company , or opinion of the suitableness of the match .
austen#It was all general approbation and smoothness ; nothing delineated or distinguished . It did her no service however . Her caution was thrown away . Emma saw its artifice , and returned to her first surmises . There probably _was_ something more to conceal than her own preference ; Mr . Dixon , perhaps , had been very near changing one friend for the other , or been fixed only to Miss Campbell , for the sake of the future twelve thousand pounds . The like reserve prevailed on other topics .
austen#"She and Mr . Frank Churchill had been at Weymouth at the same time . It was known that they were a little acquainted ; but not a syllable of real information could Emma procure as to what he truly was . "" Was he handsome ?"" --"" She believed he was reckoned a very fine young man ."" "" Was he agreeable ?"" -- "" He was generally thought so ."""
austen#""" Did he appear a sensible young man ; a young man of information ?"" --"" At a watering - place , or in a common London acquaintance , it was difficult to decide on such points . Manners were all that could be safely judged of , under a much longer knowledge than they had yet had of Mr . Churchill . She believed every body found his manners pleasing ."" Emma could not forgive her . CHAPTER III"
austen#"Emma could not forgive her ;-- but as neither provocation nor resentment were discerned by Mr . Knightley , who had been of the party , and had seen only proper attention and pleasing behaviour on each side , he was expressing the next morning , being at Hartfield again on business with Mr . Woodhouse , his approbation of the whole ; not so openly as he might have done had her father been out of the room , but speaking plain enough to be very intelligible to Emma . He had been used to think her unjust to Jane , and had now great pleasure in marking an improvement . "" A very pleasant evening ,"" he began , as soon as Mr . Woodhouse had been talked into what was necessary , told that he understood , and the papers swept away ;--"" particularly pleasant . You and Miss Fairfax gave us some very good music . I do not know a more luxurious state , sir , than sitting at one ' s ease to be entertained a whole evening by two such young women ; sometimes with music and sometimes with conversation . I am sure Miss Fairfax must have found the evening pleasant , Emma ."
austen#"You left nothing undone . I was glad you made her play so much , for having no instrument at her grandmother ' s , it must have been a real indulgence ."" "" I am happy you approved ,"" said Emma , smiling ; "" but I hope I am not often deficient in what is due to guests at Hartfield ."" "" No , my dear ,"" said her father instantly ; "" _that_ I am sure you are not . There is nobody half so attentive and civil as you are . If any thing , you are too attentive ."
austen#"The muffin last night -- if it had been handed round once , I think it would have been enough ."" "" No ,"" said Mr . Knightley , nearly at the same time ; "" you are not often deficient ; not often deficient either in manner or comprehension . I think you understand me , therefore ."" An arch look expressed --"" I understand you well enough ;"" but she said only , "" Miss Fairfax is reserved ."" "" I always told you she was -- a little ; but you will soon overcome all that part of her reserve which ought to be overcome , all that has its foundation in diffidence . What arises from discretion must be honoured ."""
austen#""" You think her diffident . I do not see it ."" "" My dear Emma ,"" said he , moving from his chair into one close by her , "" you are not going to tell me , I hope , that you had not a pleasant evening ."" "" Oh ! no ; I was pleased with my own perseverance in asking questions ; and amused to think how little information I obtained ."" "" I am disappointed ,"" was his only answer ."
austen#""" I hope every body had a pleasant evening ,"" said Mr . Woodhouse , in his quiet way . "" I had . Once , I felt the fire rather too much ; but then I moved back my chair a little , a very little , and it did not disturb me . Miss Bates was very chatty and good - humoured , as she always is , though she speaks rather too quick . However , she is very agreeable , and Mrs . Bates too , in a different way . I like old friends ; and Miss Jane Fairfax is a very pretty sort of young lady , a very pretty and a very well - behaved young lady indeed ."
austen#"She must have found the evening agreeable , Mr . Knightley , because she had Emma ."" "" True , sir ; and Emma , because she had Miss Fairfax ."" Emma saw his anxiety , and wishing to appease it , at least for the present , said , and with a sincerity which no one could question -- "" She is a sort of elegant creature that one cannot keep one ' s eyes from . I am always watching her to admire ; and I do pity her from my heart ."" Mr . Knightley looked as if he were more gratified than he cared to express ; and before he could make any reply , Mr . Woodhouse , whose thoughts were on the Bates ' s , said --"
austen#""" It is a great pity that their circumstances should be so confined ! a great pity indeed ! and I have often wished -- but it is so little one can venture to do -- small , trifling presents , of any thing uncommon -- Now we have killed a porker , and Emma thinks of sending them a loin or a leg ; it is very small and delicate -- Hartfield pork is not like any other pork -- but still it is pork -- and , my dear Emma , unless one could be sure of their making it into steaks , nicely fried , as ours are fried , without the smallest grease , and not roast it , for no stomach can bear roast pork -- I think we had better send the leg -- do not you think so , my dear ?"" "" My dear papa , I sent the whole hind - quarter . I knew you would wish it . There will be the leg to be salted , you know , which is so very nice , and the loin to be dressed directly in any manner they like ."""
austen#""" That ' s right , my dear , very right . I had not thought of it before , but that is the best way . They must not over - salt the leg ; and then , if it is not over - salted , and if it is very thoroughly boiled , just as Serle boils ours , and eaten very moderately of , with a boiled turnip , and a little carrot or parsnip , I do not consider it unwholesome ."" "" Emma ,"" said Mr . Knightley presently , "" I have a piece of news for you . You like news -- and I heard an article in my way hither that I think will interest you ."" "" News !"
austen#"Oh ! yes , I always like news . What is it ?-- why do you smile so ?-- where did you hear it ?-- at Randalls ?"" He had time only to say , "" No , not at Randalls ; I have not been near Randalls ,"" when the door was thrown open , and Miss Bates and Miss Fairfax walked into the room . Full of thanks , and full of news , Miss Bates knew not which to give quickest ."
austen#"Mr . Knightley soon saw that he had lost his moment , and that not another syllable of communication could rest with him . "" Oh ! my dear sir , how are you this morning ? My dear Miss Woodhouse -- I come quite over - powered . Such a beautiful hind - quarter of pork ! You are too bountiful !"
austen#"Have you heard the news ? Mr . Elton is going to be married ."" Emma had not had time even to think of Mr . Elton , and she was so completely surprized that she could not avoid a little start , and a little blush , at the sound . "" There is my news :-- I thought it would interest you ,"" said Mr . Knightley , with a smile which implied a conviction of some part of what had passed between them . "" But where could _you_ hear it ?"" cried Miss Bates ."
austen#""" Where could you possibly hear it , Mr . Knightley ? For it is not five minutes since I received Mrs . Cole ' s note -- no , it cannot be more than five -- or at least ten -- for I had got my bonnet and spencer on , just ready to come out -- I was only gone down to speak to Patty again about the pork -- Jane was standing in the passage -- were not you , Jane ?-- for my mother was so afraid that we had not any salting - pan large enough . So I said I would go down and see , and Jane said , ` Shall I go down instead ? for I think you have a little cold , and Patty has been washing the kitchen .'--` Oh ! my dear ,' said I -- well , and just then came the note . A Miss Hawkins -- that ' s all I know ."
austen#"A Miss Hawkins of Bath . But , Mr . Knightley , how could you possibly have heard it ? for the very moment Mr . Cole told Mrs . Cole of it , she sat down and wrote to me . A Miss Hawkins --"" "" I was with Mr . Cole on business an hour and a half ago . He had just read Elton ' s letter as I was shewn in , and handed it to me directly ."""
austen#""" Well ! that is quite -- I suppose there never was a piece of news more generally interesting . My dear sir , you really are too bountiful . My mother desires her very best compliments and regards , and a thousand thanks , and says you really quite oppress her ."" "" We consider our Hartfield pork ,"" replied Mr . Woodhouse --"" indeed it certainly is , so very superior to all other pork , that Emma and I cannot have a greater pleasure than --"" "" Oh !"
austen#"my dear sir , as my mother says , our friends are only too good to us . If ever there were people who , without having great wealth themselves , had every thing they could wish for , I am sure it is us . We may well say that ` our lot is cast in a goodly heritage .' Well , Mr . Knightley , and so you actually saw the letter ; well --"" "" It was short -- merely to announce -- but cheerful , exulting , of course ."" -- Here was a sly glance at Emma ."
austen#""" He had been so fortunate as to -- I forget the precise words -- one has no business to remember them . The information was , as you state , that he was going to be married to a Miss Hawkins . By his style , I should imagine it just settled ."" "" Mr . Elton going to be married !"" said Emma , as soon as she could speak . "" He will have every body ' s wishes for his happiness ."""
austen#""" He is very young to settle ,"" was Mr . Woodhouse ' s observation . "" He had better not be in a hurry . He seemed to me very well off as he was . We were always glad to see him at Hartfield ."" "" A new neighbour for us all , Miss Woodhouse !"" said Miss Bates , joyfully ; "" my mother is so pleased !-- she says she cannot bear to have the poor old Vicarage without a mistress ."
austen#"This is great news , indeed . Jane , you have never seen Mr . Elton !-- no wonder that you have such a curiosity to see him ."" Jane ' s curiosity did not appear of that absorbing nature as wholly to occupy her . "" No -- I have never seen Mr . Elton ,"" she replied , starting on this appeal ; "" is he -- is he a tall man ?"" "" Who shall answer that question ?"""
austen#"cried Emma . "" My father would say ` yes ,' Mr . Knightley ` no ;' and Miss Bates and I that he is just the happy medium . When you have been here a little longer , Miss Fairfax , you will understand that Mr . Elton is the standard of perfection in Highbury , both in person and mind ."" "" Very true , Miss Woodhouse , so she will . He is the very best young man -- But , my dear Jane , if you remember , I told you yesterday he was precisely the height of Mr . Perry . Miss Hawkins ,-- I dare say , an excellent young woman ."
austen#His extreme attention to my mother -- wanting her to sit in the vicarage pew , that she might hear the better , for my mother is a little deaf , you know -- it is not much , but she does not hear quite quick . Jane says that Colonel Campbell is a little deaf . He fancied bathing might be good for it -- the warm bath -- but she says it did him no lasting benefit . Colonel Campbell , you know , is quite our angel . And Mr . Dixon seems a very charming young man , quite worthy of him . It is such a happiness when good people get together -- and they always do .
austen#"Now , here will be Mr . Elton and Miss Hawkins ; and there are the Coles , such very good people ; and the Perrys -- I suppose there never was a happier or a better couple than Mr . and Mrs . Perry . I say , sir ,"" turning to Mr . Woodhouse , "" I think there are few places with such society as Highbury . I always say , we are quite blessed in our neighbours .-- My dear sir , if there is one thing my mother loves better than another , it is pork -- a roast loin of pork --"" "" As to who , or what Miss Hawkins is , or how long he has been acquainted with her ,"" said Emma , "" nothing I suppose can be known . One feels that it cannot be a very long acquaintance . He has been gone only four weeks ."""
austen#"Nobody had any information to give ; and , after a few more wonderings , Emma said , "" You are silent , Miss Fairfax -- but I hope you mean to take an interest in this news . You , who have been hearing and seeing so much of late on these subjects , who must have been so deep in the business on Miss Campbell ' s account -- we shall not excuse your being indifferent about Mr . Elton and Miss Hawkins ."" "" When I have seen Mr . Elton ,"" replied Jane , "" I dare say I shall be interested -- but I believe it requires _that_ with me . And as it is some months since Miss Campbell married , the impression may be a little worn off ."" "" Yes , he has been gone just four weeks , as you observe , Miss Woodhouse ,"" said Miss Bates , "" four weeks yesterday .-- A Miss Hawkins !-- Well , I had always rather fancied it would be some young lady hereabouts ; not that I ever -- Mrs . Cole once whispered to me -- but I immediately said , ` No , Mr . Elton is a most worthy young man -- but '-- In short , I do not think I am particularly quick at those sort of discoveries ."
austen#I do not pretend to it . What is before me , I see . At the same time , nobody could wonder if Mr . Elton should have aspired -- Miss Woodhouse lets me chatter on , so good - humouredly . She knows I would not offend for the world . How does Miss Smith do ? She seems quite recovered now .
austen#"Have you heard from Mrs . John Knightley lately ? Oh ! those dear little children . Jane , do you know I always fancy Mr . Dixon like Mr . John Knightley . I mean in person -- tall , and with that sort of look -- and not very talkative ."" "" Quite wrong , my dear aunt ; there is no likeness at all ."""
austen#""" Very odd ! but one never does form a just idea of any body beforehand . One takes up a notion , and runs away with it . Mr . Dixon , you say , is not , strictly speaking , handsome ?"" "" Handsome ! Oh !"
austen#"no -- far from it -- certainly plain . I told you he was plain ."" "" My dear , you said that Miss Campbell would not allow him to be plain , and that you yourself --"" "" Oh ! as for me , my judgment is worth nothing . Where I have a regard , I always think a person well - looking ."
austen#"But I gave what I believed the general opinion , when I called him plain ."" "" Well , my dear Jane , I believe we must be running away . The weather does not look well , and grandmama will be uneasy . You are too obliging , my dear Miss Woodhouse ; but we really must take leave . This has been a most agreeable piece of news indeed . I shall just go round by Mrs . Cole ' s ; but I shall not stop three minutes : and , Jane , you had better go home directly -- I would not have you out in a shower !-- We think she is the better for Highbury already ."
austen#Thank you , we do indeed . I shall not attempt calling on Mrs . Goddard , for I really do not think she cares for any thing but _boiled_ pork : when we dress the leg it will be another thing . Good morning to you , my dear sir . Oh ! Mr . Knightley is coming too . Well , that is so very !-- I am sure if Jane is tired , you will be so kind as to give her your arm .-- Mr .
austen#"Elton , and Miss Hawkins !-- Good morning to you ."" Emma , alone with her father , had half her attention wanted by him while he lamented that young people would be in such a hurry to marry -- and to marry strangers too -- and the other half she could give to her own view of the subject . It was to herself an amusing and a very welcome piece of news , as proving that Mr . Elton could not have suffered long ; but she was sorry for Harriet : Harriet must feel it -- and all that she could hope was , by giving the first information herself , to save her from hearing it abruptly from others . It was now about the time that she was likely to call . If she were to meet Miss Bates in her way !-- and upon its beginning to rain , Emma was obliged to expect that the weather would be detaining her at Mrs . Goddard ' s , and that the intelligence would undoubtedly rush upon her without preparation . The shower was heavy , but short ; and it had not been over five minutes , when in came Harriet , with just the heated , agitated look which hurrying thither with a full heart was likely to give ; and the "" Oh !"
austen#"Miss Woodhouse , what do you think has happened !"" which instantly burst forth , had all the evidence of corresponding perturbation . As the blow was given , Emma felt that she could not now shew greater kindness than in listening ; and Harriet , unchecked , ran eagerly through what she had to tell . "" She had set out from Mrs . Goddard ' s half an hour ago -- she had been afraid it would rain -- she had been afraid it would pour down every moment -- but she thought she might get to Hartfield first -- she had hurried on as fast as possible ; but then , as she was passing by the house where a young woman was making up a gown for her , she thought she would just step in and see how it went on ; and though she did not seem to stay half a moment there , soon after she came out it began to rain , and she did not know what to do ; so she ran on directly , as fast as she could , and took shelter at Ford ' s ."" -- Ford ' s was the principal woollen - draper , linen - draper , and haberdasher ' s shop united ; the shop first in size and fashion in the place .--"" And so , there she had set , without an idea of any thing in the world , full ten minutes , perhaps -- when , all of a sudden , who should come in -- to be sure it was so very odd !-- but they always dealt at Ford ' s -- who should come in , but Elizabeth Martin and her brother !-- Dear Miss Woodhouse ! only think ."
austen#I thought I should have fainted . I did not know what to do . I was sitting near the door -- Elizabeth saw me directly ; but he did not ; he was busy with the umbrella . I am sure she saw me , but she looked away directly , and took no notice ; and they both went to quite the farther end of the shop ; and I kept sitting near the door !-- Oh ! dear ; I was so miserable ! I am sure I must have been as white as my gown .
austen#I could not go away you know , because of the rain ; but I did so wish myself anywhere in the world but there .-- Oh ! dear , Miss Woodhouse -- well , at last , I fancy , he looked round and saw me ; for instead of going on with her buyings , they began whispering to one another . I am sure they were talking of me ; and I could not help thinking that he was persuading her to speak to me --( do you think he was , Miss Woodhouse ?) -- for presently she came forward -- came quite up to me , and asked me how I did , and seemed ready to shake hands , if I would . She did not do any of it in the same way that she used ; I could see she was altered ; but , however , she seemed to _try_ to be very friendly , and we shook hands , and stood talking some time ; but I know no more what I said -- I was in such a tremble !-- I remember she said she was sorry we never met now ; which I thought almost too kind ! Dear , Miss Woodhouse , I was absolutely miserable !
austen#By that time , it was beginning to hold up , and I was determined that nothing should stop me from getting away -- and then -- only think !-- I found he was coming up towards me too -- slowly you know , and as if he did not quite know what to do ; and so he came and spoke , and I answered -- and I stood for a minute , feeling dreadfully , you know , one can ' t tell how ; and then I took courage , and said it did not rain , and I must go ; and so off I set ; and I had not got three yards from the door , when he came after me , only to say , if I was going to Hartfield , he thought I had much better go round by Mr . Cole ' s stables , for I should find the near way quite floated by this rain . Oh ! dear , I thought it would have been the death of me ! So I said , I was very much obliged to him : you know I could not do less ; and then he went back to Elizabeth , and I came round by the stables -- I believe I did -- but I hardly knew where I was , or any thing about it . Oh ! Miss Woodhouse , I would rather done any thing than have it happen : and yet , you know , there was a sort of satisfaction in seeing him behave so pleasantly and so kindly .
austen#"And Elizabeth , too . Oh ! Miss Woodhouse , do talk to me and make me comfortable again ."" Very sincerely did Emma wish to do so ; but it was not immediately in her power . She was obliged to stop and think . She was not thoroughly comfortable herself ."
austen#The young man ' s conduct , and his sister ' s , seemed the result of real feeling , and she could not but pity them . As Harriet described it , there had been an interesting mixture of wounded affection and genuine delicacy in their behaviour . But she had believed them to be well - meaning , worthy people before ; and what difference did this make in the evils of the connexion ? It was folly to be disturbed by it . Of course , he must be sorry to lose her -- they must be all sorry . Ambition , as well as love , had probably been mortified .
austen#"They might all have hoped to rise by Harriet ' s acquaintance : and besides , what was the value of Harriet ' s description ?-- So easily pleased -- so little discerning ;-- what signified her praise ? She exerted herself , and did try to make her comfortable , by considering all that had passed as a mere trifle , and quite unworthy of being dwelt on , "" It might be distressing , for the moment ,"" said she ; "" but you seem to have behaved extremely well ; and it is over -- and may never -- can never , as a first meeting , occur again , and therefore you need not think about it ."" Harriet said , "" very true ,"" and she "" would not think about it ;"" but still she talked of it -- still she could talk of nothing else ; and Emma , at last , in order to put the Martins out of her head , was obliged to hurry on the news , which she had meant to give with so much tender caution ; hardly knowing herself whether to rejoice or be angry , ashamed or only amused , at such a state of mind in poor Harriet -- such a conclusion of Mr . Elton ' s importance with her ! Mr . Elton ' s rights , however , gradually revived . Though she did not feel the first intelligence as she might have done the day before , or an hour before , its interest soon increased ; and before their first conversation was over , she had talked herself into all the sensations of curiosity , wonder and regret , pain and pleasure , as to this fortunate Miss Hawkins , which could conduce to place the Martins under proper subordination in her fancy ."
austen#Emma learned to be rather glad that there had been such a meeting . It had been serviceable in deadening the first shock , without retaining any influence to alarm . As Harriet now lived , the Martins could not get at her , without seeking her , where hitherto they had wanted either the courage or the condescension to seek her ; for since her refusal of the brother , the sisters never had been at Mrs . Goddard ' s ; and a twelvemonth might pass without their being thrown together again , with any necessity , or even any power of speech . CHAPTER IV Human nature is so well disposed towards those who are in interesting situations , that a young person , who either marries or dies , is sure of being kindly spoken of . A week had not passed since Miss Hawkins ' s name was first mentioned in Highbury , before she was , by some means or other , discovered to have every recommendation of person and mind ; to be handsome , elegant , highly accomplished , and perfectly amiable : and when Mr . Elton himself arrived to triumph in his happy prospects , and circulate the fame of her merits , there was very little more for him to do , than to tell her Christian name , and say whose music she principally played .
austen#Mr . Elton returned , a very happy man . He had gone away rejected and mortified -- disappointed in a very sanguine hope , after a series of what appeared to him strong encouragement ; and not only losing the right lady , but finding himself debased to the level of a very wrong one . He had gone away deeply offended -- he came back engaged to another -- and to another as superior , of course , to the first , as under such circumstances what is gained always is to what is lost . He came back gay and self - satisfied , eager and busy , caring nothing for Miss Woodhouse , and defying Miss Smith . The charming Augusta Hawkins , in addition to all the usual advantages of perfect beauty and merit , was in possession of an independent fortune , of so many thousands as would always be called ten ; a point of some dignity , as well as some convenience : the story told well ; he had not thrown himself away -- he had gained a woman of 10 , 000 l . or thereabouts ; and he had gained her with such delightful rapidity -- the first hour of introduction had been so very soon followed by distinguishing notice ; the history which he had to give Mrs . Cole of the rise and progress of the affair was so glorious -- the steps so quick , from the accidental rencontre , to the dinner at Mr . Green ' s , and the party at Mrs . Brown ' s -- smiles and blushes rising in importance -- with consciousness and agitation richly scattered -- the lady had been so easily impressed -- so sweetly disposed -- had in short , to use a most intelligible phrase , been so very ready to have him , that vanity and prudence were equally contented . He had caught both substance and shadow -- both fortune and affection , and was just the happy man he ought to be ; talking only of himself and his own concerns -- expecting to be congratulated -- ready to be laughed at -- and , with cordial , fearless smiles , now addressing all the young ladies of the place , to whom , a few weeks ago , he would have been more cautiously gallant .
austen#The wedding was no distant event , as the parties had only themselves to please , and nothing but the necessary preparations to wait for ; and when he set out for Bath again , there was a general expectation , which a certain glance of Mrs . Cole ' s did not seem to contradict , that when he next entered Highbury he would bring his bride . During his present short stay , Emma had barely seen him ; but just enough to feel that the first meeting was over , and to give her the impression of his not being improved by the mixture of pique and pretension , now spread over his air . She was , in fact , beginning very much to wonder that she had ever thought him pleasing at all ; and his sight was so inseparably connected with some very disagreeable feelings , that , except in a moral light , as a penance , a lesson , a source of profitable humiliation to her own mind , she would have been thankful to be assured of never seeing him again . She wished him very well ; but he gave her pain , and his welfare twenty miles off would administer most satisfaction . The pain of his continued residence in Highbury , however , must certainly be lessened by his marriage . Many vain solicitudes would be prevented -- many awkwardnesses smoothed by it .
austen#A _Mrs . _ _Elton_ would be an excuse for any change of intercourse ; former intimacy might sink without remark . It would be almost beginning their life of civility again . Of the lady , individually , Emma thought very little . She was good enough for Mr . Elton , no doubt ; accomplished enough for Highbury -- handsome enough -- to look plain , probably , by Harriet ' s side . As to connexion , there Emma was perfectly easy ; persuaded , that after all his own vaunted claims and disdain of Harriet , he had done nothing . On that article , truth seemed attainable .
austen#_What_ she was , must be uncertain ; but _who_ she was , might be found out ; and setting aside the 10 , 000 l ., it did not appear that she was at all Harriet ' s superior . She brought no name , no blood , no alliance . Miss Hawkins was the youngest of the two daughters of a Bristol -- merchant , of course , he must be called ; but , as the whole of the profits of his mercantile life appeared so very moderate , it was not unfair to guess the dignity of his line of trade had been very moderate also . Part of every winter she had been used to spend in Bath ; but Bristol was her home , the very heart of Bristol ; for though the father and mother had died some years ago , an uncle remained -- in the law line -- nothing more distinctly honourable was hazarded of him , than that he was in the law line ; and with him the daughter had lived . Emma guessed him to be the drudge of some attorney , and too stupid to rise . And all the grandeur of the connexion seemed dependent on the elder sister , who was _very_ _well_ _married_ , to a gentleman in a _great_ _way_ , near Bristol , who kept two carriages !
austen#That was the wind - up of the history ; that was the glory of Miss Hawkins . Could she but have given Harriet her feelings about it all ! She had talked her into love ; but , alas ! she was not so easily to be talked out of it . The charm of an object to occupy the many vacancies of Harriet ' s mind was not to be talked away . He might be superseded by another ; he certainly would indeed ; nothing could be clearer ; even a Robert Martin would have been sufficient ; but nothing else , she feared , would cure her .
austen#Harriet was one of those , who , having once begun , would be always in love . And now , poor girl ! she was considerably worse from this reappearance of Mr . Elton . She was always having a glimpse of him somewhere or other . Emma saw him only once ; but two or three times every day Harriet was sure _just_ to meet with him , or _just_ to miss him , _just_ to hear his voice , or see his shoulder , _just_ to have something occur to preserve him in her fancy , in all the favouring warmth of surprize and conjecture . She was , moreover , perpetually hearing about him ; for , excepting when at Hartfield , she was always among those who saw no fault in Mr . Elton , and found nothing so interesting as the discussion of his concerns ; and every report , therefore , every guess -- all that had already occurred , all that might occur in the arrangement of his affairs , comprehending income , servants , and furniture , was continually in agitation around her .
austen#Her regard was receiving strength by invariable praise of him , and her regrets kept alive , and feelings irritated by ceaseless repetitions of Miss Hawkins ' s happiness , and continual observation of , how much he seemed attached !-- his air as he walked by the house -- the very sitting of his hat , being all in proof of how much he was in love ! Had it been allowable entertainment , had there been no pain to her friend , or reproach to herself , in the waverings of Harriet ' s mind , Emma would have been amused by its variations . Sometimes Mr . Elton predominated , sometimes the Martins ; and each was occasionally useful as a check to the other . Mr . Elton ' s engagement had been the cure of the agitation of meeting Mr . Martin . The unhappiness produced by the knowledge of that engagement had been a little put aside by Elizabeth Martin ' s calling at Mrs . Goddard ' s a few days afterwards . Harriet had not been at home ; but a note had been prepared and left for her , written in the very style to touch ; a small mixture of reproach , with a great deal of kindness ; and till Mr . Elton himself appeared , she had been much occupied by it , continually pondering over what could be done in return , and wishing to do more than she dared to confess .
austen#But Mr . Elton , in person , had driven away all such cares . While he staid , the Martins were forgotten ; and on the very morning of his setting off for Bath again , Emma , to dissipate some of the distress it occasioned , judged it best for her to return Elizabeth Martin ' s visit . How that visit was to be acknowledged -- what would be necessary -- and what might be safest , had been a point of some doubtful consideration . Absolute neglect of the mother and sisters , when invited to come , would be ingratitude . It must not be : and yet the danger of a renewal of the acquaintance !-- After much thinking , she could determine on nothing better , than Harriet ' s returning the visit ; but in a way that , if they had understanding , should convince them that it was to be only a formal acquaintance .
austen#She meant to take her in the carriage , leave her at the Abbey Mill , while she drove a little farther , and call for her again so soon , as to allow no time for insidious applications or dangerous recurrences to the past , and give the most decided proof of what degree of intimacy was chosen for the future . She could think of nothing better : and though there was something in it which her own heart could not approve -- something of ingratitude , merely glossed over -- it must be done , or what would become of Harriet ? CHAPTER V Small heart had Harriet for visiting . Only half an hour before her friend called for her at Mrs . Goddard ' s , her evil stars had led her to the very spot where , at that moment , a trunk , directed to _The_ _Rev . _ _Philip_ _Elton_ , _White - Hart_ , _Bath_ , was to be seen under the operation of being lifted into the butcher ' s cart , which was to convey it to where the coaches past ; and every thing in this world , excepting that trunk and the direction , was consequently a blank . She went , however ; and when they reached the farm , and she was to be put down , at the end of the broad , neat gravel walk , which led between espalier apple - trees to the front door , the sight of every thing which had given her so much pleasure the autumn before , was beginning to revive a little local agitation ; and when they parted , Emma observed her to be looking around with a sort of fearful curiosity , which determined her not to allow the visit to exceed the proposed quarter of an hour .
austen#She went on herself , to give that portion of time to an old servant who was married , and settled in Donwell . The quarter of an hour brought her punctually to the white gate again ; and Miss Smith receiving her summons , was with her without delay , and unattended by any alarming young man . She came solitarily down the gravel walk -- a Miss Martin just appearing at the door , and parting with her seemingly with ceremonious civility . Harriet could not very soon give an intelligible account . She was feeling too much ; but at last Emma collected from her enough to understand the sort of meeting , and the sort of pain it was creating . She had seen only Mrs . Martin and the two girls .
austen#They had received her doubtingly , if not coolly ; and nothing beyond the merest commonplace had been talked almost all the time -- till just at last , when Mrs . Martin ' s saying , all of a sudden , that she thought Miss Smith was grown , had brought on a more interesting subject , and a warmer manner . In that very room she had been measured last September , with her two friends . There were the pencilled marks and memorandums on the wainscot by the window . _He_ had done it . They all seemed to remember the day , the hour , the party , the occasion -- to feel the same consciousness , the same regrets -- to be ready to return to the same good understanding ; and they were just growing again like themselves , ( Harriet , as Emma must suspect , as ready as the best of them to be cordial and happy ,) when the carriage reappeared , and all was over . The style of the visit , and the shortness of it , were then felt to be decisive .
austen#Fourteen minutes to be given to those with whom she had thankfully passed six weeks not six months ago !-- Emma could not but picture it all , and feel how justly they might resent , how naturally Harriet must suffer . It was a bad business . She would have given a great deal , or endured a great deal , to have had the Martins in a higher rank of life . They were so deserving , that a _little_ higher should have been enough : but as it was , how could she have done otherwise ?-- Impossible !-- She could not repent . They must be separated ; but there was a great deal of pain in the process -- so much to herself at this time , that she soon felt the necessity of a little consolation , and resolved on going home by way of Randalls to procure it . Her mind was quite sick of Mr . Elton and the Martins .
austen#"The refreshment of Randalls was absolutely necessary . It was a good scheme ; but on driving to the door they heard that neither "" master nor mistress was at home ;"" they had both been out some time ; the man believed they were gone to Hartfield . "" This is too bad ,"" cried Emma , as they turned away . "" And now we shall just miss them ; too provoking !-- I do not know when I have been so disappointed ."" And she leaned back in the corner , to indulge her murmurs , or to reason them away ; probably a little of both -- such being the commonest process of a not ill - disposed mind . Presently the carriage stopt ; she looked up ; it was stopt by Mr . and Mrs . Weston , who were standing to speak to her ."
austen#"There was instant pleasure in the sight of them , and still greater pleasure was conveyed in sound -- for Mr . Weston immediately accosted her with , "" How d ' ye do ?-- how d ' ye do ?-- We have been sitting with your father -- glad to see him so well . Frank comes to - morrow -- I had a letter this morning -- we see him to - morrow by dinner - time to a certainty -- he is at Oxford to - day , and he comes for a whole fortnight ; I knew it would be so . If he had come at Christmas he could not have staid three days ; I was always glad he did not come at Christmas ; now we are going to have just the right weather for him , fine , dry , settled weather . We shall enjoy him completely ; every thing has turned out exactly as we could wish ."" There was no resisting such news , no possibility of avoiding the influence of such a happy face as Mr . Weston ' s , confirmed as it all was by the words and the countenance of his wife , fewer and quieter , but not less to the purpose ."
austen#"To know that _she_ thought his coming certain was enough to make Emma consider it so , and sincerely did she rejoice in their joy . It was a most delightful reanimation of exhausted spirits . The worn - out past was sunk in the freshness of what was coming ; and in the rapidity of half a moment ' s thought , she hoped Mr . Elton would now be talked of no more . Mr . Weston gave her the history of the engagements at Enscombe , which allowed his son to answer for having an entire fortnight at his command , as well as the route and the method of his journey ; and she listened , and smiled , and congratulated . "" I shall soon bring him over to Hartfield ,"" said he , at the conclusion . Emma could imagine she saw a touch of the arm at this speech , from his wife ."
austen#""" We had better move on , Mr . Weston ,"" said she , "" we are detaining the girls ."" "" Well , well , I am ready ;""-- and turning again to Emma , "" but you must not be expecting such a _very_ fine young man ; you have only had _my_ account you know ; I dare say he is really nothing extraordinary :""-- though his own sparkling eyes at the moment were speaking a very different conviction . Emma could look perfectly unconscious and innocent , and answer in a manner that appropriated nothing . "" Think of me to - morrow , my dear Emma , about four o ' clock ,"" was Mrs . Weston ' s parting injunction ; spoken with some anxiety , and meant only for her . "" Four o ' clock !-- depend upon it he will be here by three ,"" was Mr . Weston ' s quick amendment ; and so ended a most satisfactory meeting . Emma ' s spirits were mounted quite up to happiness ; every thing wore a different air ; James and his horses seemed not half so sluggish as before ."
austen#"When she looked at the hedges , she thought the elder at least must soon be coming out ; and when she turned round to Harriet , she saw something like a look of spring , a tender smile even there . "" Will Mr . Frank Churchill pass through Bath as well as Oxford ?"" -- was a question , however , which did not augur much . But neither geography nor tranquillity could come all at once , and Emma was now in a humour to resolve that they should both come in time . The morning of the interesting day arrived , and Mrs . Weston ' s faithful pupil did not forget either at ten , or eleven , or twelve o ' clock , that she was to think of her at four . "" My dear , dear anxious friend ,""-- said she , in mental soliloquy , while walking downstairs from her own room , "" always overcareful for every body ' s comfort but your own ; I see you now in all your little fidgets , going again and again into his room , to be sure that all is right ."""
austen#"The clock struck twelve as she passed through the hall . ""' Tis twelve ; I shall not forget to think of you four hours hence ; and by this time to - morrow , perhaps , or a little later , I may be thinking of the possibility of their all calling here . I am sure they will bring him soon ."" She opened the parlour door , and saw two gentlemen sitting with her father -- Mr . Weston and his son . They had been arrived only a few minutes , and Mr . Weston had scarcely finished his explanation of Frank ' s being a day before his time , and her father was yet in the midst of his very civil welcome and congratulations , when she appeared , to have her share of surprize , introduction , and pleasure . The Frank Churchill so long talked of , so high in interest , was actually before her -- he was presented to her , and she did not think too much had been said in his praise ; he was a _very_ good looking young man ; height , air , address , all were unexceptionable , and his countenance had a great deal of the spirit and liveliness of his father ' s ; he looked quick and sensible ."
austen#"She felt immediately that she should like him ; and there was a well - bred ease of manner , and a readiness to talk , which convinced her that he came intending to be acquainted with her , and that acquainted they soon must be . He had reached Randalls the evening before . She was pleased with the eagerness to arrive which had made him alter his plan , and travel earlier , later , and quicker , that he might gain half a day . "" I told you yesterday ,"" cried Mr . Weston with exultation , "" I told you all that he would be here before the time named . I remembered what I used to do myself . One cannot creep upon a journey ; one cannot help getting on faster than one has planned ; and the pleasure of coming in upon one ' s friends before the look - out begins , is worth a great deal more than any little exertion it needs ."""
austen#""" It is a great pleasure where one can indulge in it ,"" said the young man , "" though there are not many houses that I should presume on so far ; but in coming _home_ I felt I might do any thing ."" The word _home_ made his father look on him with fresh complacency . Emma was directly sure that he knew how to make himself agreeable ; the conviction was strengthened by what followed . He was very much pleased with Randalls , thought it a most admirably arranged house , would hardly allow it even to be very small , admired the situation , the walk to Highbury , Highbury itself , Hartfield still more , and professed himself to have always felt the sort of interest in the country which none but one ' s _own_ country gives , and the greatest curiosity to visit it . That he should never have been able to indulge so amiable a feeling before , passed suspiciously through Emma ' s brain ; but still , if it were a falsehood , it was a pleasant one , and pleasantly handled . His manner had no air of study or exaggeration ."
austen#"He did really look and speak as if in a state of no common enjoyment . Their subjects in general were such as belong to an opening acquaintance . On his side were the inquiries ,--"" Was she a horsewoman ?-- Pleasant rides ?-- Pleasant walks ?-- Had they a large neighbourhood ?-- Highbury , perhaps , afforded society enough ?-- There were several very pretty houses in and about it .-- Balls -- had they balls ?-- Was it a musical society ?"" But when satisfied on all these points , and their acquaintance proportionably advanced , he contrived to find an opportunity , while their two fathers were engaged with each other , of introducing his mother - in - law , and speaking of her with so much handsome praise , so much warm admiration , so much gratitude for the happiness she secured to his father , and her very kind reception of himself , as was an additional proof of his knowing how to please -- and of his certainly thinking it worth while to try to please her . He did not advance a word of praise beyond what she knew to be thoroughly deserved by Mrs . Weston ; but , undoubtedly he could know very little of the matter . He understood what would be welcome ; he could be sure of little else ."
austen#""" His father ' s marriage ,"" he said , "" had been the wisest measure , every friend must rejoice in it ; and the family from whom he had received such a blessing must be ever considered as having conferred the highest obligation on him ."" He got as near as he could to thanking her for Miss Taylor ' s merits , without seeming quite to forget that in the common course of things it was to be rather supposed that Miss Taylor had formed Miss Woodhouse ' s character , than Miss Woodhouse Miss Taylor ' s . And at last , as if resolved to qualify his opinion completely for travelling round to its object , he wound it all up with astonishment at the youth and beauty of her person . "" Elegant , agreeable manners , I was prepared for ,"" said he ; "" but I confess that , considering every thing , I had not expected more than a very tolerably well - looking woman of a certain age ; I did not know that I was to find a pretty young woman in Mrs . Weston ."" "" You cannot see too much perfection in Mrs . Weston for my feelings ,"" said Emma ; "" were you to guess her to be _eighteen_ , I should listen with pleasure ; but _she_ would be ready to quarrel with you for using such words ."
austen#"Don ' t let her imagine that you have spoken of her as a pretty young woman ."" "" I hope I should know better ,"" he replied ; "" no , depend upon it , ( with a gallant bow ,) that in addressing Mrs . Weston I should understand whom I might praise without any danger of being thought extravagant in my terms ."" Emma wondered whether the same suspicion of what might be expected from their knowing each other , which had taken strong possession of her mind , had ever crossed his ; and whether his compliments were to be considered as marks of acquiescence , or proofs of defiance . She must see more of him to understand his ways ; at present she only felt they were agreeable . She had no doubt of what Mr . Weston was often thinking about . His quick eye she detected again and again glancing towards them with a happy expression ; and even , when he might have determined not to look , she was confident that he was often listening ."
austen#"Her own father ' s perfect exemption from any thought of the kind , the entire deficiency in him of all such sort of penetration or suspicion , was a most comfortable circumstance . Happily he was not farther from approving matrimony than from foreseeing it .-- Though always objecting to every marriage that was arranged , he never suffered beforehand from the apprehension of any ; it seemed as if he could not think so ill of any two persons ' understanding as to suppose they meant to marry till it were proved against them . She blessed the favouring blindness . He could now , without the drawback of a single unpleasant surmise , without a glance forward at any possible treachery in his guest , give way to all his natural kind - hearted civility in solicitous inquiries after Mr . Frank Churchill ' s accommodation on his journey , through the sad evils of sleeping two nights on the road , and express very genuine unmixed anxiety to know that he had certainly escaped catching cold -- which , however , he could not allow him to feel quite assured of himself till after another night . A reasonable visit paid , Mr . Weston began to move .--"" He must be going . He had business at the Crown about his hay , and a great many errands for Mrs . Weston at Ford ' s , but he need not hurry any body else ."""
austen#"His son , too well bred to hear the hint , rose immediately also , saying , "" As you are going farther on business , sir , I will take the opportunity of paying a visit , which must be paid some day or other , and therefore may as well be paid now . I have the honour of being acquainted with a neighbour of yours , ( turning to Emma ,) a lady residing in or near Highbury ; a family of the name of Fairfax . I shall have no difficulty , I suppose , in finding the house ; though Fairfax , I believe , is not the proper name -- I should rather say Barnes , or Bates . Do you know any family of that name ?"" "" To be sure we do ,"" cried his father ; "" Mrs . Bates -- we passed her house -- I saw Miss Bates at the window ."
austen#"True , true , you are acquainted with Miss Fairfax ; I remember you knew her at Weymouth , and a fine girl she is . Call upon her , by all means ."" "" There is no necessity for my calling this morning ,"" said the young man ; "" another day would do as well ; but there was that degree of acquaintance at Weymouth which --"" "" Oh ! go to - day , go to - day . Do not defer it ."
austen#"What is right to be done cannot be done too soon . And , besides , I must give you a hint , Frank ; any want of attention to her _here_ should be carefully avoided . You saw her with the Campbells , when she was the equal of every body she mixed with , but here she is with a poor old grandmother , who has barely enough to live on . If you do not call early it will be a slight ."" The son looked convinced . "" I have heard her speak of the acquaintance ,"" said Emma ; "" she is a very elegant young woman ."""
austen#"He agreed to it , but with so quiet a "" Yes ,"" as inclined her almost to doubt his real concurrence ; and yet there must be a very distinct sort of elegance for the fashionable world , if Jane Fairfax could be thought only ordinarily gifted with it . "" If you were never particularly struck by her manners before ,"" said she , "" I think you will to - day . You will see her to advantage ; see her and hear her -- no , I am afraid you will not hear her at all , for she has an aunt who never holds her tongue ."" "" You are acquainted with Miss Jane Fairfax , sir , are you ?"" said Mr . Woodhouse , always the last to make his way in conversation ; "" then give me leave to assure you that you will find her a very agreeable young lady . She is staying here on a visit to her grandmama and aunt , very worthy people ; I have known them all my life ."
austen#"They will be extremely glad to see you , I am sure ; and one of my servants shall go with you to shew you the way ."" "" My dear sir , upon no account in the world ; my father can direct me ."" "" But your father is not going so far ; he is only going to the Crown , quite on the other side of the street , and there are a great many houses ; you might be very much at a loss , and it is a very dirty walk , unless you keep on the footpath ; but my coachman can tell you where you had best cross the street ."" Mr . Frank Churchill still declined it , looking as serious as he could , and his father gave his hearty support by calling out , "" My good friend , this is quite unnecessary ; Frank knows a puddle of water when he sees it , and as to Mrs . Bates ' s , he may get there from the Crown in a hop , step , and jump ."" They were permitted to go alone ; and with a cordial nod from one , and a graceful bow from the other , the two gentlemen took leave . Emma remained very well pleased with this beginning of the acquaintance , and could now engage to think of them all at Randalls any hour of the day , with full confidence in their comfort ."
austen#"CHAPTER VI The next morning brought Mr . Frank Churchill again . He came with Mrs . Weston , to whom and to Highbury he seemed to take very cordially . He had been sitting with her , it appeared , most companionably at home , till her usual hour of exercise ; and on being desired to chuse their walk , immediately fixed on Highbury .--"" He did not doubt there being very pleasant walks in every direction , but if left to him , he should always chuse the same . Highbury , that airy , cheerful , happy - looking Highbury , would be his constant attraction ."" -- Highbury , with Mrs . Weston , stood for Hartfield ; and she trusted to its bearing the same construction with him ."
austen#They walked thither directly . Emma had hardly expected them : for Mr . Weston , who had called in for half a minute , in order to hear that his son was very handsome , knew nothing of their plans ; and it was an agreeable surprize to her , therefore , to perceive them walking up to the house together , arm in arm . She was wanting to see him again , and especially to see him in company with Mrs . Weston , upon his behaviour to whom her opinion of him was to depend . If he were deficient there , nothing should make amends for it . But on seeing them together , she became perfectly satisfied . It was not merely in fine words or hyperbolical compliment that he paid his duty ; nothing could be more proper or pleasing than his whole manner to her -- nothing could more agreeably denote his wish of considering her as a friend and securing her affection .
austen#And there was time enough for Emma to form a reasonable judgment , as their visit included all the rest of the morning . They were all three walking about together for an hour or two -- first round the shrubberies of Hartfield , and afterwards in Highbury . He was delighted with every thing ; admired Hartfield sufficiently for Mr . Woodhouse ' s ear ; and when their going farther was resolved on , confessed his wish to be made acquainted with the whole village , and found matter of commendation and interest much oftener than Emma could have supposed . Some of the objects of his curiosity spoke very amiable feelings . He begged to be shewn the house which his father had lived in so long , and which had been the home of his father ' s father ; and on recollecting that an old woman who had nursed him was still living , walked in quest of her cottage from one end of the street to the other ; and though in some points of pursuit or observation there was no positive merit , they shewed , altogether , a good - will towards Highbury in general , which must be very like a merit to those he was with . Emma watched and decided , that with such feelings as were now shewn , it could not be fairly supposed that he had been ever voluntarily absenting himself ; that he had not been acting a part , or making a parade of insincere professions ; and that Mr . Knightley certainly had not done him justice .
austen#Their first pause was at the Crown Inn , an inconsiderable house , though the principal one of the sort , where a couple of pair of post - horses were kept , more for the convenience of the neighbourhood than from any run on the road ; and his companions had not expected to be detained by any interest excited there ; but in passing it they gave the history of the large room visibly added ; it had been built many years ago for a ball - room , and while the neighbourhood had been in a particularly populous , dancing state , had been occasionally used as such ;-- but such brilliant days had long passed away , and now the highest purpose for which it was ever wanted was to accommodate a whist club established among the gentlemen and half - gentlemen of the place . He was immediately interested . Its character as a ball - room caught him ; and instead of passing on , he stopt for several minutes at the two superior sashed windows which were open , to look in and contemplate its capabilities , and lament that its original purpose should have ceased . He saw no fault in the room , he would acknowledge none which they suggested . No , it was long enough , broad enough , handsome enough . It would hold the very number for comfort .
austen#They ought to have balls there at least every fortnight through the winter . Why had not Miss Woodhouse revived the former good old days of the room ?-- She who could do any thing in Highbury ! The want of proper families in the place , and the conviction that none beyond the place and its immediate environs could be tempted to attend , were mentioned ; but he was not satisfied . He could not be persuaded that so many good - looking houses as he saw around him , could not furnish numbers enough for such a meeting ; and even when particulars were given and families described , he was still unwilling to admit that the inconvenience of such a mixture would be any thing , or that there would be the smallest difficulty in every body ' s returning into their proper place the next morning . He argued like a young man very much bent on dancing ; and Emma was rather surprized to see the constitution of the Weston prevail so decidedly against the habits of the Churchills . He seemed to have all the life and spirit , cheerful feelings , and social inclinations of his father , and nothing of the pride or reserve of Enscombe .
austen#"Of pride , indeed , there was , perhaps , scarcely enough ; his indifference to a confusion of rank , bordered too much on inelegance of mind . He could be no judge , however , of the evil he was holding cheap . It was but an effusion of lively spirits . At last he was persuaded to move on from the front of the Crown ; and being now almost facing the house where the Bateses lodged , Emma recollected his intended visit the day before , and asked him if he had paid it . "" Yes , oh ! yes ""-- he replied ; "" I was just going to mention it ."
austen#"A very successful visit :-- I saw all the three ladies ; and felt very much obliged to you for your preparatory hint . If the talking aunt had taken me quite by surprize , it must have been the death of me . As it was , I was only betrayed into paying a most unreasonable visit . Ten minutes would have been all that was necessary , perhaps all that was proper ; and I had told my father I should certainly be at home before him -- but there was no getting away , no pause ; and , to my utter astonishment , I found , when he ( finding me nowhere else ) joined me there at last , that I had been actually sitting with them very nearly three - quarters of an hour . The good lady had not given me the possibility of escape before ."" "" And how did you think Miss Fairfax looking ?"""
austen#""" Ill , very ill -- that is , if a young lady can ever be allowed to look ill . But the expression is hardly admissible , Mrs . Weston , is it ? Ladies can never look ill . And , seriously , Miss Fairfax is naturally so pale , as almost always to give the appearance of ill health .-- A most deplorable want of complexion ."" Emma would not agree to this , and began a warm defence of Miss Fairfax ' s complexion . "" It was certainly never brilliant , but she would not allow it to have a sickly hue in general ; and there was a softness and delicacy in her skin which gave peculiar elegance to the character of her face ."" He listened with all due deference ; acknowledged that he had heard many people say the same -- but yet he must confess , that to him nothing could make amends for the want of the fine glow of health ."
austen#"Where features were indifferent , a fine complexion gave beauty to them all ; and where they were good , the effect was -- fortunately he need not attempt to describe what the effect was . "" Well ,"" said Emma , "" there is no disputing about taste .-- At least you admire her except her complexion ."" He shook his head and laughed .--"" I cannot separate Miss Fairfax and her complexion ."" "" Did you see her often at Weymouth ? Were you often in the same society ?"" At this moment they were approaching Ford ' s , and he hastily exclaimed , "" Ha !"
austen#"this must be the very shop that every body attends every day of their lives , as my father informs me . He comes to Highbury himself , he says , six days out of the seven , and has always business at Ford ' s . If it be not inconvenient to you , pray let us go in , that I may prove myself to belong to the place , to be a true citizen of Highbury . I must buy something at Ford ' s . It will be taking out my freedom .-- I dare say they sell gloves ."" "" Oh !"
austen#"yes , gloves and every thing . I do admire your patriotism . You will be adored in Highbury . You were very popular before you came , because you were Mr . Weston ' s son -- but lay out half a guinea at Ford ' s , and your popularity will stand upon your own virtues ."" They went in ; and while the sleek , well - tied parcels of "" Men ' s Beavers "" and "" York Tan "" were bringing down and displaying on the counter , he said --"" But I beg your pardon , Miss Woodhouse , you were speaking to me , you were saying something at the very moment of this burst of my _amor_ _patriae_ . Do not let me lose it ."
austen#"I assure you the utmost stretch of public fame would not make me amends for the loss of any happiness in private life ."" "" I merely asked , whether you had known much of Miss Fairfax and her party at Weymouth ."" "" And now that I understand your question , I must pronounce it to be a very unfair one . It is always the lady ' s right to decide on the degree of acquaintance . Miss Fairfax must already have given her account .-- I shall not commit myself by claiming more than she may chuse to allow ."" "" Upon my word !"
austen#"you answer as discreetly as she could do herself . But her account of every thing leaves so much to be guessed , she is so very reserved , so very unwilling to give the least information about any body , that I really think you may say what you like of your acquaintance with her ."" "" May I , indeed ?-- Then I will speak the truth , and nothing suits me so well . I met her frequently at Weymouth . I had known the Campbells a little in town ; and at Weymouth we were very much in the same set . Colonel Campbell is a very agreeable man , and Mrs . Campbell a friendly , warm - hearted woman ."
austen#"I like them all ."" "" You know Miss Fairfax ' s situation in life , I conclude ; what she is destined to be ?"" "" Yes --( rather hesitatingly )-- I believe I do ."" "" You get upon delicate subjects , Emma ,"" said Mrs . Weston smiling ; "" remember that I am here .-- Mr . Frank Churchill hardly knows what to say when you speak of Miss Fairfax ' s situation in life . I will move a little farther off ."""
austen#""" I certainly do forget to think of _her_ ,"" said Emma , "" as having ever been any thing but my friend and my dearest friend ."" He looked as if he fully understood and honoured such a sentiment . When the gloves were bought , and they had quitted the shop again , "" Did you ever hear the young lady we were speaking of , play ?"" said Frank Churchill . "" Ever hear her !"" repeated Emma ."
austen#""" You forget how much she belongs to Highbury . I have heard her every year of our lives since we both began . She plays charmingly ."" "" You think so , do you ?-- I wanted the opinion of some one who could really judge . She appeared to me to play well , that is , with considerable taste , but I know nothing of the matter myself .-- I am excessively fond of music , but without the smallest skill or right of judging of any body ' s performance .-- I have been used to hear her ' s admired ; and I remember one proof of her being thought to play well :-- a man , a very musical man , and in love with another woman -- engaged to her -- on the point of marriage -- would yet never ask that other woman to sit down to the instrument , if the lady in question could sit down instead -- never seemed to like to hear one if he could hear the other . That , I thought , in a man of known musical talent , was some proof ."""
austen#""" Proof indeed !"" said Emma , highly amused .--"" Mr . Dixon is very musical , is he ? We shall know more about them all , in half an hour , from you , than Miss Fairfax would have vouchsafed in half a year ."" "" Yes , Mr . Dixon and Miss Campbell were the persons ; and I thought it a very strong proof ."" "" Certainly -- very strong it was ; to own the truth , a great deal stronger than , if _I_ had been Miss Campbell , would have been at all agreeable to me ."
austen#"I could not excuse a man ' s having more music than love -- more ear than eye -- a more acute sensibility to fine sounds than to my feelings . How did Miss Campbell appear to like it ?"" "" It was her very particular friend , you know ."" "" Poor comfort !"" said Emma , laughing . "" One would rather have a stranger preferred than one ' s very particular friend -- with a stranger it might not recur again -- but the misery of having a very particular friend always at hand , to do every thing better than one does oneself !-- Poor Mrs . Dixon !"
austen#"Well , I am glad she is gone to settle in Ireland ."" "" You are right . It was not very flattering to Miss Campbell ; but she really did not seem to feel it ."" "" So much the better -- or so much the worse :-- I do not know which . But be it sweetness or be it stupidity in her -- quickness of friendship , or dulness of feeling -- there was one person , I think , who must have felt it : Miss Fairfax herself . She must have felt the improper and dangerous distinction ."""
austen#""" As to that -- I do not --"" "" Oh ! do not imagine that I expect an account of Miss Fairfax ' s sensations from you , or from any body else . They are known to no human being , I guess , but herself . But if she continued to play whenever she was asked by Mr . Dixon , one may guess what one chuses ."" "" There appeared such a perfectly good understanding among them all --"" he began rather quickly , but checking himself , added , "" however , it is impossible for me to say on what terms they really were -- how it might all be behind the scenes ."
austen#"I can only say that there was smoothness outwardly . But you , who have known Miss Fairfax from a child , must be a better judge of her character , and of how she is likely to conduct herself in critical situations , than I can be ."" "" I have known her from a child , undoubtedly ; we have been children and women together ; and it is natural to suppose that we should be intimate ,-- that we should have taken to each other whenever she visited her friends . But we never did . I hardly know how it has happened ; a little , perhaps , from that wickedness on my side which was prone to take disgust towards a girl so idolized and so cried up as she always was , by her aunt and grandmother , and all their set . And then , her reserve -- I never could attach myself to any one so completely reserved ."""
austen#""" It is a most repulsive quality , indeed ,"" said he . "" Oftentimes very convenient , no doubt , but never pleasing . There is safety in reserve , but no attraction . One cannot love a reserved person ."" "" Not till the reserve ceases towards oneself ; and then the attraction may be the greater . But I must be more in want of a friend , or an agreeable companion , than I have yet been , to take the trouble of conquering any body ' s reserve to procure one ."
austen#"Intimacy between Miss Fairfax and me is quite out of the question . I have no reason to think ill of her -- not the least -- except that such extreme and perpetual cautiousness of word and manner , such a dread of giving a distinct idea about any body , is apt to suggest suspicions of there being something to conceal ."" He perfectly agreed with her : and after walking together so long , and thinking so much alike , Emma felt herself so well acquainted with him , that she could hardly believe it to be only their second meeting . He was not exactly what she had expected ; less of the man of the world in some of his notions , less of the spoiled child of fortune , therefore better than she had expected . His ideas seemed more moderate -- his feelings warmer . She was particularly struck by his manner of considering Mr . Elton ' s house , which , as well as the church , he would go and look at , and would not join them in finding much fault with ."
austen#No , he could not believe it a bad house ; not such a house as a man was to be pitied for having . If it were to be shared with the woman he loved , he could not think any man to be pitied for having that house . There must be ample room in it for every real comfort . The man must be a blockhead who wanted more . Mrs . Weston laughed , and said he did not know what he was talking about . Used only to a large house himself , and without ever thinking how many advantages and accommodations were attached to its size , he could be no judge of the privations inevitably belonging to a small one .
austen#But Emma , in her own mind , determined that he _did_ know what he was talking about , and that he shewed a very amiable inclination to settle early in life , and to marry , from worthy motives . He might not be aware of the inroads on domestic peace to be occasioned by no housekeeper ' s room , or a bad butler ' s pantry , but no doubt he did perfectly feel that Enscombe could not make him happy , and that whenever he were attached , he would willingly give up much of wealth to be allowed an early establishment . CHAPTER VII Emma ' s very good opinion of Frank Churchill was a little shaken the following day , by hearing that he was gone off to London , merely to have his hair cut . A sudden freak seemed to have seized him at breakfast , and he had sent for a chaise and set off , intending to return to dinner , but with no more important view that appeared than having his hair cut . There was certainly no harm in his travelling sixteen miles twice over on such an errand ; but there was an air of foppery and nonsense in it which she could not approve .
austen#"It did not accord with the rationality of plan , the moderation in expense , or even the unselfish warmth of heart , which she had believed herself to discern in him yesterday . Vanity , extravagance , love of change , restlessness of temper , which must be doing something , good or bad ; heedlessness as to the pleasure of his father and Mrs . Weston , indifferent as to how his conduct might appear in general ; he became liable to all these charges . His father only called him a coxcomb , and thought it a very good story ; but that Mrs . Weston did not like it , was clear enough , by her passing it over as quickly as possible , and making no other comment than that "" all young people would have their little whims ."" With the exception of this little blot , Emma found that his visit hitherto had given her friend only good ideas of him . Mrs . Weston was very ready to say how attentive and pleasant a companion he made himself -- how much she saw to like in his disposition altogether . He appeared to have a very open temper -- certainly a very cheerful and lively one ; she could observe nothing wrong in his notions , a great deal decidedly right ; he spoke of his uncle with warm regard , was fond of talking of him -- said he would be the best man in the world if he were left to himself ; and though there was no being attached to the aunt , he acknowledged her kindness with gratitude , and seemed to mean always to speak of her with respect ."
austen#"This was all very promising ; and , but for such an unfortunate fancy for having his hair cut , there was nothing to denote him unworthy of the distinguished honour which her imagination had given him ; the honour , if not of being really in love with her , of being at least very near it , and saved only by her own indifference -- ( for still her resolution held of never marrying )-- the honour , in short , of being marked out for her by all their joint acquaintance . Mr . Weston , on his side , added a virtue to the account which must have some weight . He gave her to understand that Frank admired her extremely -- thought her very beautiful and very charming ; and with so much to be said for him altogether , she found she must not judge him harshly . As Mrs . Weston observed , "" all young people would have their little whims ."" There was one person among his new acquaintance in Surry , not so leniently disposed . In general he was judged , throughout the parishes of Donwell and Highbury , with great candour ; liberal allowances were made for the little excesses of such a handsome young man -- one who smiled so often and bowed so well ; but there was one spirit among them not to be softened , from its power of censure , by bows or smiles -- Mr . Knightley ."
austen#"The circumstance was told him at Hartfield ; for the moment , he was silent ; but Emma heard him almost immediately afterwards say to himself , over a newspaper he held in his hand , "" Hum ! just the trifling , silly fellow I took him for ."" She had half a mind to resent ; but an instant ' s observation convinced her that it was really said only to relieve his own feelings , and not meant to provoke ; and therefore she let it pass . Although in one instance the bearers of not good tidings , Mr . and Mrs . Weston ' s visit this morning was in another respect particularly opportune . Something occurred while they were at Hartfield , to make Emma want their advice ; and , which was still more lucky , she wanted exactly the advice they gave . This was the occurrence :-- The Coles had been settled some years in Highbury , and were very good sort of people -- friendly , liberal , and unpretending ; but , on the other hand , they were of low origin , in trade , and only moderately genteel ."
austen#On their first coming into the country , they had lived in proportion to their income , quietly , keeping little company , and that little unexpensively ; but the last year or two had brought them a considerable increase of means -- the house in town had yielded greater profits , and fortune in general had smiled on them . With their wealth , their views increased ; their want of a larger house , their inclination for more company . They added to their house , to their number of servants , to their expenses of every sort ; and by this time were , in fortune and style of living , second only to the family at Hartfield . Their love of society , and their new dining - room , prepared every body for their keeping dinner - company ; and a few parties , chiefly among the single men , had already taken place . The regular and best families Emma could hardly suppose they would presume to invite -- neither Donwell , nor Hartfield , nor Randalls . Nothing should tempt _her_ to go , if they did ; and she regretted that her father ' s known habits would be giving her refusal less meaning than she could wish .
austen#"The Coles were very respectable in their way , but they ought to be taught that it was not for them to arrange the terms on which the superior families would visit them . This lesson , she very much feared , they would receive only from herself ; she had little hope of Mr . Knightley , none of Mr . Weston . But she had made up her mind how to meet this presumption so many weeks before it appeared , that when the insult came at last , it found her very differently affected . Donwell and Randalls had received their invitation , and none had come for her father and herself ; and Mrs . Weston ' s accounting for it with "" I suppose they will not take the liberty with you ; they know you do not dine out ,"" was not quite sufficient . She felt that she should like to have had the power of refusal ; and afterwards , as the idea of the party to be assembled there , consisting precisely of those whose society was dearest to her , occurred again and again , she did not know that she might not have been tempted to accept . Harriet was to be there in the evening , and the Bateses ."
austen#"They had been speaking of it as they walked about Highbury the day before , and Frank Churchill had most earnestly lamented her absence . Might not the evening end in a dance ? had been a question of his . The bare possibility of it acted as a farther irritation on her spirits ; and her being left in solitary grandeur , even supposing the omission to be intended as a compliment , was but poor comfort . It was the arrival of this very invitation while the Westons were at Hartfield , which made their presence so acceptable ; for though her first remark , on reading it , was that "" of course it must be declined ,"" she so very soon proceeded to ask them what they advised her to do , that their advice for her going was most prompt and successful . She owned that , considering every thing , she was not absolutely without inclination for the party ."
austen#"The Coles expressed themselves so properly -- there was so much real attention in the manner of it -- so much consideration for her father . "" They would have solicited the honour earlier , but had been waiting the arrival of a folding - screen from London , which they hoped might keep Mr . Woodhouse from any draught of air , and therefore induce him the more readily to give them the honour of his company ."" Upon the whole , she was very persuadable ; and it being briefly settled among themselves how it might be done without neglecting his comfort -- how certainly Mrs . Goddard , if not Mrs . Bates , might be depended on for bearing him company -- Mr . Woodhouse was to be talked into an acquiescence of his daughter ' s going out to dinner on a day now near at hand , and spending the whole evening away from him . As for _his_ going , Emma did not wish him to think it possible , the hours would be too late , and the party too numerous . He was soon pretty well resigned . "" I am not fond of dinner - visiting ,"" said he --"" I never was ."
austen#"No more is Emma . Late hours do not agree with us . I am sorry Mr . and Mrs . Cole should have done it . I think it would be much better if they would come in one afternoon next summer , and take their tea with us -- take us in their afternoon walk ; which they might do , as our hours are so reasonable , and yet get home without being out in the damp of the evening . The dews of a summer evening are what I would not expose any body to . However , as they are so very desirous to have dear Emma dine with them , and as you will both be there , and Mr . Knightley too , to take care of her , I cannot wish to prevent it , provided the weather be what it ought , neither damp , nor cold , nor windy ."""
austen#"Then turning to Mrs . Weston , with a look of gentle reproach --"" Ah ! Miss Taylor , if you had not married , you would have staid at home with me ."" "" Well , sir ,"" cried Mr . Weston , "" as I took Miss Taylor away , it is incumbent on me to supply her place , if I can ; and I will step to Mrs . Goddard in a moment , if you wish it ."" But the idea of any thing to be done in a _moment_ , was increasing , not lessening , Mr . Woodhouse ' s agitation . The ladies knew better how to allay it . Mr . Weston must be quiet , and every thing deliberately arranged ."
austen#"With this treatment , Mr . Woodhouse was soon composed enough for talking as usual . "" He should be happy to see Mrs . Goddard . He had a great regard for Mrs . Goddard ; and Emma should write a line , and invite her . James could take the note . But first of all , there must be an answer written to Mrs . Cole ."""
austen#""" You will make my excuses , my dear , as civilly as possible . You will say that I am quite an invalid , and go no where , and therefore must decline their obliging invitation ; beginning with my _compliments_ , of course . But you will do every thing right . I need not tell you what is to be done . We must remember to let James know that the carriage will be wanted on Tuesday . I shall have no fears for you with him ."
austen#"We have never been there above once since the new approach was made ; but still I have no doubt that James will take you very safely . And when you get there , you must tell him at what time you would have him come for you again ; and you had better name an early hour . You will not like staying late . You will get very tired when tea is over ."" "" But you would not wish me to come away before I am tired , papa ?"" "" Oh !"
austen#"no , my love ; but you will soon be tired . There will be a great many people talking at once . You will not like the noise ."" "" But , my dear sir ,"" cried Mr . Weston , "" if Emma comes away early , it will be breaking up the party ."" "" And no great harm if it does ,"" said Mr . Woodhouse . "" The sooner every party breaks up , the better ."""
austen#""" But you do not consider how it may appear to the Coles . Emma ' s going away directly after tea might be giving offence . They are good - natured people , and think little of their own claims ; but still they must feel that any body ' s hurrying away is no great compliment ; and Miss Woodhouse ' s doing it would be more thought of than any other person ' s in the room . You would not wish to disappoint and mortify the Coles , I am sure , sir ; friendly , good sort of people as ever lived , and who have been your neighbours these _ten_ years ."" "" No , upon no account in the world , Mr . Weston ; I am much obliged to you for reminding me . I should be extremely sorry to be giving them any pain ."
austen#I know what worthy people they are . Perry tells me that Mr . Cole never touches malt liquor . You would not think it to look at him , but he is bilious -- Mr . Cole is very bilious . No , I would not be the means of giving them any pain . My dear Emma , we must consider this . I am sure , rather than run the risk of hurting Mr . and Mrs . Cole , you would stay a little longer than you might wish .
austen#"You will not regard being tired . You will be perfectly safe , you know , among your friends ."" "" Oh yes , papa . I have no fears at all for myself ; and I should have no scruples of staying as late as Mrs . Weston , but on your account . I am only afraid of your sitting up for me . I am not afraid of your not being exceedingly comfortable with Mrs . Goddard ."
austen#"She loves piquet , you know ; but when she is gone home , I am afraid you will be sitting up by yourself , instead of going to bed at your usual time -- and the idea of that would entirely destroy my comfort . You must promise me not to sit up ."" He did , on the condition of some promises on her side : such as that , if she came home cold , she would be sure to warm herself thoroughly ; if hungry , that she would take something to eat ; that her own maid should sit up for her ; and that Serle and the butler should see that every thing were safe in the house , as usual . CHAPTER VIII Frank Churchill came back again ; and if he kept his father ' s dinner waiting , it was not known at Hartfield ; for Mrs . Weston was too anxious for his being a favourite with Mr . Woodhouse , to betray any imperfection which could be concealed . He came back , had had his hair cut , and laughed at himself with a very good grace , but without seeming really at all ashamed of what he had done ."
austen#"He had no reason to wish his hair longer , to conceal any confusion of face ; no reason to wish the money unspent , to improve his spirits . He was quite as undaunted and as lively as ever ; and , after seeing him , Emma thus moralised to herself :-- "" I do not know whether it ought to be so , but certainly silly things do cease to be silly if they are done by sensible people in an impudent way . Wickedness is always wickedness , but folly is not always folly .-- It depends upon the character of those who handle it . Mr . Knightley , he is _not_ a trifling , silly young man . If he were , he would have done this differently ."
austen#"He would either have gloried in the achievement , or been ashamed of it . There would have been either the ostentation of a coxcomb , or the evasions of a mind too weak to defend its own vanities .-- No , I am perfectly sure that he is not trifling or silly ."" With Tuesday came the agreeable prospect of seeing him again , and for a longer time than hitherto ; of judging of his general manners , and by inference , of the meaning of his manners towards herself ; of guessing how soon it might be necessary for her to throw coldness into her air ; and of fancying what the observations of all those might be , who were now seeing them together for the first time . She meant to be very happy , in spite of the scene being laid at Mr . Cole ' s ; and without being able to forget that among the failings of Mr . Elton , even in the days of his favour , none had disturbed her more than his propensity to dine with Mr . Cole . Her father ' s comfort was amply secured , Mrs . Bates as well as Mrs . Goddard being able to come ; and her last pleasing duty , before she left the house , was to pay her respects to them as they sat together after dinner ; and while her father was fondly noticing the beauty of her dress , to make the two ladies all the amends in her power , by helping them to large slices of cake and full glasses of wine , for whatever unwilling self - denial his care of their constitution might have obliged them to practise during the meal .-- She had provided a plentiful dinner for them ; she wished she could know that they had been allowed to eat it . She followed another carriage to Mr . Cole ' s door ; and was pleased to see that it was Mr . Knightley ' s ; for Mr . Knightley keeping no horses , having little spare money and a great deal of health , activity , and independence , was too apt , in Emma ' s opinion , to get about as he could , and not use his carriage so often as became the owner of Donwell Abbey ."
austen#"She had an opportunity now of speaking her approbation while warm from her heart , for he stopped to hand her out . "" This is coming as you should do ,"" said she ; "" like a gentleman .-- I am quite glad to see you ."" He thanked her , observing , "" How lucky that we should arrive at the same moment ! for , if we had met first in the drawing - room , I doubt whether you would have discerned me to be more of a gentleman than usual .-- You might not have distinguished how I came , by my look or manner ."" "" Yes I should , I am sure I should . There is always a look of consciousness or bustle when people come in a way which they know to be beneath them ."
austen#"You think you carry it off very well , I dare say , but with you it is a sort of bravado , an air of affected unconcern ; I always observe it whenever I meet you under those circumstances . _Now_ you have nothing to try for . You are not afraid of being supposed ashamed . You are not striving to look taller than any body else . _Now_ I shall really be very happy to walk into the same room with you ."" "" Nonsensical girl !"""
austen#was his reply , but not at all in anger . Emma had as much reason to be satisfied with the rest of the party as with Mr . Knightley . She was received with a cordial respect which could not but please , and given all the consequence she could wish for . When the Westons arrived , the kindest looks of love , the strongest of admiration were for her , from both husband and wife ; the son approached her with a cheerful eagerness which marked her as his peculiar object , and at dinner she found him seated by her -- and , as she firmly believed , not without some dexterity on his side . The party was rather large , as it included one other family , a proper unobjectionable country family , whom the Coles had the advantage of naming among their acquaintance , and the male part of Mr . Cox ' s family , the lawyer of Highbury . The less worthy females were to come in the evening , with Miss Bates , Miss Fairfax , and Miss Smith ; but already , at dinner , they were too numerous for any subject of conversation to be general ; and , while politics and Mr . Elton were talked over , Emma could fairly surrender all her attention to the pleasantness of her neighbour .
austen#"The first remote sound to which she felt herself obliged to attend , was the name of Jane Fairfax . Mrs . Cole seemed to be relating something of her that was expected to be very interesting . She listened , and found it well worth listening to . That very dear part of Emma , her fancy , received an amusing supply . Mrs . Cole was telling that she had been calling on Miss Bates , and as soon as she entered the room had been struck by the sight of a pianoforte -- a very elegant looking instrument -- not a grand , but a large - sized square pianoforte ; and the substance of the story , the end of all the dialogue which ensued of surprize , and inquiry , and congratulations on her side , and explanations on Miss Bates ' s , was , that this pianoforte had arrived from Broadwood ' s the day before , to the great astonishment of both aunt and niece -- entirely unexpected ; that at first , by Miss Bates ' s account , Jane herself was quite at a loss , quite bewildered to think who could possibly have ordered it -- but now , they were both perfectly satisfied that it could be from only one quarter ;-- of course it must be from Colonel Campbell . "" One can suppose nothing else ,"" added Mrs . Cole , "" and I was only surprized that there could ever have been a doubt ."
austen#"But Jane , it seems , had a letter from them very lately , and not a word was said about it . She knows their ways best ; but I should not consider their silence as any reason for their not meaning to make the present . They might chuse to surprize her ."" Mrs . Cole had many to agree with her ; every body who spoke on the subject was equally convinced that it must come from Colonel Campbell , and equally rejoiced that such a present had been made ; and there were enough ready to speak to allow Emma to think her own way , and still listen to Mrs . Cole . "" I declare , I do not know when I have heard any thing that has given me more satisfaction !-- It always has quite hurt me that Jane Fairfax , who plays so delightfully , should not have an instrument . It seemed quite a shame , especially considering how many houses there are where fine instruments are absolutely thrown away ."
austen#"This is like giving ourselves a slap , to be sure ! and it was but yesterday I was telling Mr . Cole , I really was ashamed to look at our new grand pianoforte in the drawing - room , while I do not know one note from another , and our little girls , who are but just beginning , perhaps may never make any thing of it ; and there is poor Jane Fairfax , who is mistress of music , has not any thing of the nature of an instrument , not even the pitifullest old spinet in the world , to amuse herself with .-- I was saying this to Mr . Cole but yesterday , and he quite agreed with me ; only he is so particularly fond of music that he could not help indulging himself in the purchase , hoping that some of our good neighbours might be so obliging occasionally to put it to a better use than we can ; and that really is the reason why the instrument was bought -- or else I am sure we ought to be ashamed of it .-- We are in great hopes that Miss Woodhouse may be prevailed with to try it this evening ."" Miss Woodhouse made the proper acquiescence ; and finding that nothing more was to be entrapped from any communication of Mrs . Cole ' s , turned to Frank Churchill . "" Why do you smile ?"" said she . "" Nay , why do you ?"""
austen#""" Me !-- I suppose I smile for pleasure at Colonel Campbell ' s being so rich and so liberal .-- It is a handsome present ."" "" Very ."" "" I rather wonder that it was never made before ."" "" Perhaps Miss Fairfax has never been staying here so long before ."" "" Or that he did not give her the use of their own instrument -- which must now be shut up in London , untouched by any body ."" "" That is a grand pianoforte , and he might think it too large for Mrs . Bates ' s house ."""
austen#""" You may _say_ what you chuse -- but your countenance testifies that your _thoughts_ on this subject are very much like mine ."" "" I do not know . I rather believe you are giving me more credit for acuteness than I deserve . I smile because you smile , and shall probably suspect whatever I find you suspect ; but at present I do not see what there is to question . If Colonel Campbell is not the person , who can be ?"" "" What do you say to Mrs ."
austen#"Dixon ?"" "" Mrs . Dixon ! very true indeed . I had not thought of Mrs . Dixon . She must know as well as her father , how acceptable an instrument would be ; and perhaps the mode of it , the mystery , the surprize , is more like a young woman ' s scheme than an elderly man ' s . It is Mrs . Dixon , I dare say ."
austen#"I told you that your suspicions would guide mine ."" "" If so , you must extend your suspicions and comprehend _Mr_ . Dixon in them ."" "" Mr . Dixon .-- Very well . Yes , I immediately perceive that it must be the joint present of Mr . and Mrs . Dixon ."
austen#"We were speaking the other day , you know , of his being so warm an admirer of her performance ."" "" Yes , and what you told me on that head , confirmed an idea which I had entertained before .-- I do not mean to reflect upon the good intentions of either Mr . Dixon or Miss Fairfax , but I cannot help suspecting either that , after making his proposals to her friend , he had the misfortune to fall in love with _her_ , or that he became conscious of a little attachment on her side . One might guess twenty things without guessing exactly the right ; but I am sure there must be a particular cause for her chusing to come to Highbury instead of going with the Campbells to Ireland . Here , she must be leading a life of privation and penance ; there it would have been all enjoyment . As to the pretence of trying her native air , I look upon that as a mere excuse .-- In the summer it might have passed ; but what can any body ' s native air do for them in the months of January , February , and March ? Good fires and carriages would be much more to the purpose in most cases of delicate health , and I dare say in her ' s ."
austen#"I do not require you to adopt all my suspicions , though you make so noble a profession of doing it , but I honestly tell you what they are ."" "" And , upon my word , they have an air of great probability . Mr . Dixon ' s preference of her music to her friend ' s , I can answer for being very decided ."" "" And then , he saved her life . Did you ever hear of that ?-- A water party ; and by some accident she was falling overboard . He caught her ."""
austen#""" He did . I was there -- one of the party ."" "" Were you really ?-- Well !-- But you observed nothing of course , for it seems to be a new idea to you .-- If I had been there , I think I should have made some discoveries ."" "" I dare say you would ; but I , simple I , saw nothing but the fact , that Miss Fairfax was nearly dashed from the vessel and that Mr . Dixon caught her .-- It was the work of a moment . And though the consequent shock and alarm was very great and much more durable -- indeed I believe it was half an hour before any of us were comfortable again -- yet that was too general a sensation for any thing of peculiar anxiety to be observable . I do not mean to say , however , that you might not have made discoveries ."""
austen#"The conversation was here interrupted . They were called on to share in the awkwardness of a rather long interval between the courses , and obliged to be as formal and as orderly as the others ; but when the table was again safely covered , when every corner dish was placed exactly right , and occupation and ease were generally restored , Emma said , "" The arrival of this pianoforte is decisive with me . I wanted to know a little more , and this tells me quite enough . Depend upon it , we shall soon hear that it is a present from Mr . and Mrs . Dixon ."""
austen#""" And if the Dixons should absolutely deny all knowledge of it we must conclude it to come from the Campbells ."" "" No , I am sure it is not from the Campbells . Miss Fairfax knows it is not from the Campbells , or they would have been guessed at first . She would not have been puzzled , had she dared fix on them . I may not have convinced you perhaps , but I am perfectly convinced myself that Mr . Dixon is a principal in the business ."" "" Indeed you injure me if you suppose me unconvinced ."
austen#"Your reasonings carry my judgment along with them entirely . At first , while I supposed you satisfied that Colonel Campbell was the giver , I saw it only as paternal kindness , and thought it the most natural thing in the world . But when you mentioned Mrs . Dixon , I felt how much more probable that it should be the tribute of warm female friendship . And now I can see it in no other light than as an offering of love ."" There was no occasion to press the matter farther . The conviction seemed real ; he looked as if he felt it ."
austen#She said no more , other subjects took their turn ; and the rest of the dinner passed away ; the dessert succeeded , the children came in , and were talked to and admired amid the usual rate of conversation ; a few clever things said , a few downright silly , but by much the larger proportion neither the one nor the other -- nothing worse than everyday remarks , dull repetitions , old news , and heavy jokes . The ladies had not been long in the drawing - room , before the other ladies , in their different divisions , arrived . Emma watched the entree of her own particular little friend ; and if she could not exult in her dignity and grace , she could not only love the blooming sweetness and the artless manner , but could most heartily rejoice in that light , cheerful , unsentimental disposition which allowed her so many alleviations of pleasure , in the midst of the pangs of disappointed affection . There she sat -- and who would have guessed how many tears she had been lately shedding ? To be in company , nicely dressed herself and seeing others nicely dressed , to sit and smile and look pretty , and say nothing , was enough for the happiness of the present hour . Jane Fairfax did look and move superior ; but Emma suspected she might have been glad to change feelings with Harriet , very glad to have purchased the mortification of having loved -- yes , of having loved even Mr . Elton in vain -- by the surrender of all the dangerous pleasure of knowing herself beloved by the husband of her friend .
austen#"In so large a party it was not necessary that Emma should approach her . She did not wish to speak of the pianoforte , she felt too much in the secret herself , to think the appearance of curiosity or interest fair , and therefore purposely kept at a distance ; but by the others , the subject was almost immediately introduced , and she saw the blush of consciousness with which congratulations were received , the blush of guilt which accompanied the name of "" my excellent friend Colonel Campbell ."" Mrs . Weston , kind - hearted and musical , was particularly interested by the circumstance , and Emma could not help being amused at her perseverance in dwelling on the subject ; and having so much to ask and to say as to tone , touch , and pedal , totally unsuspicious of that wish of saying as little about it as possible , which she plainly read in the fair heroine ' s countenance . They were soon joined by some of the gentlemen ; and the very first of the early was Frank Churchill . In he walked , the first and the handsomest ; and after paying his compliments en passant to Miss Bates and her niece , made his way directly to the opposite side of the circle , where sat Miss Woodhouse ; and till he could find a seat by her , would not sit at all . Emma divined what every body present must be thinking ."
austen#"She was his object , and every body must perceive it . She introduced him to her friend , Miss Smith , and , at convenient moments afterwards , heard what each thought of the other . "" He had never seen so lovely a face , and was delighted with her naivete ."" And she , "" Only to be sure it was paying him too great a compliment , but she did think there were some looks a little like Mr . Elton ."" Emma restrained her indignation , and only turned from her in silence ."
austen#Smiles of intelligence passed between her and the gentleman on first glancing towards Miss Fairfax ; but it was most prudent to avoid speech . He told her that he had been impatient to leave the dining - room -- hated sitting long -- was always the first to move when he could -- that his father , Mr . Knightley , Mr . Cox , and Mr . Cole , were left very busy over parish business -- that as long as he had staid , however , it had been pleasant enough , as he had found them in general a set of gentlemanlike , sensible men ; and spoke so handsomely of Highbury altogether -- thought it so abundant in agreeable families -- that Emma began to feel she had been used to despise the place rather too much . She questioned him as to the society in Yorkshire -- the extent of the neighbourhood about Enscombe , and the sort ; and could make out from his answers that , as far as Enscombe was concerned , there was very little going on , that their visitings were among a range of great families , none very near ; and that even when days were fixed , and invitations accepted , it was an even chance that Mrs . Churchill were not in health and spirits for going ; that they made a point of visiting no fresh person ; and that , though he had his separate engagements , it was not without difficulty , without considerable address _at_ _times_ , that he could get away , or introduce an acquaintance for a night . She saw that Enscombe could not satisfy , and that Highbury , taken at its best , might reasonably please a young man who had more retirement at home than he liked . His importance at Enscombe was very evident . He did not boast , but it naturally betrayed itself , that he had persuaded his aunt where his uncle could do nothing , and on her laughing and noticing it , he owned that he believed ( excepting one or two points ) he could _with_ _time_ persuade her to any thing .
austen#"One of those points on which his influence failed , he then mentioned . He had wanted very much to go abroad -- had been very eager indeed to be allowed to travel -- but she would not hear of it . This had happened the year before . _Now_ , he said , he was beginning to have no longer the same wish . The unpersuadable point , which he did not mention , Emma guessed to be good behaviour to his father . "" I have made a most wretched discovery ,"" said he , after a short pause .-- "" I have been here a week to - morrow -- half my time ."
austen#"I never knew days fly so fast . A week to - morrow !-- And I have hardly begun to enjoy myself . But just got acquainted with Mrs . Weston , and others !-- I hate the recollection ."" "" Perhaps you may now begin to regret that you spent one whole day , out of so few , in having your hair cut ."" "" No ,"" said he , smiling , "" that is no subject of regret at all . I have no pleasure in seeing my friends , unless I can believe myself fit to be seen ."""
austen#"The rest of the gentlemen being now in the room , Emma found herself obliged to turn from him for a few minutes , and listen to Mr . Cole . When Mr . Cole had moved away , and her attention could be restored as before , she saw Frank Churchill looking intently across the room at Miss Fairfax , who was sitting exactly opposite . "" What is the matter ?"" said she . He started . "" Thank you for rousing me ,"" he replied ."
austen#""" I believe I have been very rude ; but really Miss Fairfax has done her hair in so odd a way -- so very odd a way -- that I cannot keep my eyes from her . I never saw any thing so outree !-- Those curls !-- This must be a fancy of her own . I see nobody else looking like her !-- I must go and ask her whether it is an Irish fashion . Shall I ?-- Yes , I will -- I declare I will -- and you shall see how she takes it ;-- whether she colours ."" He was gone immediately ; and Emma soon saw him standing before Miss Fairfax , and talking to her ; but as to its effect on the young lady , as he had improvidently placed himself exactly between them , exactly in front of Miss Fairfax , she could absolutely distinguish nothing . Before he could return to his chair , it was taken by Mrs . Weston ."
austen#""" This is the luxury of a large party ,"" said she :--"" one can get near every body , and say every thing . My dear Emma , I am longing to talk to you . I have been making discoveries and forming plans , just like yourself , and I must tell them while the idea is fresh . Do you know how Miss Bates and her niece came here ?"" "" How ?-- They were invited , were not they ?"" "" Oh !"
austen#"yes -- but how they were conveyed hither ?-- the manner of their coming ?"" "" They walked , I conclude . How else could they come ?"" "" Very true .-- Well , a little while ago it occurred to me how very sad it would be to have Jane Fairfax walking home again , late at night , and cold as the nights are now . And as I looked at her , though I never saw her appear to more advantage , it struck me that she was heated , and would therefore be particularly liable to take cold . Poor girl !"
austen#I could not bear the idea of it ; so , as soon as Mr . Weston came into the room , and I could get at him , I spoke to him about the carriage . You may guess how readily he came into my wishes ; and having his approbation , I made my way directly to Miss Bates , to assure her that the carriage would be at her service before it took us home ; for I thought it would be making her comfortable at once . Good soul ! she was as grateful as possible , you may be sure . ` Nobody was ever so fortunate as herself !' -- but with many , many thanks --` there was no occasion to trouble us , for Mr . Knightley ' s carriage had brought , and was to take them home again .'
austen#"I was quite surprized ;-- very glad , I am sure ; but really quite surprized . Such a very kind attention -- and so thoughtful an attention !-- the sort of thing that so few men would think of . And , in short , from knowing his usual ways , I am very much inclined to think that it was for their accommodation the carriage was used at all . I do suspect he would not have had a pair of horses for himself , and that it was only as an excuse for assisting them ."" "" Very likely ,"" said Emma --"" nothing more likely . I know no man more likely than Mr . Knightley to do the sort of thing -- to do any thing really good - natured , useful , considerate , or benevolent ."
austen#"He is not a gallant man , but he is a very humane one ; and this , considering Jane Fairfax ' s ill - health , would appear a case of humanity to him ;-- and for an act of unostentatious kindness , there is nobody whom I would fix on more than on Mr . Knightley . I know he had horses to - day -- for we arrived together ; and I laughed at him about it , but he said not a word that could betray ."" "" Well ,"" said Mrs . Weston , smiling , "" you give him credit for more simple , disinterested benevolence in this instance than I do ; for while Miss Bates was speaking , a suspicion darted into my head , and I have never been able to get it out again . The more I think of it , the more probable it appears . In short , I have made a match between Mr . Knightley and Jane Fairfax . See the consequence of keeping you company !-- What do you say to it ?"""
austen#""" Mr . Knightley and Jane Fairfax !"" exclaimed Emma . "" Dear Mrs . Weston , how could you think of such a thing ?-- Mr . Knightley !-- Mr . Knightley must not marry !-- You would not have little Henry cut out from Donwell ?-- Oh ! no , no , Henry must have Donwell ."
austen#"I cannot at all consent to Mr . Knightley ' s marrying ; and I am sure it is not at all likely . I am amazed that you should think of such a thing ."" "" My dear Emma , I have told you what led me to think of it . I do not want the match -- I do not want to injure dear little Henry -- but the idea has been given me by circumstances ; and if Mr . Knightley really wished to marry , you would not have him refrain on Henry ' s account , a boy of six years old , who knows nothing of the matter ?"" "" Yes , I would . I could not bear to have Henry supplanted .-- Mr . Knightley marry !-- No , I have never had such an idea , and I cannot adopt it now ."
austen#"And Jane Fairfax , too , of all women !"" "" Nay , she has always been a first favourite with him , as you very well know ."" "" But the imprudence of such a match !"" "" I am not speaking of its prudence ; merely its probability ."" "" I see no probability in it , unless you have any better foundation than what you mention . His good - nature , his humanity , as I tell you , would be quite enough to account for the horses ."
austen#"He has a great regard for the Bateses , you know , independent of Jane Fairfax -- and is always glad to shew them attention . My dear Mrs . Weston , do not take to match - making . You do it very ill . Jane Fairfax mistress of the Abbey !-- Oh ! no , no ;-- every feeling revolts . For his own sake , I would not have him do so mad a thing ."" "" Imprudent , if you please -- but not mad ."
austen#"Excepting inequality of fortune , and perhaps a little disparity of age , I can see nothing unsuitable ."" "" But Mr . Knightley does not want to marry . I am sure he has not the least idea of it . Do not put it into his head . Why should he marry ?-- He is as happy as possible by himself ; with his farm , and his sheep , and his library , and all the parish to manage ; and he is extremely fond of his brother ' s children . He has no occasion to marry , either to fill up his time or his heart ."""
austen#""" My dear Emma , as long as he thinks so , it is so ; but if he really loves Jane Fairfax --"" "" Nonsense ! He does not care about Jane Fairfax . In the way of love , I am sure he does not . He would do any good to her , or her family ; but --"" "" Well ,"" said Mrs . Weston , laughing , "" perhaps the greatest good he could do them , would be to give Jane such a respectable home ."""
austen#""" If it would be good to her , I am sure it would be evil to himself ; a very shameful and degrading connexion . How would he bear to have Miss Bates belonging to him ?-- To have her haunting the Abbey , and thanking him all day long for his great kindness in marrying Jane ?-- ` So very kind and obliging !-- But he always had been such a very kind neighbour !' And then fly off , through half a sentence , to her mother ' s old petticoat . ` Not that it was such a very old petticoat either -- for still it would last a great while -- and , indeed , she must thankfully say that their petticoats were all very strong .'"" "" For shame , Emma ! Do not mimic her ."
austen#You divert me against my conscience . And , upon my word , I do not think Mr . Knightley would be much disturbed by Miss Bates . Little things do not irritate him . She might talk on ; and if he wanted to say any thing himself , he would only talk louder , and drown her voice . But the question is not , whether it would be a bad connexion for him , but whether he wishes it ; and I think he does . I have heard him speak , and so must you , so very highly of Jane Fairfax !
austen#The interest he takes in her -- his anxiety about her health -- his concern that she should have no happier prospect ! I have heard him express himself so warmly on those points !-- Such an admirer of her performance on the pianoforte , and of her voice ! I have heard him say that he could listen to her for ever . Oh ! and I had almost forgotten one idea that occurred to me -- this pianoforte that has been sent here by somebody -- though we have all been so well satisfied to consider it a present from the Campbells , may it not be from Mr . Knightley ? I cannot help suspecting him .
austen#"I think he is just the person to do it , even without being in love ."" "" Then it can be no argument to prove that he is in love . But I do not think it is at all a likely thing for him to do . Mr . Knightley does nothing mysteriously ."" "" I have heard him lamenting her having no instrument repeatedly ; oftener than I should suppose such a circumstance would , in the common course of things , occur to him ."" "" Very well ; and if he had intended to give her one , he would have told her so ."""
austen#""" There might be scruples of delicacy , my dear Emma . I have a very strong notion that it comes from him . I am sure he was particularly silent when Mrs . Cole told us of it at dinner ."" "" You take up an idea , Mrs . Weston , and run away with it ; as you have many a time reproached me with doing . I see no sign of attachment -- I believe nothing of the pianoforte -- and proof only shall convince me that Mr . Knightley has any thought of marrying Jane Fairfax ."" They combated the point some time longer in the same way ; Emma rather gaining ground over the mind of her friend ; for Mrs . Weston was the most used of the two to yield ; till a little bustle in the room shewed them that tea was over , and the instrument in preparation ;-- and at the same moment Mr . Cole approaching to entreat Miss Woodhouse would do them the honour of trying it ."
austen#Frank Churchill , of whom , in the eagerness of her conversation with Mrs . Weston , she had been seeing nothing , except that he had found a seat by Miss Fairfax , followed Mr . Cole , to add his very pressing entreaties ; and as , in every respect , it suited Emma best to lead , she gave a very proper compliance . She knew the limitations of her own powers too well to attempt more than she could perform with credit ; she wanted neither taste nor spirit in the little things which are generally acceptable , and could accompany her own voice well . One accompaniment to her song took her agreeably by surprize -- a second , slightly but correctly taken by Frank Churchill . Her pardon was duly begged at the close of the song , and every thing usual followed . He was accused of having a delightful voice , and a perfect knowledge of music ; which was properly denied ; and that he knew nothing of the matter , and had no voice at all , roundly asserted . They sang together once more ; and Emma would then resign her place to Miss Fairfax , whose performance , both vocal and instrumental , she never could attempt to conceal from herself , was infinitely superior to her own .
austen#With mixed feelings , she seated herself at a little distance from the numbers round the instrument , to listen . Frank Churchill sang again . They had sung together once or twice , it appeared , at Weymouth . But the sight of Mr . Knightley among the most attentive , soon drew away half Emma ' s mind ; and she fell into a train of thinking on the subject of Mrs . Weston ' s suspicions , to which the sweet sounds of the united voices gave only momentary interruptions . Her objections to Mr . Knightley ' s marrying did not in the least subside . She could see nothing but evil in it .
austen#It would be a great disappointment to Mr . John Knightley ; consequently to Isabella . A real injury to the children -- a most mortifying change , and material loss to them all ;-- a very great deduction from her father ' s daily comfort -- and , as to herself , she could not at all endure the idea of Jane Fairfax at Donwell Abbey . A Mrs . Knightley for them all to give way to !-- No -- Mr . Knightley must never marry . Little Henry must remain the heir of Donwell . Presently Mr . Knightley looked back , and came and sat down by her .
austen#"They talked at first only of the performance . His admiration was certainly very warm ; yet she thought , but for Mrs . Weston , it would not have struck her . As a sort of touchstone , however , she began to speak of his kindness in conveying the aunt and niece ; and though his answer was in the spirit of cutting the matter short , she believed it to indicate only his disinclination to dwell on any kindness of his own . "" I often feel concern ,"" said she , "" that I dare not make our carriage more useful on such occasions . It is not that I am without the wish ; but you know how impossible my father would deem it that James should put - to for such a purpose ."" "" Quite out of the question , quite out of the question ,"" he replied ;-- "" but you must often wish it , I am sure ."""
austen#"And he smiled with such seeming pleasure at the conviction , that she must proceed another step . "" This present from the Campbells ,"" said she --"" this pianoforte is very kindly given ."" "" Yes ,"" he replied , and without the smallest apparent embarrassment .-- "" But they would have done better had they given her notice of it . Surprizes are foolish things . The pleasure is not enhanced , and the inconvenience is often considerable . I should have expected better judgment in Colonel Campbell ."""
austen#"From that moment , Emma could have taken her oath that Mr . Knightley had had no concern in giving the instrument . But whether he were entirely free from peculiar attachment -- whether there were no actual preference -- remained a little longer doubtful . Towards the end of Jane ' s second song , her voice grew thick . "" That will do ,"" said he , when it was finished , thinking aloud -- "" you have sung quite enough for one evening -- now be quiet ."" Another song , however , was soon begged for . "" One more ;-- they would not fatigue Miss Fairfax on any account , and would only ask for one more ."""
austen#"And Frank Churchill was heard to say , "" I think you could manage this without effort ; the first part is so very trifling . The strength of the song falls on the second ."" Mr . Knightley grew angry . "" That fellow ,"" said he , indignantly , "" thinks of nothing but shewing off his own voice . This must not be ."" And touching Miss Bates , who at that moment passed near --"" Miss Bates , are you mad , to let your niece sing herself hoarse in this manner ?"
austen#"Go , and interfere . They have no mercy on her ."" Miss Bates , in her real anxiety for Jane , could hardly stay even to be grateful , before she stept forward and put an end to all farther singing . Here ceased the concert part of the evening , for Miss Woodhouse and Miss Fairfax were the only young lady performers ; but soon ( within five minutes ) the proposal of dancing -- originating nobody exactly knew where -- was so effectually promoted by Mr . and Mrs . Cole , that every thing was rapidly clearing away , to give proper space . Mrs . Weston , capital in her country - dances , was seated , and beginning an irresistible waltz ; and Frank Churchill , coming up with most becoming gallantry to Emma , had secured her hand , and led her up to the top . While waiting till the other young people could pair themselves off , Emma found time , in spite of the compliments she was receiving on her voice and her taste , to look about , and see what became of Mr . Knightley ."
austen#This would be a trial . He was no dancer in general . If he were to be very alert in engaging Jane Fairfax now , it might augur something . There was no immediate appearance . No ; he was talking to Mrs . Cole -- he was looking on unconcerned ; Jane was asked by somebody else , and he was still talking to Mrs . Cole . Emma had no longer an alarm for Henry ; his interest was yet safe ; and she led off the dance with genuine spirit and enjoyment .
austen#"Not more than five couple could be mustered ; but the rarity and the suddenness of it made it very delightful , and she found herself well matched in a partner . They were a couple worth looking at . Two dances , unfortunately , were all that could be allowed . It was growing late , and Miss Bates became anxious to get home , on her mother ' s account . After some attempts , therefore , to be permitted to begin again , they were obliged to thank Mrs . Weston , look sorrowful , and have done . "" Perhaps it is as well ,"" said Frank Churchill , as he attended Emma to her carriage ."
austen#""" I must have asked Miss Fairfax , and her languid dancing would not have agreed with me , after your ' s ."" CHAPTER IX Emma did not repent her condescension in going to the Coles . The visit afforded her many pleasant recollections the next day ; and all that she might be supposed to have lost on the side of dignified seclusion , must be amply repaid in the splendour of popularity . She must have delighted the Coles -- worthy people , who deserved to be made happy !-- And left a name behind her that would not soon die away . Perfect happiness , even in memory , is not common ; and there were two points on which she was not quite easy ."
austen#She doubted whether she had not transgressed the duty of woman by woman , in betraying her suspicions of Jane Fairfax ' s feelings to Frank Churchill . It was hardly right ; but it had been so strong an idea , that it would escape her , and his submission to all that she told , was a compliment to her penetration , which made it difficult for her to be quite certain that she ought to have held her tongue . The other circumstance of regret related also to Jane Fairfax ; and there she had no doubt . She did unfeignedly and unequivocally regret the inferiority of her own playing and singing . She did most heartily grieve over the idleness of her childhood -- and sat down and practised vigorously an hour and a half . She was then interrupted by Harriet ' s coming in ; and if Harriet ' s praise could have satisfied her , she might soon have been comforted .
austen#""" Oh ! if I could but play as well as you and Miss Fairfax !"" "" Don ' t class us together , Harriet . My playing is no more like her ' s , than a lamp is like sunshine ."" "" Oh ! dear -- I think you play the best of the two ."
austen#"I think you play quite as well as she does . I am sure I had much rather hear you . Every body last night said how well you played ."" "" Those who knew any thing about it , must have felt the difference . The truth is , Harriet , that my playing is just good enough to be praised , but Jane Fairfax ' s is much beyond it ."" "" Well , I always shall think that you play quite as well as she does , or that if there is any difference nobody would ever find it out ."
austen#"Mr . Cole said how much taste you had ; and Mr . Frank Churchill talked a great deal about your taste , and that he valued taste much more than execution ."" "" Ah ! but Jane Fairfax has them both , Harriet ."" "" Are you sure ? I saw she had execution , but I did not know she had any taste . Nobody talked about it ."
austen#"And I hate Italian singing .-- There is no understanding a word of it . Besides , if she does play so very well , you know , it is no more than she is obliged to do , because she will have to teach . The Coxes were wondering last night whether she would get into any great family . How did you think the Coxes looked ?"" "" Just as they always do -- very vulgar ."" "" They told me something ,"" said Harriet rather hesitatingly ;"" but it is nothing of any consequence ."""
austen#"Emma was obliged to ask what they had told her , though fearful of its producing Mr . Elton . "" They told me -- that Mr . Martin dined with them last Saturday ."" "" Oh !"" "" He came to their father upon some business , and he asked him to stay to dinner ."" "" Oh !"" "" They talked a great deal about him , especially Anne Cox ."
austen#"I do not know what she meant , but she asked me if I thought I should go and stay there again next summer ."" "" She meant to be impertinently curious , just as such an Anne Cox should be ."" "" She said he was very agreeable the day he dined there . He sat by her at dinner . Miss Nash thinks either of the Coxes would be very glad to marry him ."" "" Very likely .-- I think they are , without exception , the most vulgar girls in Highbury ."""
austen#Harriet had business at Ford ' s .-- Emma thought it most prudent to go with her . Another accidental meeting with the Martins was possible , and in her present state , would be dangerous . Harriet , tempted by every thing and swayed by half a word , was always very long at a purchase ; and while she was still hanging over muslins and changing her mind , Emma went to the door for amusement .-- Much could not be hoped from the traffic of even the busiest part of Highbury ;-- Mr . Perry walking hastily by , Mr . William Cox letting himself in at the office - door , Mr . Cole ' s carriage - horses returning from exercise , or a stray letter - boy on an obstinate mule , were the liveliest objects she could presume to expect ; and when her eyes fell only on the butcher with his tray , a tidy old woman travelling homewards from shop with her full basket , two curs quarrelling over a dirty bone , and a string of dawdling children round the baker ' s little bow - window eyeing the gingerbread , she knew she had no reason to complain , and was amused enough ; quite enough still to stand at the door . A mind lively and at ease , can do with seeing nothing , and can see nothing that does not answer . She looked down the Randalls road . The scene enlarged ; two persons appeared ; Mrs . Weston and her son - in - law ; they were walking into Highbury ;-- to Hartfield of course .
austen#"They were stopping , however , in the first place at Mrs . Bates ' s ; whose house was a little nearer Randalls than Ford ' s ; and had all but knocked , when Emma caught their eye .-- Immediately they crossed the road and came forward to her ; and the agreeableness of yesterday ' s engagement seemed to give fresh pleasure to the present meeting . Mrs . Weston informed her that she was going to call on the Bateses , in order to hear the new instrument . "" For my companion tells me ,"" said she , "" that I absolutely promised Miss Bates last night , that I would come this morning . I was not aware of it myself . I did not know that I had fixed a day , but as he says I did , I am going now ."" "" And while Mrs . Weston pays her visit , I may be allowed , I hope ,"" said Frank Churchill , "" to join your party and wait for her at Hartfield -- if you are going home ."""
austen#"Mrs . Weston was disappointed . "" I thought you meant to go with me . They would be very much pleased ."" "" Me ! I should be quite in the way . But , perhaps -- I may be equally in the way here ."
austen#"Miss Woodhouse looks as if she did not want me . My aunt always sends me off when she is shopping . She says I fidget her to death ; and Miss Woodhouse looks as if she could almost say the same . What am I to do ?"" "" I am here on no business of my own ,"" said Emma ; "" I am only waiting for my friend . She will probably have soon done , and then we shall go home ."
austen#"But you had better go with Mrs . Weston and hear the instrument ."" "" Well -- if you advise it .-- But ( with a smile ) if Colonel Campbell should have employed a careless friend , and if it should prove to have an indifferent tone -- what shall I say ? I shall be no support to Mrs . Weston . She might do very well by herself . A disagreeable truth would be palatable through her lips , but I am the wretchedest being in the world at a civil falsehood ."" "" I do not believe any such thing ,"" replied Emma .--"" I am persuaded that you can be as insincere as your neighbours , when it is necessary ; but there is no reason to suppose the instrument is indifferent ."
austen#"Quite otherwise indeed , if I understood Miss Fairfax ' s opinion last night ."" "" Do come with me ,"" said Mrs . Weston , "" if it be not very disagreeable to you . It need not detain us long . We will go to Hartfield afterwards . We will follow them to Hartfield . I really wish you to call with me ."
austen#"It will be felt so great an attention ! and I always thought you meant it ."" He could say no more ; and with the hope of Hartfield to reward him , returned with Mrs . Weston to Mrs . Bates ' s door . Emma watched them in , and then joined Harriet at the interesting counter ,-- trying , with all the force of her own mind , to convince her that if she wanted plain muslin it was of no use to look at figured ; and that a blue ribbon , be it ever so beautiful , would still never match her yellow pattern . At last it was all settled , even to the destination of the parcel . "" Should I send it to Mrs . Goddard ' s , ma ' am ?"""
austen#"asked Mrs . Ford .-- "" Yes -- no -- yes , to Mrs . Goddard ' s . Only my pattern gown is at Hartfield . No , you shall send it to Hartfield , if you please . But then , Mrs . Goddard will want to see it .-- And I could take the pattern gown home any day . But I shall want the ribbon directly -- so it had better go to Hartfield -- at least the ribbon ."
austen#"You could make it into two parcels , Mrs . Ford , could not you ?"" "" It is not worth while , Harriet , to give Mrs . Ford the trouble of two parcels ."" "" No more it is ."" "" No trouble in the world , ma ' am ,"" said the obliging Mrs . Ford . "" Oh ! but indeed I would much rather have it only in one ."
austen#"Then , if you please , you shall send it all to Mrs . Goddard ' s -- I do not know -- No , I think , Miss Woodhouse , I may just as well have it sent to Hartfield , and take it home with me at night . What do you advise ?"" "" That you do not give another half - second to the subject . To Hartfield , if you please , Mrs . Ford ."" "" Aye , that will be much best ,"" said Harriet , quite satisfied , "" I should not at all like to have it sent to Mrs ."
austen#"Goddard ' s ."" Voices approached the shop -- or rather one voice and two ladies : Mrs . Weston and Miss Bates met them at the door . "" My dear Miss Woodhouse ,"" said the latter , "" I am just run across to entreat the favour of you to come and sit down with us a little while , and give us your opinion of our new instrument ; you and Miss Smith . How do you do , Miss Smith ?-- Very well I thank you .-- And I begged Mrs . Weston to come with me , that I might be sure of succeeding ."" "" I hope Mrs . Bates and Miss Fairfax are --"" "" Very well , I am much obliged to you ."
austen#My mother is delightfully well ; and Jane caught no cold last night . How is Mr . Woodhouse ?-- I am so glad to hear such a good account . Mrs . Weston told me you were here .-- Oh ! then , said I , I must run across , I am sure Miss Woodhouse will allow me just to run across and entreat her to come in ; my mother will be so very happy to see her -- and now we are such a nice party , she cannot refuse .--` Aye , pray do ,' said Mr . Frank Churchill , ` Miss Woodhouse ' s opinion of the instrument will be worth having .' -- But , said I , I shall be more sure of succeeding if one of you will go with me .--` Oh ,' said he , ` wait half a minute , till I have finished my job ;'-- For , would you believe it , Miss Woodhouse , there he is , in the most obliging manner in the world , fastening in the rivet of my mother ' s spectacles .-- The rivet came out , you know , this morning .-- So very obliging !-- For my mother had no use of her spectacles -- could not put them on .
austen#And , by the bye , every body ought to have two pair of spectacles ; they should indeed . Jane said so . I meant to take them over to John Saunders the first thing I did , but something or other hindered me all the morning ; first one thing , then another , there is no saying what , you know . At one time Patty came to say she thought the kitchen chimney wanted sweeping . Oh , said I , Patty do not come with your bad news to me . Here is the rivet of your mistress ' s spectacles out .
austen#Then the baked apples came home , Mrs . Wallis sent them by her boy ; they are extremely civil and obliging to us , the Wallises , always -- I have heard some people say that Mrs . Wallis can be uncivil and give a very rude answer , but we have never known any thing but the greatest attention from them . And it cannot be for the value of our custom now , for what is our consumption of bread , you know ? Only three of us .-- besides dear Jane at present -- and she really eats nothing -- makes such a shocking breakfast , you would be quite frightened if you saw it . I dare not let my mother know how little she eats -- so I say one thing and then I say another , and it passes off . But about the middle of the day she gets hungry , and there is nothing she likes so well as these baked apples , and they are extremely wholesome , for I took the opportunity the other day of asking Mr . Perry ; I happened to meet him in the street . Not that I had any doubt before -- I have so often heard Mr . Woodhouse recommend a baked apple .
austen#"I believe it is the only way that Mr . Woodhouse thinks the fruit thoroughly wholesome . We have apple - dumplings , however , very often . Patty makes an excellent apple - dumpling . Well , Mrs . Weston , you have prevailed , I hope , and these ladies will oblige us ."" Emma would be "" very happy to wait on Mrs . Bates , & c .,"" and they did at last move out of the shop , with no farther delay from Miss Bates than , "" How do you do , Mrs . Ford ?"
austen#"I beg your pardon . I did not see you before . I hear you have a charming collection of new ribbons from town . Jane came back delighted yesterday . Thank ye , the gloves do very well -- only a little too large about the wrist ; but Jane is taking them in ."" "" What was I talking of ?"""
austen#"said she , beginning again when they were all in the street . Emma wondered on what , of all the medley , she would fix . "" I declare I cannot recollect what I was talking of .-- Oh ! my mother ' s spectacles . So very obliging of Mr . Frank Churchill ! ` Oh !'"
austen#said he , ` I do think I can fasten the rivet ; I like a job of this kind excessively .' -- Which you know shewed him to be so very . . . . Indeed I must say that , much as I had heard of him before and much as I had expected , he very far exceeds any thing .
austen#. . . I do congratulate you , Mrs . Weston , most warmly . He seems every thing the fondest parent could . .
austen#. . ` Oh !' said he , ` I can fasten the rivet . I like a job of that sort excessively .' I never shall forget his manner .
austen#And when I brought out the baked apples from the closet , and hoped our friends would be so very obliging as to take some , ` Oh !' said he directly , ` there is nothing in the way of fruit half so good , and these are the finest - looking home - baked apples I ever saw in my life .' That , you know , was so very . . . .
austen#And I am sure , by his manner , it was no compliment . Indeed they are very delightful apples , and Mrs . Wallis does them full justice -- only we do not have them baked more than twice , and Mr . Woodhouse made us promise to have them done three times -- but Miss Woodhouse will be so good as not to mention it . The apples themselves are the very finest sort for baking , beyond a doubt ; all from Donwell -- some of Mr . Knightley ' s most liberal supply . He sends us a sack every year ; and certainly there never was such a keeping apple anywhere as one of his trees -- I believe there is two of them . My mother says the orchard was always famous in her younger days . But I was really quite shocked the other day -- for Mr . Knightley called one morning , and Jane was eating these apples , and we talked about them and said how much she enjoyed them , and he asked whether we were not got to the end of our stock .
austen#` I am sure you must be ,' said he , ` and I will send you another supply ; for I have a great many more than I can ever use . William Larkins let me keep a larger quantity than usual this year . I will send you some more , before they get good for nothing .' So I begged he would not -- for really as to ours being gone , I could not absolutely say that we had a great many left -- it was but half a dozen indeed ; but they should be all kept for Jane ; and I could not at all bear that he should be sending us more , so liberal as he had been already ; and Jane said the same . And when he was gone , she almost quarrelled with me -- No , I should not say quarrelled , for we never had a quarrel in our lives ; but she was quite distressed that I had owned the apples were so nearly gone ; she wished I had made him believe we had a great many left . Oh , said I , my dear , I did say as much as I could .
austen#However , the very same evening William Larkins came over with a large basket of apples , the same sort of apples , a bushel at least , and I was very much obliged , and went down and spoke to William Larkins and said every thing , as you may suppose . William Larkins is such an old acquaintance ! I am always glad to see him . But , however , I found afterwards from Patty , that William said it was all the apples of _that_ sort his master had ; he had brought them all -- and now his master had not one left to bake or boil . William did not seem to mind it himself , he was so pleased to think his master had sold so many ; for William , you know , thinks more of his master ' s profit than any thing ; but Mrs . Hodges , he said , was quite displeased at their being all sent away . She could not bear that her master should not be able to have another apple - tart this spring .
austen#He told Patty this , but bid her not mind it , and be sure not to say any thing to us about it , for Mrs . Hodges _would_ be cross sometimes , and as long as so many sacks were sold , it did not signify who ate the remainder . And so Patty told me , and I was excessively shocked indeed ! I would not have Mr . Knightley know any thing about it for the world ! He would be so very . . .
austen#". I wanted to keep it from Jane ' s knowledge ; but , unluckily , I had mentioned it before I was aware ."" Miss Bates had just done as Patty opened the door ; and her visitors walked upstairs without having any regular narration to attend to , pursued only by the sounds of her desultory good - will . "" Pray take care , Mrs . Weston , there is a step at the turning . Pray take care , Miss Woodhouse , ours is rather a dark staircase -- rather darker and narrower than one could wish . Miss Smith , pray take care ."
austen#"Miss Woodhouse , I am quite concerned , I am sure you hit your foot . Miss Smith , the step at the turning ."" CHAPTER X The appearance of the little sitting - room as they entered , was tranquillity itself ; Mrs . Bates , deprived of her usual employment , slumbering on one side of the fire , Frank Churchill , at a table near her , most deedily occupied about her spectacles , and Jane Fairfax , standing with her back to them , intent on her pianoforte . Busy as he was , however , the young man was yet able to shew a most happy countenance on seeing Emma again . "" This is a pleasure ,"" said he , in rather a low voice , "" coming at least ten minutes earlier than I had calculated ."
austen#"You find me trying to be useful ; tell me if you think I shall succeed ."" "" What !"" said Mrs . Weston , "" have not you finished it yet ? you would not earn a very good livelihood as a working silversmith at this rate ."" "" I have not been working uninterruptedly ,"" he replied , "" I have been assisting Miss Fairfax in trying to make her instrument stand steadily , it was not quite firm ; an unevenness in the floor , I believe . You see we have been wedging one leg with paper ."
austen#"This was very kind of you to be persuaded to come . I was almost afraid you would be hurrying home ."" He contrived that she should be seated by him ; and was sufficiently employed in looking out the best baked apple for her , and trying to make her help or advise him in his work , till Jane Fairfax was quite ready to sit down to the pianoforte again . That she was not immediately ready , Emma did suspect to arise from the state of her nerves ; she had not yet possessed the instrument long enough to touch it without emotion ; she must reason herself into the power of performance ; and Emma could not but pity such feelings , whatever their origin , and could not but resolve never to expose them to her neighbour again . At last Jane began , and though the first bars were feebly given , the powers of the instrument were gradually done full justice to . Mrs . Weston had been delighted before , and was delighted again ; Emma joined her in all her praise ; and the pianoforte , with every proper discrimination , was pronounced to be altogether of the highest promise ."
austen#""" Whoever Colonel Campbell might employ ,"" said Frank Churchill , with a smile at Emma , "" the person has not chosen ill . I heard a good deal of Colonel Campbell ' s taste at Weymouth ; and the softness of the upper notes I am sure is exactly what he and _all_ _that_ _party_ would particularly prize . I dare say , Miss Fairfax , that he either gave his friend very minute directions , or wrote to Broadwood himself . Do not you think so ?"" Jane did not look round . She was not obliged to hear ."
austen#"Mrs . Weston had been speaking to her at the same moment . "" It is not fair ,"" said Emma , in a whisper ; "" mine was a random guess . Do not distress her ."" He shook his head with a smile , and looked as if he had very little doubt and very little mercy . Soon afterwards he began again , "" How much your friends in Ireland must be enjoying your pleasure on this occasion , Miss Fairfax ."
austen#"I dare say they often think of you , and wonder which will be the day , the precise day of the instrument ' s coming to hand . Do you imagine Colonel Campbell knows the business to be going forward just at this time ?-- Do you imagine it to be the consequence of an immediate commission from him , or that he may have sent only a general direction , an order indefinite as to time , to depend upon contingencies and conveniences ?"" He paused . She could not but hear ; she could not avoid answering , "" Till I have a letter from Colonel Campbell ,"" said she , in a voice of forced calmness , "" I can imagine nothing with any confidence . It must be all conjecture ."""
austen#""" Conjecture -- aye , sometimes one conjectures right , and sometimes one conjectures wrong . I wish I could conjecture how soon I shall make this rivet quite firm . What nonsense one talks , Miss Woodhouse , when hard at work , if one talks at all ;-- your real workmen , I suppose , hold their tongues ; but we gentlemen labourers if we get hold of a word -- Miss Fairfax said something about conjecturing . There , it is done . I have the pleasure , madam , ( to Mrs . Bates ,) of restoring your spectacles , healed for the present ."" He was very warmly thanked both by mother and daughter ; to escape a little from the latter , he went to the pianoforte , and begged Miss Fairfax , who was still sitting at it , to play something more ."
austen#""" If you are very kind ,"" said he , "" it will be one of the waltzes we danced last night ;-- let me live them over again . You did not enjoy them as I did ; you appeared tired the whole time . I believe you were glad we danced no longer ; but I would have given worlds -- all the worlds one ever has to give -- for another half - hour ."" She played . "" What felicity it is to hear a tune again which _has_ made one happy !-- If I mistake not that was danced at Weymouth ."" She looked up at him for a moment , coloured deeply , and played something else ."
austen#"He took some music from a chair near the pianoforte , and turning to Emma , said , "" Here is something quite new to me . Do you know it ?-- Cramer .-- And here are a new set of Irish melodies . That , from such a quarter , one might expect . This was all sent with the instrument . Very thoughtful of Colonel Campbell , was not it ?-- He knew Miss Fairfax could have no music here ."
austen#"I honour that part of the attention particularly ; it shews it to have been so thoroughly from the heart . Nothing hastily done ; nothing incomplete . True affection only could have prompted it ."" Emma wished he would be less pointed , yet could not help being amused ; and when on glancing her eye towards Jane Fairfax she caught the remains of a smile , when she saw that with all the deep blush of consciousness , there had been a smile of secret delight , she had less scruple in the amusement , and much less compunction with respect to her .-- This amiable , upright , perfect Jane Fairfax was apparently cherishing very reprehensible feelings . He brought all the music to her , and they looked it over together .-- Emma took the opportunity of whispering , "" You speak too plain ."
austen#"She must understand you ."" "" I hope she does . I would have her understand me . I am not in the least ashamed of my meaning ."" "" But really , I am half ashamed , and wish I had never taken up the idea ."" "" I am very glad you did , and that you communicated it to me ."
austen#"I have now a key to all her odd looks and ways . Leave shame to her . If she does wrong , she ought to feel it ."" "" She is not entirely without it , I think ."" "" I do not see much sign of it . She is playing _Robin_ _Adair_ at this moment -- _his_ favourite ."""
austen#"Shortly afterwards Miss Bates , passing near the window , descried Mr . Knightley on horse - back not far off . "" Mr . Knightley I declare !-- I must speak to him if possible , just to thank him . I will not open the window here ; it would give you all cold ; but I can go into my mother ' s room you know . I dare say he will come in when he knows who is here . Quite delightful to have you all meet so !-- Our little room so honoured !"" She was in the adjoining chamber while she still spoke , and opening the casement there , immediately called Mr . Knightley ' s attention , and every syllable of their conversation was as distinctly heard by the others , as if it had passed within the same apartment ."
austen#""" How d ' ye do ?-- how d ' ye do ?-- Very well , I thank you . So obliged to you for the carriage last night . We were just in time ; my mother just ready for us . Pray come in ; do come in . You will find some friends here ."" So began Miss Bates ; and Mr . Knightley seemed determined to be heard in his turn , for most resolutely and commandingly did he say ,"
austen#""" How is your niece , Miss Bates ?-- I want to inquire after you all , but particularly your niece . How is Miss Fairfax ?-- I hope she caught no cold last night . How is she to - day ? Tell me how Miss Fairfax is ."" And Miss Bates was obliged to give a direct answer before he would hear her in any thing else . The listeners were amused ; and Mrs . Weston gave Emma a look of particular meaning ."
austen#"But Emma still shook her head in steady scepticism . "" So obliged to you !-- so very much obliged to you for the carriage ,"" resumed Miss Bates . He cut her short with , "" I am going to Kingston . Can I do any thing for you ?"" "" Oh !"
austen#"dear , Kingston -- are you ?-- Mrs . Cole was saying the other day she wanted something from Kingston ."" "" Mrs . Cole has servants to send . Can I do any thing for _you_ ?"" "" No , I thank you . But do come in ."
austen#"Who do you think is here ?-- Miss Woodhouse and Miss Smith ; so kind as to call to hear the new pianoforte . Do put up your horse at the Crown , and come in ."" "" Well ,"" said he , in a deliberating manner , "" for five minutes , perhaps ."" "" And here is Mrs . Weston and Mr . Frank Churchill too !-- Quite delightful ; so many friends !"" "" No , not now , I thank you . I could not stay two minutes ."
austen#"I must get on to Kingston as fast as I can ."" "" Oh ! do come in . They will be so very happy to see you ."" "" No , no ; your room is full enough . I will call another day , and hear the pianoforte ."""
austen#""" Well , I am so sorry !-- Oh ! Mr . Knightley , what a delightful party last night ; how extremely pleasant .-- Did you ever see such dancing ?-- Was not it delightful ?-- Miss Woodhouse and Mr . Frank Churchill ; I never saw any thing equal to it ."" "" Oh ! very delightful indeed ; I can say nothing less , for I suppose Miss Woodhouse and Mr . Frank Churchill are hearing every thing that passes . And ( raising his voice still more ) I do not see why Miss Fairfax should not be mentioned too . I think Miss Fairfax dances very well ; and Mrs . Weston is the very best country - dance player , without exception , in England ."
austen#"Now , if your friends have any gratitude , they will say something pretty loud about you and me in return ; but I cannot stay to hear it ."" "" Oh ! Mr . Knightley , one moment more ; something of consequence -- so shocked !-- Jane and I are both so shocked about the apples !"" "" What is the matter now ?"" "" To think of your sending us all your store apples . You said you had a great many , and now you have not one left ."
austen#We really are so shocked ! Mrs . Hodges may well be angry . William Larkins mentioned it here . You should not have done it , indeed you should not . Ah ! he is off .
austen#He never can bear to be thanked . But I thought he would have staid now , and it would have been a pity not to have mentioned . . . . Well , ( returning to the room ,) I have not been able to succeed .
austen#"Mr . Knightley cannot stop . He is going to Kingston . He asked me if he could do any thing . . . ."""
austen#""" Yes ,"" said Jane , "" we heard his kind offers , we heard every thing ."" "" Oh ! yes , my dear , I dare say you might , because you know , the door was open , and the window was open , and Mr . Knightley spoke loud . You must have heard every thing to be sure . ` Can I do any thing for you at Kingston ?' said he ; so I just mentioned ."
austen#". . . Oh ! Miss Woodhouse , must you be going ?-- You seem but just come -- so very obliging of you ."" Emma found it really time to be at home ; the visit had already lasted long ; and on examining watches , so much of the morning was perceived to be gone , that Mrs . Weston and her companion taking leave also , could allow themselves only to walk with the two young ladies to Hartfield gates , before they set off for Randalls ."
austen#CHAPTER XI It may be possible to do without dancing entirely . Instances have been known of young people passing many , many months successively , without being at any ball of any description , and no material injury accrue either to body or mind ;-- but when a beginning is made -- when the felicities of rapid motion have once been , though slightly , felt -- it must be a very heavy set that does not ask for more . Frank Churchill had danced once at Highbury , and longed to dance again ; and the last half - hour of an evening which Mr . Woodhouse was persuaded to spend with his daughter at Randalls , was passed by the two young people in schemes on the subject . Frank ' s was the first idea ; and his the greatest zeal in pursuing it ; for the lady was the best judge of the difficulties , and the most solicitous for accommodation and appearance . But still she had inclination enough for shewing people again how delightfully Mr . Frank Churchill and Miss Woodhouse danced -- for doing that in which she need not blush to compare herself with Jane Fairfax -- and even for simple dancing itself , without any of the wicked aids of vanity -- to assist him first in pacing out the room they were in to see what it could be made to hold -- and then in taking the dimensions of the other parlour , in the hope of discovering , in spite of all that Mr . Weston could say of their exactly equal size , that it was a little the largest .
austen#"His first proposition and request , that the dance begun at Mr . Cole ' s should be finished there -- that the same party should be collected , and the same musician engaged , met with the readiest acquiescence . Mr . Weston entered into the idea with thorough enjoyment , and Mrs . Weston most willingly undertook to play as long as they could wish to dance ; and the interesting employment had followed , of reckoning up exactly who there would be , and portioning out the indispensable division of space to every couple . "" You and Miss Smith , and Miss Fairfax , will be three , and the two Miss Coxes five ,"" had been repeated many times over . "" And there will be the two Gilberts , young Cox , my father , and myself , besides Mr . Knightley . Yes , that will be quite enough for pleasure . You and Miss Smith , and Miss Fairfax , will be three , and the two Miss Coxes five ; and for five couple there will be plenty of room ."""
austen#"But soon it came to be on one side , "" But will there be good room for five couple ?-- I really do not think there will ."" On another , "" And after all , five couple are not enough to make it worth while to stand up . Five couple are nothing , when one thinks seriously about it . It will not do to _invite_ five couple ."
austen#"It can be allowable only as the thought of the moment ."" Somebody said that _Miss_ Gilbert was expected at her brother ' s , and must be invited with the rest . Somebody else believed _Mrs_ . Gilbert would have danced the other evening , if she had been asked . A word was put in for a second young Cox ; and at last , Mr . Weston naming one family of cousins who must be included , and another of very old acquaintance who could not be left out , it became a certainty that the five couple would be at least ten , and a very interesting speculation in what possible manner they could be disposed of . The doors of the two rooms were just opposite each other ."
austen#""" Might not they use both rooms , and dance across the passage ?"" It seemed the best scheme ; and yet it was not so good but that many of them wanted a better . Emma said it would be awkward ; Mrs . Weston was in distress about the supper ; and Mr . Woodhouse opposed it earnestly , on the score of health . It made him so very unhappy , indeed , that it could not be persevered in . "" Oh ! no ,"" said he ; "" it would be the extreme of imprudence ."
austen#I could not bear it for Emma !-- Emma is not strong . She would catch a dreadful cold . So would poor little Harriet . So you would all . Mrs . Weston , you would be quite laid up ; do not let them talk of such a wild thing . Pray do not let them talk of it .
austen#"That young man ( speaking lower ) is very thoughtless . Do not tell his father , but that young man is not quite the thing . He has been opening the doors very often this evening , and keeping them open very inconsiderately . He does not think of the draught . I do not mean to set you against him , but indeed he is not quite the thing !"" Mrs . Weston was sorry for such a charge ."
austen#"She knew the importance of it , and said every thing in her power to do it away . Every door was now closed , the passage plan given up , and the first scheme of dancing only in the room they were in resorted to again ; and with such good - will on Frank Churchill ' s part , that the space which a quarter of an hour before had been deemed barely sufficient for five couple , was now endeavoured to be made out quite enough for ten . "" We were too magnificent ,"" said he . "" We allowed unnecessary room . Ten couple may stand here very well ."" Emma demurred ."
austen#""" It would be a crowd -- a sad crowd ; and what could be worse than dancing without space to turn in ?"" "" Very true ,"" he gravely replied ; "" it was very bad ."" But still he went on measuring , and still he ended with , "" I think there will be very tolerable room for ten couple ."" "" No , no ,"" said she , "" you are quite unreasonable . It would be dreadful to be standing so close !"
austen#"Nothing can be farther from pleasure than to be dancing in a crowd -- and a crowd in a little room !"" "" There is no denying it ,"" he replied . "" I agree with you exactly . A crowd in a little room -- Miss Woodhouse , you have the art of giving pictures in a few words . Exquisite , quite exquisite !-- Still , however , having proceeded so far , one is unwilling to give the matter up . It would be a disappointment to my father -- and altogether -- I do not know that -- I am rather of opinion that ten couple might stand here very well ."""
austen#"Emma perceived that the nature of his gallantry was a little self - willed , and that he would rather oppose than lose the pleasure of dancing with her ; but she took the compliment , and forgave the rest . Had she intended ever to _marry_ him , it might have been worth while to pause and consider , and try to understand the value of his preference , and the character of his temper ; but for all the purposes of their acquaintance , he was quite amiable enough . Before the middle of the next day , he was at Hartfield ; and he entered the room with such an agreeable smile as certified the continuance of the scheme . It soon appeared that he came to announce an improvement . "" Well , Miss Woodhouse ,"" he almost immediately began , "" your inclination for dancing has not been quite frightened away , I hope , by the terrors of my father ' s little rooms . I bring a new proposal on the subject :-- a thought of my father ' s , which waits only your approbation to be acted upon ."
austen#"May I hope for the honour of your hand for the two first dances of this little projected ball , to be given , not at Randalls , but at the Crown Inn ?"" "" The Crown !"" "" Yes ; if you and Mr . Woodhouse see no objection , and I trust you cannot , my father hopes his friends will be so kind as to visit him there . Better accommodations , he can promise them , and not a less grateful welcome than at Randalls . It is his own idea . Mrs . Weston sees no objection to it , provided you are satisfied ."
austen#"This is what we all feel . Oh ! you were perfectly right ! Ten couple , in either of the Randalls rooms , would have been insufferable !-- Dreadful !-- I felt how right you were the whole time , but was too anxious for securing _any_ _thing_ to like to yield . Is not it a good exchange ?-- You consent -- I hope you consent ?"" "" It appears to me a plan that nobody can object to , if Mr . and Mrs . Weston do not ."
austen#"I think it admirable ; and , as far as I can answer for myself , shall be most happy -- It seems the only improvement that could be . Papa , do you not think it an excellent improvement ?"" She was obliged to repeat and explain it , before it was fully comprehended ; and then , being quite new , farther representations were necessary to make it acceptable . "" No ; he thought it very far from an improvement -- a very bad plan -- much worse than the other . A room at an inn was always damp and dangerous ; never properly aired , or fit to be inhabited . If they must dance , they had better dance at Randalls ."
austen#"He had never been in the room at the Crown in his life -- did not know the people who kept it by sight .-- Oh ! no -- a very bad plan . They would catch worse colds at the Crown than anywhere ."" "" I was going to observe , sir ,"" said Frank Churchill , "" that one of the great recommendations of this change would be the very little danger of any body ' s catching cold -- so much less danger at the Crown than at Randalls ! Mr . Perry might have reason to regret the alteration , but nobody else could ."" "" Sir ,"" said Mr . Woodhouse , rather warmly , "" you are very much mistaken if you suppose Mr . Perry to be that sort of character ."
austen#"Mr . Perry is extremely concerned when any of us are ill . But I do not understand how the room at the Crown can be safer for you than your father ' s house ."" "" From the very circumstance of its being larger , sir . We shall have no occasion to open the windows at all -- not once the whole evening ; and it is that dreadful habit of opening the windows , letting in cold air upon heated bodies , which ( as you well know , sir ) does the mischief ."" "" Open the windows !-- but surely , Mr . Churchill , nobody would think of opening the windows at Randalls . Nobody could be so imprudent !"
austen#"I never heard of such a thing . Dancing with open windows !-- I am sure , neither your father nor Mrs . Weston ( poor Miss Taylor that was ) would suffer it ."" "" Ah ! sir -- but a thoughtless young person will sometimes step behind a window - curtain , and throw up a sash , without its being suspected . I have often known it done myself ."" "" Have you indeed , sir ?-- Bless me !"
austen#"I never could have supposed it . But I live out of the world , and am often astonished at what I hear . However , this does make a difference ; and , perhaps , when we come to talk it over -- but these sort of things require a good deal of consideration . One cannot resolve upon them in a hurry . If Mr . and Mrs . Weston will be so obliging as to call here one morning , we may talk it over , and see what can be done ."" "" But , unfortunately , sir , my time is so limited --"""
austen#""" Oh !"" interrupted Emma , "" there will be plenty of time for talking every thing over . There is no hurry at all . If it can be contrived to be at the Crown , papa , it will be very convenient for the horses . They will be so near their own stable ."" "" So they will , my dear ."
austen#"That is a great thing . Not that James ever complains ; but it is right to spare our horses when we can . If I could be sure of the rooms being thoroughly aired -- but is Mrs . Stokes to be trusted ? I doubt it . I do not know her , even by sight ."" "" I can answer for every thing of that nature , sir , because it will be under Mrs . Weston ' s care ."
austen#"Mrs . Weston undertakes to direct the whole ."" "" There , papa !-- Now you must be satisfied -- Our own dear Mrs . Weston , who is carefulness itself . Do not you remember what Mr . Perry said , so many years ago , when I had the measles ? ` If _Miss_ _Taylor_ undertakes to wrap Miss Emma up , you need not have any fears , sir .' How often have I heard you speak of it as such a compliment to her !"" "" Aye , very true ."
austen#Mr . Perry did say so . I shall never forget it . Poor little Emma ! You were very bad with the measles ; that is , you would have been very bad , but for Perry ' s great attention . He came four times a day for a week . He said , from the first , it was a very good sort -- which was our great comfort ; but the measles are a dreadful complaint .
austen#"I hope whenever poor Isabella ' s little ones have the measles , she will send for Perry ."" "" My father and Mrs . Weston are at the Crown at this moment ,"" said Frank Churchill , "" examining the capabilities of the house . I left them there and came on to Hartfield , impatient for your opinion , and hoping you might be persuaded to join them and give your advice on the spot . I was desired to say so from both . It would be the greatest pleasure to them , if you could allow me to attend you there . They can do nothing satisfactorily without you ."""
austen#"Emma was most happy to be called to such a council ; and her father , engaging to think it all over while she was gone , the two young people set off together without delay for the Crown . There were Mr . and Mrs . Weston ; delighted to see her and receive her approbation , very busy and very happy in their different way ; she , in some little distress ; and he , finding every thing perfect . "" Emma ,"" said she , "" this paper is worse than I expected . Look ! in places you see it is dreadfully dirty ; and the wainscot is more yellow and forlorn than any thing I could have imagined ."" "" My dear , you are too particular ,"" said her husband ."
austen#""" What does all that signify ? You will see nothing of it by candlelight . It will be as clean as Randalls by candlelight . We never see any thing of it on our club - nights ."" The ladies here probably exchanged looks which meant , "" Men never know when things are dirty or not ;"" and the gentlemen perhaps thought each to himself , "" Women will have their little nonsenses and needless cares ."" One perplexity , however , arose , which the gentlemen did not disdain ."
austen#It regarded a supper - room . At the time of the ballroom ' s being built , suppers had not been in question ; and a small card - room adjoining , was the only addition . What was to be done ? This card - room would be wanted as a card - room now ; or , if cards were conveniently voted unnecessary by their four selves , still was it not too small for any comfortable supper ? Another room of much better size might be secured for the purpose ; but it was at the other end of the house , and a long awkward passage must be gone through to get at it . This made a difficulty .
austen#"Mrs . Weston was afraid of draughts for the young people in that passage ; and neither Emma nor the gentlemen could tolerate the prospect of being miserably crowded at supper . Mrs . Weston proposed having no regular supper ; merely sandwiches , & c ., set out in the little room ; but that was scouted as a wretched suggestion . A private dance , without sitting down to supper , was pronounced an infamous fraud upon the rights of men and women ; and Mrs . Weston must not speak of it again . She then took another line of expediency , and looking into the doubtful room , observed , "" I do not think it _is_ so very small . We shall not be many , you know ."""
austen#"And Mr . Weston at the same time , walking briskly with long steps through the passage , was calling out , "" You talk a great deal of the length of this passage , my dear . It is a mere nothing after all ; and not the least draught from the stairs ."" "" I wish ,"" said Mrs . Weston , "" one could know which arrangement our guests in general would like best . To do what would be most generally pleasing must be our object -- if one could but tell what that would be ."" "" Yes , very true ,"" cried Frank , "" very true ."
austen#You want your neighbours ' opinions . I do not wonder at you . If one could ascertain what the chief of them -- the Coles , for instance . They are not far off . Shall I call upon them ? Or Miss Bates ?
austen#"She is still nearer .-- And I do not know whether Miss Bates is not as likely to understand the inclinations of the rest of the people as any body . I think we do want a larger council . Suppose I go and invite Miss Bates to join us ?"" "" Well -- if you please ,"" said Mrs . Weston rather hesitating , "" if you think she will be of any use ."" "" You will get nothing to the purpose from Miss Bates ,"" said Emma . "" She will be all delight and gratitude , but she will tell you nothing ."
austen#"She will not even listen to your questions . I see no advantage in consulting Miss Bates ."" "" But she is so amusing , so extremely amusing ! I am very fond of hearing Miss Bates talk . And I need not bring the whole family , you know ."" Here Mr . Weston joined them , and on hearing what was proposed , gave it his decided approbation ."
austen#""" Aye , do , Frank .-- Go and fetch Miss Bates , and let us end the matter at once . She will enjoy the scheme , I am sure ; and I do not know a properer person for shewing us how to do away difficulties . Fetch Miss Bates . We are growing a little too nice . She is a standing lesson of how to be happy . But fetch them both ."
austen#"Invite them both ."" "" Both sir ! Can the old lady ?"" . . ."
austen#""" The old lady ! No , the young lady , to be sure . I shall think you a great blockhead , Frank , if you bring the aunt without the niece ."" "" Oh ! I beg your pardon , sir . I did not immediately recollect ."
austen#"Undoubtedly if you wish it , I will endeavour to persuade them both ."" And away he ran . Long before he reappeared , attending the short , neat , brisk - moving aunt , and her elegant niece ,-- Mrs . Weston , like a sweet - tempered woman and a good wife , had examined the passage again , and found the evils of it much less than she had supposed before -- indeed very trifling ; and here ended the difficulties of decision . All the rest , in speculation at least , was perfectly smooth . All the minor arrangements of table and chair , lights and music , tea and supper , made themselves ; or were left as mere trifles to be settled at any time between Mrs . Weston and Mrs . Stokes .-- Every body invited , was certainly to come ; Frank had already written to Enscombe to propose staying a few days beyond his fortnight , which could not possibly be refused ."
austen#"And a delightful dance it was to be . Most cordially , when Miss Bates arrived , did she agree that it must . As a counsellor she was not wanted ; but as an approver , ( a much safer character ,) she was truly welcome . Her approbation , at once general and minute , warm and incessant , could not but please ; and for another half - hour they were all walking to and fro , between the different rooms , some suggesting , some attending , and all in happy enjoyment of the future . The party did not break up without Emma ' s being positively secured for the two first dances by the hero of the evening , nor without her overhearing Mr . Weston whisper to his wife , "" He has asked her , my dear . That ' s right ."
austen#"I knew he would !"" CHAPTER XII One thing only was wanting to make the prospect of the ball completely satisfactory to Emma -- its being fixed for a day within the granted term of Frank Churchill ' s stay in Surry ; for , in spite of Mr . Weston ' s confidence , she could not think it so very impossible that the Churchills might not allow their nephew to remain a day beyond his fortnight . But this was not judged feasible . The preparations must take their time , nothing could be properly ready till the third week were entered on , and for a few days they must be planning , proceeding and hoping in uncertainty -- at the risk -- in her opinion , the great risk , of its being all in vain . Enscombe however was gracious , gracious in fact , if not in word ."
austen#"His wish of staying longer evidently did not please ; but it was not opposed . All was safe and prosperous ; and as the removal of one solicitude generally makes way for another , Emma , being now certain of her ball , began to adopt as the next vexation Mr . Knightley ' s provoking indifference about it . Either because he did not dance himself , or because the plan had been formed without his being consulted , he seemed resolved that it should not interest him , determined against its exciting any present curiosity , or affording him any future amusement . To her voluntary communications Emma could get no more approving reply , than , "" Very well . If the Westons think it worth while to be at all this trouble for a few hours of noisy entertainment , I have nothing to say against it , but that they shall not chuse pleasures for me .-- Oh !"
austen#"yes , I must be there ; I could not refuse ; and I will keep as much awake as I can ; but I would rather be at home , looking over William Larkins ' s week ' s account ; much rather , I confess .-- Pleasure in seeing dancing !-- not I , indeed -- I never look at it -- I do not know who does .-- Fine dancing , I believe , like virtue , must be its own reward . Those who are standing by are usually thinking of something very different ."" This Emma felt was aimed at her ; and it made her quite angry . It was not in compliment to Jane Fairfax however that he was so indifferent , or so indignant ; he was not guided by _her_ feelings in reprobating the ball , for _she_ enjoyed the thought of it to an extraordinary degree . It made her animated -- open hearted -- she voluntarily said ;-- "" Oh !"
austen#"Miss Woodhouse , I hope nothing may happen to prevent the ball . What a disappointment it would be ! I do look forward to it , I own , with _very_ great pleasure ."" It was not to oblige Jane Fairfax therefore that he would have preferred the society of William Larkins . No !-- she was more and more convinced that Mrs . Weston was quite mistaken in that surmise . There was a great deal of friendly and of compassionate attachment on his side -- but no love ."
austen#Alas ! there was soon no leisure for quarrelling with Mr . Knightley . Two days of joyful security were immediately followed by the over - throw of every thing . A letter arrived from Mr . Churchill to urge his nephew ' s instant return . Mrs . Churchill was unwell -- far too unwell to do without him ; she had been in a very suffering state ( so said her husband ) when writing to her nephew two days before , though from her usual unwillingness to give pain , and constant habit of never thinking of herself , she had not mentioned it ; but now she was too ill to trifle , and must entreat him to set off for Enscombe without delay . The substance of this letter was forwarded to Emma , in a note from Mrs . Weston , instantly .
austen#"As to his going , it was inevitable . He must be gone within a few hours , though without feeling any real alarm for his aunt , to lessen his repugnance . He knew her illnesses ; they never occurred but for her own convenience . Mrs . Weston added , "" that he could only allow himself time to hurry to Highbury , after breakfast , and take leave of the few friends there whom he could suppose to feel any interest in him ; and that he might be expected at Hartfield very soon ."" This wretched note was the finale of Emma ' s breakfast . When once it had been read , there was no doing any thing , but lament and exclaim ."
austen#"The loss of the ball -- the loss of the young man -- and all that the young man might be feeling !-- It was too wretched !-- Such a delightful evening as it would have been !-- Every body so happy ! and she and her partner the happiest !--"" I said it would be so ,"" was the only consolation . Her father ' s feelings were quite distinct . He thought principally of Mrs . Churchill ' s illness , and wanted to know how she was treated ; and as for the ball , it was shocking to have dear Emma disappointed ; but they would all be safer at home . Emma was ready for her visitor some time before he appeared ; but if this reflected at all upon his impatience , his sorrowful look and total want of spirits when he did come might redeem him . He felt the going away almost too much to speak of it ."
austen#"His dejection was most evident . He sat really lost in thought for the first few minutes ; and when rousing himself , it was only to say , "" Of all horrid things , leave - taking is the worst ."" "" But you will come again ,"" said Emma . "" This will not be your only visit to Randalls ."" "" Ah !--( shaking his head )-- the uncertainty of when I may be able to return !-- I shall try for it with a zeal !-- It will be the object of all my thoughts and cares !-- and if my uncle and aunt go to town this spring -- but I am afraid -- they did not stir last spring -- I am afraid it is a custom gone for ever ."""
austen#""" Our poor ball must be quite given up ."" "" Ah ! that ball !-- why did we wait for any thing ?-- why not seize the pleasure at once ?-- How often is happiness destroyed by preparation , foolish preparation !-- You told us it would be so .-- Oh ! Miss Woodhouse , why are you always so right ?"" "" Indeed , I am very sorry to be right in this instance . I would much rather have been merry than wise ."""
austen#""" If I can come again , we are still to have our ball . My father depends on it . Do not forget your engagement ."" Emma looked graciously . "" Such a fortnight as it has been !"" he continued ; "" every day more precious and more delightful than the day before !-- every day making me less fit to bear any other place ."
austen#"Happy those , who can remain at Highbury !"" "" As you do us such ample justice now ,"" said Emma , laughing , "" I will venture to ask , whether you did not come a little doubtfully at first ? Do not we rather surpass your expectations ? I am sure we do . I am sure you did not much expect to like us . You would not have been so long in coming , if you had had a pleasant idea of Highbury ."""
austen#"He laughed rather consciously ; and though denying the sentiment , Emma was convinced that it had been so . "" And you must be off this very morning ?"" "" Yes ; my father is to join me here : we shall walk back together , and I must be off immediately . I am almost afraid that every moment will bring him ."" "" Not five minutes to spare even for your friends Miss Fairfax and Miss Bates ? How unlucky !"
austen#"Miss Bates ' s powerful , argumentative mind might have strengthened yours ."" "" Yes -- I _have_ called there ; passing the door , I thought it better . It was a right thing to do . I went in for three minutes , and was detained by Miss Bates ' s being absent . She was out ; and I felt it impossible not to wait till she came in . She is a woman that one may , that one _must_ laugh at ; but that one would not wish to slight ."
austen#"It was better to pay my visit , then ""-- He hesitated , got up , walked to a window . "" In short ,"" said he , "" perhaps , Miss Woodhouse -- I think you can hardly be quite without suspicion ""-- He looked at her , as if wanting to read her thoughts . She hardly knew what to say . It seemed like the forerunner of something absolutely serious , which she did not wish ."
austen#"Forcing herself to speak , therefore , in the hope of putting it by , she calmly said , "" You are quite in the right ; it was most natural to pay your visit , then ""-- He was silent . She believed he was looking at her ; probably reflecting on what she had said , and trying to understand the manner . She heard him sigh . It was natural for him to feel that he had _cause_ to sigh ."
austen#"He could not believe her to be encouraging him . A few awkward moments passed , and he sat down again ; and in a more determined manner said , "" It was something to feel that all the rest of my time might be given to Hartfield . My regard for Hartfield is most warm ""-- He stopt again , rose again , and seemed quite embarrassed .-- He was more in love with her than Emma had supposed ; and who can say how it might have ended , if his father had not made his appearance ? Mr . Woodhouse soon followed ; and the necessity of exertion made him composed ."
austen#"A very few minutes more , however , completed the present trial . Mr . Weston , always alert when business was to be done , and as incapable of procrastinating any evil that was inevitable , as of foreseeing any that was doubtful , said , "" It was time to go ;"" and the young man , though he might and did sigh , could not but agree , to take leave . "" I shall hear about you all ,"" said he ; "" that is my chief consolation . I shall hear of every thing that is going on among you . I have engaged Mrs . Weston to correspond with me . She has been so kind as to promise it ."
austen#"Oh ! the blessing of a female correspondent , when one is really interested in the absent !-- she will tell me every thing . In her letters I shall be at dear Highbury again ."" A very friendly shake of the hand , a very earnest "" Good - bye ,"" closed the speech , and the door had soon shut out Frank Churchill . Short had been the notice -- short their meeting ; he was gone ; and Emma felt so sorry to part , and foresaw so great a loss to their little society from his absence as to begin to be afraid of being too sorry , and feeling it too much . It was a sad change ."
austen#"They had been meeting almost every day since his arrival . Certainly his being at Randalls had given great spirit to the last two weeks -- indescribable spirit ; the idea , the expectation of seeing him which every morning had brought , the assurance of his attentions , his liveliness , his manners ! It had been a very happy fortnight , and forlorn must be the sinking from it into the common course of Hartfield days . To complete every other recommendation , he had _almost_ told her that he loved her . What strength , or what constancy of affection he might be subject to , was another point ; but at present she could not doubt his having a decidedly warm admiration , a conscious preference of herself ; and this persuasion , joined to all the rest , made her think that she _must_ be a little in love with him , in spite of every previous determination against it . "" I certainly must ,"" said she ."
austen#""" This sensation of listlessness , weariness , stupidity , this disinclination to sit down and employ myself , this feeling of every thing ' s being dull and insipid about the house !-- I must be in love ; I should be the oddest creature in the world if I were not -- for a few weeks at least . Well ! evil to some is always good to others . I shall have many fellow - mourners for the ball , if not for Frank Churchill ; but Mr . Knightley will be happy . He may spend the evening with his dear William Larkins now if he likes ."" Mr . Knightley , however , shewed no triumphant happiness ."
austen#"He could not say that he was sorry on his own account ; his very cheerful look would have contradicted him if he had ; but he said , and very steadily , that he was sorry for the disappointment of the others , and with considerable kindness added , "" You , Emma , who have so few opportunities of dancing , you are really out of luck ; you are very much out of luck !"" It was some days before she saw Jane Fairfax , to judge of her honest regret in this woeful change ; but when they did meet , her composure was odious . She had been particularly unwell , however , suffering from headache to a degree , which made her aunt declare , that had the ball taken place , she did not think Jane could have attended it ; and it was charity to impute some of her unbecoming indifference to the languor of ill - health . CHAPTER XIII Emma continued to entertain no doubt of her being in love ."
austen#Her ideas only varied as to the how much . At first , she thought it was a good deal ; and afterwards , but little . She had great pleasure in hearing Frank Churchill talked of ; and , for his sake , greater pleasure than ever in seeing Mr . and Mrs . Weston ; she was very often thinking of him , and quite impatient for a letter , that she might know how he was , how were his spirits , how was his aunt , and what was the chance of his coming to Randalls again this spring . But , on the other hand , she could not admit herself to be unhappy , nor , after the first morning , to be less disposed for employment than usual ; she was still busy and cheerful ; and , pleasing as he was , she could yet imagine him to have faults ; and farther , though thinking of him so much , and , as she sat drawing or working , forming a thousand amusing schemes for the progress and close of their attachment , fancying interesting dialogues , and inventing elegant letters ; the conclusion of every imaginary declaration on his side was that she _refused_ _him_ . Their affection was always to subside into friendship . Every thing tender and charming was to mark their parting ; but still they were to part .
austen#"When she became sensible of this , it struck her that she could not be very much in love ; for in spite of her previous and fixed determination never to quit her father , never to marry , a strong attachment certainly must produce more of a struggle than she could foresee in her own feelings . "" I do not find myself making any use of the word _sacrifice_ ,"" said she .-- "" In not one of all my clever replies , my delicate negatives , is there any allusion to making a sacrifice . I do suspect that he is not really necessary to my happiness . So much the better . I certainly will not persuade myself to feel more than I do . I am quite enough in love ."
austen#"I should be sorry to be more ."" Upon the whole , she was equally contented with her view of his feelings . "" _He_ is undoubtedly very much in love -- every thing denotes it -- very much in love indeed !-- and when he comes again , if his affection continue , I must be on my guard not to encourage it .-- It would be most inexcusable to do otherwise , as my own mind is quite made up . Not that I imagine he can think I have been encouraging him hitherto . No , if he had believed me at all to share his feelings , he would not have been so wretched . Could he have thought himself encouraged , his looks and language at parting would have been different .-- Still , however , I must be on my guard ."
austen#"This is in the supposition of his attachment continuing what it now is ; but I do not know that I expect it will ; I do not look upon him to be quite the sort of man -- I do not altogether build upon his steadiness or constancy .-- His feelings are warm , but I can imagine them rather changeable .-- Every consideration of the subject , in short , makes me thankful that my happiness is not more deeply involved .-- I shall do very well again after a little while -- and then , it will be a good thing over ; for they say every body is in love once in their lives , and I shall have been let off easily ."" When his letter to Mrs . Weston arrived , Emma had the perusal of it ; and she read it with a degree of pleasure and admiration which made her at first shake her head over her own sensations , and think she had undervalued their strength . It was a long , well - written letter , giving the particulars of his journey and of his feelings , expressing all the affection , gratitude , and respect which was natural and honourable , and describing every thing exterior and local that could be supposed attractive , with spirit and precision . No suspicious flourishes now of apology or concern ; it was the language of real feeling towards Mrs . Weston ; and the transition from Highbury to Enscombe , the contrast between the places in some of the first blessings of social life was just enough touched on to shew how keenly it was felt , and how much more might have been said but for the restraints of propriety .-- The charm of her own name was not wanting . _Miss_ _Woodhouse_ appeared more than once , and never without a something of pleasing connexion , either a compliment to her taste , or a remembrance of what she had said ; and in the very last time of its meeting her eye , unadorned as it was by any such broad wreath of gallantry , she yet could discern the effect of her influence and acknowledge the greatest compliment perhaps of all conveyed . Compressed into the very lowest vacant corner were these words --"" I had not a spare moment on Tuesday , as you know , for Miss Woodhouse ' s beautiful little friend ."
austen#"Pray make my excuses and adieus to her ."" This , Emma could not doubt , was all for herself . Harriet was remembered only from being _her_ friend . His information and prospects as to Enscombe were neither worse nor better than had been anticipated ; Mrs . Churchill was recovering , and he dared not yet , even in his own imagination , fix a time for coming to Randalls again . Gratifying , however , and stimulative as was the letter in the material part , its sentiments , she yet found , when it was folded up and returned to Mrs . Weston , that it had not added any lasting warmth , that she could still do without the writer , and that he must learn to do without her . Her intentions were unchanged ."
austen#"Her resolution of refusal only grew more interesting by the addition of a scheme for his subsequent consolation and happiness . His recollection of Harriet , and the words which clothed it , the "" beautiful little friend ,"" suggested to her the idea of Harriet ' s succeeding her in his affections . Was it impossible ?-- No .-- Harriet undoubtedly was greatly his inferior in understanding ; but he had been very much struck with the loveliness of her face and the warm simplicity of her manner ; and all the probabilities of circumstance and connexion were in her favour .-- For Harriet , it would be advantageous and delightful indeed . "" I must not dwell upon it ,"" said she .--"" I must not think of it . I know the danger of indulging such speculations . But stranger things have happened ; and when we cease to care for each other as we do now , it will be the means of confirming us in that sort of true disinterested friendship which I can already look forward to with pleasure ."""
austen#"It was well to have a comfort in store on Harriet ' s behalf , though it might be wise to let the fancy touch it seldom ; for evil in that quarter was at hand . As Frank Churchill ' s arrival had succeeded Mr . Elton ' s engagement in the conversation of Highbury , as the latest interest had entirely borne down the first , so now upon Frank Churchill ' s disappearance , Mr . Elton ' s concerns were assuming the most irresistible form .-- His wedding - day was named . He would soon be among them again ; Mr . Elton and his bride . There was hardly time to talk over the first letter from Enscombe before "" Mr . Elton and his bride "" was in every body ' s mouth , and Frank Churchill was forgotten . Emma grew sick at the sound . She had had three weeks of happy exemption from Mr . Elton ; and Harriet ' s mind , she had been willing to hope , had been lately gaining strength ."
austen#"With Mr . Weston ' s ball in view at least , there had been a great deal of insensibility to other things ; but it was now too evident that she had not attained such a state of composure as could stand against the actual approach -- new carriage , bell - ringing , and all . Poor Harriet was in a flutter of spirits which required all the reasonings and soothings and attentions of every kind that Emma could give . Emma felt that she could not do too much for her , that Harriet had a right to all her ingenuity and all her patience ; but it was heavy work to be for ever convincing without producing any effect , for ever agreed to , without being able to make their opinions the same . Harriet listened submissively , and said "" it was very true -- it was just as Miss Woodhouse described -- it was not worth while to think about them -- and she would not think about them any longer "" but no change of subject could avail , and the next half - hour saw her as anxious and restless about the Eltons as before . At last Emma attacked her on another ground . "" Your allowing yourself to be so occupied and so unhappy about Mr . Elton ' s marrying , Harriet , is the strongest reproach you can make _me_ ."
austen#"You could not give me a greater reproof for the mistake I fell into . It was all my doing , I know . I have not forgotten it , I assure you .-- Deceived myself , I did very miserably deceive you -- and it will be a painful reflection to me for ever . Do not imagine me in danger of forgetting it ."" Harriet felt this too much to utter more than a few words of eager exclamation . Emma continued ,"
austen#""" I have not said , exert yourself Harriet for my sake ; think less , talk less of Mr . Elton for my sake ; because for your own sake rather , I would wish it to be done , for the sake of what is more important than my comfort , a habit of self - command in you , a consideration of what is your duty , an attention to propriety , an endeavour to avoid the suspicions of others , to save your health and credit , and restore your tranquillity . These are the motives which I have been pressing on you . They are very important -- and sorry I am that you cannot feel them sufficiently to act upon them . My being saved from pain is a very secondary consideration . I want you to save yourself from greater pain . Perhaps I may sometimes have felt that Harriet would not forget what was due -- or rather what would be kind by me ."""
austen#"This appeal to her affections did more than all the rest . The idea of wanting gratitude and consideration for Miss Woodhouse , whom she really loved extremely , made her wretched for a while , and when the violence of grief was comforted away , still remained powerful enough to prompt to what was right and support her in it very tolerably . "" You , who have been the best friend I ever had in my life -- Want gratitude to you !-- Nobody is equal to you !-- I care for nobody as I do for you !-- Oh ! Miss Woodhouse , how ungrateful I have been !"" Such expressions , assisted as they were by every thing that look and manner could do , made Emma feel that she had never loved Harriet so well , nor valued her affection so highly before . "" There is no charm equal to tenderness of heart ,"" said she afterwards to herself ."
austen#""" There is nothing to be compared to it . Warmth and tenderness of heart , with an affectionate , open manner , will beat all the clearness of head in the world , for attraction , I am sure it will . It is tenderness of heart which makes my dear father so generally beloved -- which gives Isabella all her popularity .-- I have it not -- but I know how to prize and respect it .-- Harriet is my superior in all the charm and all the felicity it gives . Dear Harriet !-- I would not change you for the clearest - headed , longest - sighted , best - judging female breathing . Oh ! the coldness of a Jane Fairfax !-- Harriet is worth a hundred such -- And for a wife -- a sensible man ' s wife -- it is invaluable ."
austen#"I mention no names ; but happy the man who changes Emma for Harriet !"" CHAPTER XIV Mrs . Elton was first seen at church : but though devotion might be interrupted , curiosity could not be satisfied by a bride in a pew , and it must be left for the visits in form which were then to be paid , to settle whether she were very pretty indeed , or only rather pretty , or not pretty at all . Emma had feelings , less of curiosity than of pride or propriety , to make her resolve on not being the last to pay her respects ; and she made a point of Harriet ' s going with her , that the worst of the business might be gone through as soon as possible . She could not enter the house again , could not be in the same room to which she had with such vain artifice retreated three months ago , to lace up her boot , without _recollecting_ . A thousand vexatious thoughts would recur ."
austen#"Compliments , charades , and horrible blunders ; and it was not to be supposed that poor Harriet should not be recollecting too ; but she behaved very well , and was only rather pale and silent . The visit was of course short ; and there was so much embarrassment and occupation of mind to shorten it , that Emma would not allow herself entirely to form an opinion of the lady , and on no account to give one , beyond the nothing - meaning terms of being "" elegantly dressed , and very pleasing ."" She did not really like her . She would not be in a hurry to find fault , but she suspected that there was no elegance ;-- ease , but not elegance .-- She was almost sure that for a young woman , a stranger , a bride , there was too much ease . Her person was rather good ; her face not unpretty ; but neither feature , nor air , nor voice , nor manner , were elegant . Emma thought at least it would turn out so ."
austen#"As for Mr . Elton , his manners did not appear -- but no , she would not permit a hasty or a witty word from herself about his manners . It was an awkward ceremony at any time to be receiving wedding visits , and a man had need be all grace to acquit himself well through it . The woman was better off ; she might have the assistance of fine clothes , and the privilege of bashfulness , but the man had only his own good sense to depend on ; and when she considered how peculiarly unlucky poor Mr . Elton was in being in the same room at once with the woman he had just married , the woman he had wanted to marry , and the woman whom he had been expected to marry , she must allow him to have the right to look as little wise , and to be as much affectedly , and as little really easy as could be . "" Well , Miss Woodhouse ,"" said Harriet , when they had quitted the house , and after waiting in vain for her friend to begin ; "" Well , Miss Woodhouse , ( with a gentle sigh ,) what do you think of her ?-- Is not she very charming ?"" There was a little hesitation in Emma ' s answer . "" Oh !"
austen#"yes -- very -- a very pleasing young woman ."" "" I think her beautiful , quite beautiful ."" "" Very nicely dressed , indeed ; a remarkably elegant gown ."" "" I am not at all surprized that he should have fallen in love ."" "" Oh ! no -- there is nothing to surprize one at all .-- A pretty fortune ; and she came in his way ."""
austen#""" I dare say ,"" returned Harriet , sighing again , "" I dare say she was very much attached to him ."" "" Perhaps she might ; but it is not every man ' s fate to marry the woman who loves him best . Miss Hawkins perhaps wanted a home , and thought this the best offer she was likely to have ."" "" Yes ,"" said Harriet earnestly , "" and well she might , nobody could ever have a better . Well , I wish them happy with all my heart . And now , Miss Woodhouse , I do not think I shall mind seeing them again ."
austen#"He is just as superior as ever ;-- but being married , you know , it is quite a different thing . No , indeed , Miss Woodhouse , you need not be afraid ; I can sit and admire him now without any great misery . To know that he has not thrown himself away , is such a comfort !-- She does seem a charming young woman , just what he deserves . Happy creature ! He called her ` Augusta .' How delightful !"""
austen#When the visit was returned , Emma made up her mind . She could then see more and judge better . From Harriet ' s happening not to be at Hartfield , and her father ' s being present to engage Mr . Elton , she had a quarter of an hour of the lady ' s conversation to herself , and could composedly attend to her ; and the quarter of an hour quite convinced her that Mrs . Elton was a vain woman , extremely well satisfied with herself , and thinking much of her own importance ; that she meant to shine and be very superior , but with manners which had been formed in a bad school , pert and familiar ; that all her notions were drawn from one set of people , and one style of living ; that if not foolish she was ignorant , and that her society would certainly do Mr . Elton no good . Harriet would have been a better match . If not wise or refined herself , she would have connected him with those who were ; but Miss Hawkins , it might be fairly supposed from her easy conceit , had been the best of her own set . The rich brother - in - law near Bristol was the pride of the alliance , and his place and his carriages were the pride of him .
austen#"The very first subject after being seated was Maple Grove , "" My brother Mr . Suckling ' s seat ;""-- a comparison of Hartfield to Maple Grove . The grounds of Hartfield were small , but neat and pretty ; and the house was modern and well - built . Mrs . Elton seemed most favourably impressed by the size of the room , the entrance , and all that she could see or imagine . "" Very like Maple Grove indeed !-- She was quite struck by the likeness !-- That room was the very shape and size of the morning - room at Maple Grove ; her sister ' s favourite room ."" -- Mr . Elton was appealed to .--"" Was not it astonishingly like ?-- She could really almost fancy herself at Maple Grove ."" "" And the staircase -- You know , as I came in , I observed how very like the staircase was ; placed exactly in the same part of the house ."
austen#I really could not help exclaiming ! I assure you , Miss Woodhouse , it is very delightful to me , to be reminded of a place I am so extremely partial to as Maple Grove . I have spent so many happy months there ! ( with a little sigh of sentiment ). A charming place , undoubtedly . Every body who sees it is struck by its beauty ; but to me , it has been quite a home .
austen#"Whenever you are transplanted , like me , Miss Woodhouse , you will understand how very delightful it is to meet with any thing at all like what one has left behind . I always say this is quite one of the evils of matrimony ."" Emma made as slight a reply as she could ; but it was fully sufficient for Mrs . Elton , who only wanted to be talking herself . "" So extremely like Maple Grove ! And it is not merely the house -- the grounds , I assure you , as far as I could observe , are strikingly like . The laurels at Maple Grove are in the same profusion as here , and stand very much in the same way -- just across the lawn ; and I had a glimpse of a fine large tree , with a bench round it , which put me so exactly in mind !"
austen#"My brother and sister will be enchanted with this place . People who have extensive grounds themselves are always pleased with any thing in the same style ."" Emma doubted the truth of this sentiment . She had a great idea that people who had extensive grounds themselves cared very little for the extensive grounds of any body else ; but it was not worth while to attack an error so double - dyed , and therefore only said in reply , "" When you have seen more of this country , I am afraid you will think you have overrated Hartfield . Surry is full of beauties ."""
austen#""" Oh ! yes , I am quite aware of that . It is the garden of England , you know . Surry is the garden of England ."" "" Yes ; but we must not rest our claims on that distinction . Many counties , I believe , are called the garden of England , as well as Surry ."""
austen#""" No , I fancy not ,"" replied Mrs . Elton , with a most satisfied smile ."" I never heard any county but Surry called so ."" Emma was silenced . "" My brother and sister have promised us a visit in the spring , or summer at farthest ,"" continued Mrs . Elton ; "" and that will be our time for exploring . While they are with us , we shall explore a great deal , I dare say . They will have their barouche - landau , of course , which holds four perfectly ; and therefore , without saying any thing of _our_ carriage , we should be able to explore the different beauties extremely well ."
austen#"They would hardly come in their chaise , I think , at that season of the year . Indeed , when the time draws on , I shall decidedly recommend their bringing the barouche - landau ; it will be so very much preferable . When people come into a beautiful country of this sort , you know , Miss Woodhouse , one naturally wishes them to see as much as possible ; and Mr . Suckling is extremely fond of exploring . We explored to King ' s - Weston twice last summer , in that way , most delightfully , just after their first having the barouche - landau . You have many parties of that kind here , I suppose , Miss Woodhouse , every summer ?"" "" No ; not immediately here ."
austen#"We are rather out of distance of the very striking beauties which attract the sort of parties you speak of ; and we are a very quiet set of people , I believe ; more disposed to stay at home than engage in schemes of pleasure ."" "" Ah ! there is nothing like staying at home for real comfort . Nobody can be more devoted to home than I am . I was quite a proverb for it at Maple Grove . Many a time has Selina said , when she has been going to Bristol , ` I really cannot get this girl to move from the house ."
austen#I absolutely must go in by myself , though I hate being stuck up in the barouche - landau without a companion ; but Augusta , I believe , with her own good - will , would never stir beyond the park paling .' Many a time has she said so ; and yet I am no advocate for entire seclusion . I think , on the contrary , when people shut themselves up entirely from society , it is a very bad thing ; and that it is much more advisable to mix in the world in a proper degree , without living in it either too much or too little . I perfectly understand your situation , however , Miss Woodhouse -- ( looking towards Mr . Woodhouse ), Your father ' s state of health must be a great drawback . Why does not he try Bath ?-- Indeed he should . Let me recommend Bath to you .
austen#"I assure you I have no doubt of its doing Mr . Woodhouse good ."" "" My father tried it more than once , formerly ; but without receiving any benefit ; and Mr . Perry , whose name , I dare say , is not unknown to you , does not conceive it would be at all more likely to be useful now ."" "" Ah ! that ' s a great pity ; for I assure you , Miss Woodhouse , where the waters do agree , it is quite wonderful the relief they give . In my Bath life , I have seen such instances of it ! And it is so cheerful a place , that it could not fail of being of use to Mr . Woodhouse ' s spirits , which , I understand , are sometimes much depressed ."
austen#"And as to its recommendations to _you_ , I fancy I need not take much pains to dwell on them . The advantages of Bath to the young are pretty generally understood . It would be a charming introduction for you , who have lived so secluded a life ; and I could immediately secure you some of the best society in the place . A line from me would bring you a little host of acquaintance ; and my particular friend , Mrs . Partridge , the lady I have always resided with when in Bath , would be most happy to shew you any attentions , and would be the very person for you to go into public with ."" It was as much as Emma could bear , without being impolite . The idea of her being indebted to Mrs . Elton for what was called an _introduction_ -- of her going into public under the auspices of a friend of Mrs . Elton ' s -- probably some vulgar , dashing widow , who , with the help of a boarder , just made a shift to live !-- The dignity of Miss Woodhouse , of Hartfield , was sunk indeed !"
austen#"She restrained herself , however , from any of the reproofs she could have given , and only thanked Mrs . Elton coolly ; "" but their going to Bath was quite out of the question ; and she was not perfectly convinced that the place might suit her better than her father ."" And then , to prevent farther outrage and indignation , changed the subject directly . "" I do not ask whether you are musical , Mrs . Elton . Upon these occasions , a lady ' s character generally precedes her ; and Highbury has long known that you are a superior performer ."" "" Oh ! no , indeed ; I must protest against any such idea ."
austen#A superior performer !-- very far from it , I assure you . Consider from how partial a quarter your information came . I am doatingly fond of music -- passionately fond ;-- and my friends say I am not entirely devoid of taste ; but as to any thing else , upon my honour my performance is _mediocre_ to the last degree . You , Miss Woodhouse , I well know , play delightfully . I assure you it has been the greatest satisfaction , comfort , and delight to me , to hear what a musical society I am got into . I absolutely cannot do without music .
austen#It is a necessary of life to me ; and having always been used to a very musical society , both at Maple Grove and in Bath , it would have been a most serious sacrifice . I honestly said as much to Mr . E . when he was speaking of my future home , and expressing his fears lest the retirement of it should be disagreeable ; and the inferiority of the house too -- knowing what I had been accustomed to -- of course he was not wholly without apprehension . When he was speaking of it in that way , I honestly said that _the_ _world_ I could give up -- parties , balls , plays -- for I had no fear of retirement . Blessed with so many resources within myself , the world was not necessary to _me_ . I could do very well without it . To those who had no resources it was a different thing ; but my resources made me quite independent .
austen#"And as to smaller - sized rooms than I had been used to , I really could not give it a thought . I hoped I was perfectly equal to any sacrifice of that description . Certainly I had been accustomed to every luxury at Maple Grove ; but I did assure him that two carriages were not necessary to my happiness , nor were spacious apartments . ` But ,' said I , ` to be quite honest , I do not think I can live without something of a musical society . I condition for nothing else ; but without music , life would be a blank to me .'"" "" We cannot suppose ,"" said Emma , smiling , "" that Mr . Elton would hesitate to assure you of there being a _very_ musical society in Highbury ; and I hope you will not find he has outstepped the truth more than may be pardoned , in consideration of the motive ."""
austen#""" No , indeed , I have no doubts at all on that head . I am delighted to find myself in such a circle . I hope we shall have many sweet little concerts together . I think , Miss Woodhouse , you and I must establish a musical club , and have regular weekly meetings at your house , or ours . Will not it be a good plan ? If _we_ exert ourselves , I think we shall not be long in want of allies ."
austen#"Something of that nature would be particularly desirable for _me_ , as an inducement to keep me in practice ; for married women , you know -- there is a sad story against them , in general . They are but too apt to give up music ."" "" But you , who are so extremely fond of it -- there can be no danger , surely ?"" "" I should hope not ; but really when I look around among my acquaintance , I tremble . Selina has entirely given up music -- never touches the instrument -- though she played sweetly . And the same may be said of Mrs . Jeffereys -- Clara Partridge , that was -- and of the two Milmans , now Mrs . Bird and Mrs . James Cooper ; and of more than I can enumerate ."
austen#"Upon my word it is enough to put one in a fright . I used to be quite angry with Selina ; but really I begin now to comprehend that a married woman has many things to call her attention . I believe I was half an hour this morning shut up with my housekeeper ."" "" But every thing of that kind ,"" said Emma , "" will soon be in so regular a train --"" "" Well ,"" said Mrs . Elton , laughing , "" we shall see ."" Emma , finding her so determined upon neglecting her music , had nothing more to say ; and , after a moment ' s pause , Mrs . Elton chose another subject ."
austen#""" We have been calling at Randalls ,"" said she , "" and found them both at home ; and very pleasant people they seem to be . I like them extremely . Mr . Weston seems an excellent creature -- quite a first - rate favourite with me already , I assure you . And _she_ appears so truly good -- there is something so motherly and kind - hearted about her , that it wins upon one directly . She was your governess , I think ?"" Emma was almost too much astonished to answer ; but Mrs . Elton hardly waited for the affirmative before she went on ."
austen#""" Having understood as much , I was rather astonished to find her so very lady - like ! But she is really quite the gentlewoman ."" "" Mrs . Weston ' s manners ,"" said Emma , "" were always particularly good . Their propriety , simplicity , and elegance , would make them the safest model for any young woman ."" "" And who do you think came in while we were there ?"" Emma was quite at a loss ."
austen#"The tone implied some old acquaintance -- and how could she possibly guess ? "" Knightley !"" continued Mrs . Elton ; "" Knightley himself !-- Was not it lucky ?-- for , not being within when he called the other day , I had never seen him before ; and of course , as so particular a friend of Mr . E .' s , I had a great curiosity . ` My friend Knightley ' had been so often mentioned , that I was really impatient to see him ; and I must do my caro sposo the justice to say that he need not be ashamed of his friend . Knightley is quite the gentleman . I like him very much ."
austen#"Decidedly , I think , a very gentleman - like man ."" Happily , it was now time to be gone . They were off ; and Emma could breathe . "" Insufferable woman !"" was her immediate exclamation . "" Worse than I had supposed ."
austen#Absolutely insufferable ! Knightley !-- I could not have believed it . Knightley !-- never seen him in her life before , and call him Knightley !-- and discover that he is a gentleman ! A little upstart , vulgar being , with her Mr . E ., and her _caro_ _sposo_ , and her resources , and all her airs of pert pretension and underbred finery . Actually to discover that Mr . Knightley is a gentleman ! I doubt whether he will return the compliment , and discover her to be a lady .
austen#I could not have believed it ! And to propose that she and I should unite to form a musical club ! One would fancy we were bosom friends ! And Mrs . Weston !-- Astonished that the person who had brought me up should be a gentlewoman ! Worse and worse .
austen#I never met with her equal . Much beyond my hopes . Harriet is disgraced by any comparison . Oh ! what would Frank Churchill say to her , if he were here ? How angry and how diverted he would be !
austen#"Ah ! there I am -- thinking of him directly . Always the first person to be thought of ! How I catch myself out ! Frank Churchill comes as regularly into my mind !"" --"
austen#"All this ran so glibly through her thoughts , that by the time her father had arranged himself , after the bustle of the Eltons ' departure , and was ready to speak , she was very tolerably capable of attending . "" Well , my dear ,"" he deliberately began , "" considering we never saw her before , she seems a very pretty sort of young lady ; and I dare say she was very much pleased with you . She speaks a little too quick . A little quickness of voice there is which rather hurts the ear . But I believe I am nice ; I do not like strange voices ; and nobody speaks like you and poor Miss Taylor . However , she seems a very obliging , pretty - behaved young lady , and no doubt will make him a very good wife ."
austen#Though I think he had better not have married . I made the best excuses I could for not having been able to wait on him and Mrs . Elton on this happy occasion ; I said that I hoped I _should_ in the course of the summer . But I ought to have gone before . Not to wait upon a bride is very remiss . Ah ! it shews what a sad invalid I am !
austen#"But I do not like the corner into Vicarage Lane ."" "" I dare say your apologies were accepted , sir . Mr . Elton knows you ."" "" Yes : but a young lady -- a bride -- I ought to have paid my respects to her if possible . It was being very deficient ."" "" But , my dear papa , you are no friend to matrimony ; and therefore why should you be so anxious to pay your respects to a _bride_ ?"
austen#"It ought to be no recommendation to _you_ . It is encouraging people to marry if you make so much of them ."" "" No , my dear , I never encouraged any body to marry , but I would always wish to pay every proper attention to a lady -- and a bride , especially , is never to be neglected . More is avowedly due to _her_ . A bride , you know , my dear , is always the first in company , let the others be who they may ."" "" Well , papa , if this is not encouragement to marry , I do not know what is ."
austen#"And I should never have expected you to be lending your sanction to such vanity - baits for poor young ladies ."" "" My dear , you do not understand me . This is a matter of mere common politeness and good - breeding , and has nothing to do with any encouragement to people to marry ."" Emma had done . Her father was growing nervous , and could not understand _her_ . Her mind returned to Mrs . Elton ' s offences , and long , very long , did they occupy her ."
austen#CHAPTER XV Emma was not required , by any subsequent discovery , to retract her ill opinion of Mrs . Elton . Her observation had been pretty correct . Such as Mrs . Elton appeared to her on this second interview , such she appeared whenever they met again ,-- self - important , presuming , familiar , ignorant , and ill - bred . She had a little beauty and a little accomplishment , but so little judgment that she thought herself coming with superior knowledge of the world , to enliven and improve a country neighbourhood ; and conceived Miss Hawkins to have held such a place in society as Mrs . Elton ' s consequence only could surpass . There was no reason to suppose Mr . Elton thought at all differently from his wife .
austen#"He seemed not merely happy with her , but proud . He had the air of congratulating himself on having brought such a woman to Highbury , as not even Miss Woodhouse could equal ; and the greater part of her new acquaintance , disposed to commend , or not in the habit of judging , following the lead of Miss Bates ' s good - will , or taking it for granted that the bride must be as clever and as agreeable as she professed herself , were very well satisfied ; so that Mrs . Elton ' s praise passed from one mouth to another as it ought to do , unimpeded by Miss Woodhouse , who readily continued her first contribution and talked with a good grace of her being "" very pleasant and very elegantly dressed ."" In one respect Mrs . Elton grew even worse than she had appeared at first . Her feelings altered towards Emma .-- Offended , probably , by the little encouragement which her proposals of intimacy met with , she drew back in her turn and gradually became much more cold and distant ; and though the effect was agreeable , the ill - will which produced it was necessarily increasing Emma ' s dislike . Her manners , too -- and Mr . Elton ' s , were unpleasant towards Harriet . They were sneering and negligent ."
austen#"Emma hoped it must rapidly work Harriet ' s cure ; but the sensations which could prompt such behaviour sunk them both very much .-- It was not to be doubted that poor Harriet ' s attachment had been an offering to conjugal unreserve , and her own share in the story , under a colouring the least favourable to her and the most soothing to him , had in all likelihood been given also . She was , of course , the object of their joint dislike .-- When they had nothing else to say , it must be always easy to begin abusing Miss Woodhouse ; and the enmity which they dared not shew in open disrespect to her , found a broader vent in contemptuous treatment of Harriet . Mrs . Elton took a great fancy to Jane Fairfax ; and from the first . Not merely when a state of warfare with one young lady might be supposed to recommend the other , but from the very first ; and she was not satisfied with expressing a natural and reasonable admiration -- but without solicitation , or plea , or privilege , she must be wanting to assist and befriend her .-- Before Emma had forfeited her confidence , and about the third time of their meeting , she heard all Mrs . Elton ' s knight - errantry on the subject .-- "" Jane Fairfax is absolutely charming , Miss Woodhouse .-- I quite rave about Jane Fairfax .-- A sweet , interesting creature . So mild and ladylike -- and with such talents !-- I assure you I think she has very extraordinary talents ."
austen#I do not scruple to say that she plays extremely well . I know enough of music to speak decidedly on that point . Oh ! she is absolutely charming ! You will laugh at my warmth -- but , upon my word , I talk of nothing but Jane Fairfax .-- And her situation is so calculated to affect one !-- Miss Woodhouse , we must exert ourselves and endeavour to do something for her . We must bring her forward .
austen#"Such talent as hers must not be suffered to remain unknown .-- I dare say you have heard those charming lines of the poet , ` Full many a flower is born to blush unseen , ` And waste its fragrance on the desert air .' We must not allow them to be verified in sweet Jane Fairfax ."" "" I cannot think there is any danger of it ,"" was Emma ' s calm answer -- "" and when you are better acquainted with Miss Fairfax ' s situation and understand what her home has been , with Colonel and Mrs . Campbell , I have no idea that you will suppose her talents can be unknown ."" "" Oh ! but dear Miss Woodhouse , she is now in such retirement , such obscurity , so thrown away .-- Whatever advantages she may have enjoyed with the Campbells are so palpably at an end !"
austen#And I think she feels it . I am sure she does . She is very timid and silent . One can see that she feels the want of encouragement . I like her the better for it . I must confess it is a recommendation to me .
austen#"I am a great advocate for timidity -- and I am sure one does not often meet with it .-- But in those who are at all inferior , it is extremely prepossessing . Oh ! I assure you , Jane Fairfax is a very delightful character , and interests me more than I can express ."" "" You appear to feel a great deal -- but I am not aware how you or any of Miss Fairfax ' s acquaintance here , any of those who have known her longer than yourself , can shew her any other attention than ""-- "" My dear Miss Woodhouse , a vast deal may be done by those who dare to act . You and I need not be afraid ."
austen#If _we_ set the example , many will follow it as far as they can ; though all have not our situations . _We_ have carriages to fetch and convey her home , and _we_ live in a style which could not make the addition of Jane Fairfax , at any time , the least inconvenient .-- I should be extremely displeased if Wright were to send us up such a dinner , as could make me regret having asked _more_ than Jane Fairfax to partake of it . I have no idea of that sort of thing . It is not likely that I _should_ , considering what I have been used to . My greatest danger , perhaps , in housekeeping , may be quite the other way , in doing too much , and being too careless of expense . Maple Grove will probably be my model more than it ought to be -- for we do not at all affect to equal my brother , Mr . Suckling , in income .-- However , my resolution is taken as to noticing Jane Fairfax .-- I shall certainly have her very often at my house , shall introduce her wherever I can , shall have musical parties to draw out her talents , and shall be constantly on the watch for an eligible situation .
austen#"My acquaintance is so very extensive , that I have little doubt of hearing of something to suit her shortly .-- I shall introduce her , of course , very particularly to my brother and sister when they come to us . I am sure they will like her extremely ; and when she gets a little acquainted with them , her fears will completely wear off , for there really is nothing in the manners of either but what is highly conciliating .-- I shall have her very often indeed while they are with me , and I dare say we shall sometimes find a seat for her in the barouche - landau in some of our exploring parties ."" "" Poor Jane Fairfax !"" -- thought Emma .--"" You have not deserved this . You may have done wrong with regard to Mr . Dixon , but this is a punishment beyond what you can have merited !-- The kindness and protection of Mrs . Elton !--` Jane Fairfax and Jane Fairfax .'"
austen#"Heavens ! Let me not suppose that she dares go about , Emma Woodhouse - ing me !-- But upon my honour , there seems no limits to the licentiousness of that woman ' s tongue !"" Emma had not to listen to such paradings again -- to any so exclusively addressed to herself -- so disgustingly decorated with a "" dear Miss Woodhouse ."" The change on Mrs . Elton ' s side soon afterwards appeared , and she was left in peace -- neither forced to be the very particular friend of Mrs . Elton , nor , under Mrs . Elton ' s guidance , the very active patroness of Jane Fairfax , and only sharing with others in a general way , in knowing what was felt , what was meditated , what was done . She looked on with some amusement .-- Miss Bates ' s gratitude for Mrs . Elton ' s attentions to Jane was in the first style of guileless simplicity and warmth . She was quite one of her worthies -- the most amiable , affable , delightful woman -- just as accomplished and condescending as Mrs . Elton meant to be considered ."
austen#"Emma ' s only surprize was that Jane Fairfax should accept those attentions and tolerate Mrs . Elton as she seemed to do . She heard of her walking with the Eltons , sitting with the Eltons , spending a day with the Eltons ! This was astonishing !-- She could not have believed it possible that the taste or the pride of Miss Fairfax could endure such society and friendship as the Vicarage had to offer . "" She is a riddle , quite a riddle !"" said she .--"" To chuse to remain here month after month , under privations of every sort ! And now to chuse the mortification of Mrs . Elton ' s notice and the penury of her conversation , rather than return to the superior companions who have always loved her with such real , generous affection ."""
austen#"Jane had come to Highbury professedly for three months ; the Campbells were gone to Ireland for three months ; but now the Campbells had promised their daughter to stay at least till Midsummer , and fresh invitations had arrived for her to join them there . According to Miss Bates -- it all came from her -- Mrs . Dixon had written most pressingly . Would Jane but go , means were to be found , servants sent , friends contrived -- no travelling difficulty allowed to exist ; but still she had declined it ! "" She must have some motive , more powerful than appears , for refusing this invitation ,"" was Emma ' s conclusion . "" She must be under some sort of penance , inflicted either by the Campbells or herself . There is great fear , great caution , great resolution somewhere .-- She is _not_ to be with the _Dixons_ ."
austen#"The decree is issued by somebody . But why must she consent to be with the Eltons ?-- Here is quite a separate puzzle ."" Upon her speaking her wonder aloud on that part of the subject , before the few who knew her opinion of Mrs . Elton , Mrs . Weston ventured this apology for Jane . "" We cannot suppose that she has any great enjoyment at the Vicarage , my dear Emma -- but it is better than being always at home . Her aunt is a good creature , but , as a constant companion , must be very tiresome . We must consider what Miss Fairfax quits , before we condemn her taste for what she goes to ."""
austen#""" You are right , Mrs . Weston ,"" said Mr . Knightley warmly , "" Miss Fairfax is as capable as any of us of forming a just opinion of Mrs . Elton . Could she have chosen with whom to associate , she would not have chosen her . But ( with a reproachful smile at Emma ) she receives attentions from Mrs . Elton , which nobody else pays her ."" Emma felt that Mrs . Weston was giving her a momentary glance ; and she was herself struck by his warmth . With a faint blush , she presently replied , "" Such attentions as Mrs . Elton ' s , I should have imagined , would rather disgust than gratify Miss Fairfax ."
austen#"Mrs . Elton ' s invitations I should have imagined any thing but inviting ."" "" I should not wonder ,"" said Mrs . Weston , "" if Miss Fairfax were to have been drawn on beyond her own inclination , by her aunt ' s eagerness in accepting Mrs . Elton ' s civilities for her . Poor Miss Bates may very likely have committed her niece and hurried her into a greater appearance of intimacy than her own good sense would have dictated , in spite of the very natural wish of a little change ."" Both felt rather anxious to hear him speak again ; and after a few minutes silence , he said , "" Another thing must be taken into consideration too -- Mrs . Elton does not talk _to_ Miss Fairfax as she speaks _of_ her . We all know the difference between the pronouns he or she and thou , the plainest spoken amongst us ; we all feel the influence of a something beyond common civility in our personal intercourse with each other -- a something more early implanted ."
austen#"We cannot give any body the disagreeable hints that we may have been very full of the hour before . We feel things differently . And besides the operation of this , as a general principle , you may be sure that Miss Fairfax awes Mrs . Elton by her superiority both of mind and manner ; and that , face to face , Mrs . Elton treats her with all the respect which she has a claim to . Such a woman as Jane Fairfax probably never fell in Mrs . Elton ' s way before -- and no degree of vanity can prevent her acknowledging her own comparative littleness in action , if not in consciousness ."" "" I know how highly you think of Jane Fairfax ,"" said Emma . Little Henry was in her thoughts , and a mixture of alarm and delicacy made her irresolute what else to say ."
austen#""" Yes ,"" he replied , "" any body may know how highly I think of her ."" "" And yet ,"" said Emma , beginning hastily and with an arch look , but soon stopping -- it was better , however , to know the worst at once -- she hurried on --"" And yet , perhaps , you may hardly be aware yourself how highly it is . The extent of your admiration may take you by surprize some day or other ."" Mr . Knightley was hard at work upon the lower buttons of his thick leather gaiters , and either the exertion of getting them together , or some other cause , brought the colour into his face , as he answered , "" Oh ! are you there ?-- But you are miserably behindhand ."
austen#"Mr . Cole gave me a hint of it six weeks ago ."" He stopped .-- Emma felt her foot pressed by Mrs . Weston , and did not herself know what to think . In a moment he went on -- "" That will never be , however , I can assure you . Miss Fairfax , I dare say , would not have me if I were to ask her -- and I am very sure I shall never ask her ."" Emma returned her friend ' s pressure with interest ; and was pleased enough to exclaim ,"
austen#""" You are not vain , Mr . Knightley . I will say that for you ."" He seemed hardly to hear her ; he was thoughtful -- and in a manner which shewed him not pleased , soon afterwards said , "" So you have been settling that I should marry Jane Fairfax ?"" "" No indeed I have not . You have scolded me too much for match - making , for me to presume to take such a liberty with you ."
austen#"What I said just now , meant nothing . One says those sort of things , of course , without any idea of a serious meaning . Oh ! no , upon my word I have not the smallest wish for your marrying Jane Fairfax or Jane any body . You would not come in and sit with us in this comfortable way , if you were married ."" Mr . Knightley was thoughtful again ."
austen#"The result of his reverie was , "" No , Emma , I do not think the extent of my admiration for her will ever take me by surprize .-- I never had a thought of her in that way , I assure you ."" And soon afterwards , "" Jane Fairfax is a very charming young woman -- but not even Jane Fairfax is perfect . She has a fault . She has not the open temper which a man would wish for in a wife ."" Emma could not but rejoice to hear that she had a fault . "" Well ,"" said she , "" and you soon silenced Mr . Cole , I suppose ?"""
austen#""" Yes , very soon . He gave me a quiet hint ; I told him he was mistaken ; he asked my pardon and said no more . Cole does not want to be wiser or wittier than his neighbours ."" "" In that respect how unlike dear Mrs . Elton , who wants to be wiser and wittier than all the world ! I wonder how she speaks of the Coles -- what she calls them ! How can she find any appellation for them , deep enough in familiar vulgarity ?"
austen#"She calls you , Knightley -- what can she do for Mr . Cole ? And so I am not to be surprized that Jane Fairfax accepts her civilities and consents to be with her . Mrs . Weston , your argument weighs most with me . I can much more readily enter into the temptation of getting away from Miss Bates , than I can believe in the triumph of Miss Fairfax ' s mind over Mrs . Elton . I have no faith in Mrs . Elton ' s acknowledging herself the inferior in thought , word , or deed ; or in her being under any restraint beyond her own scanty rule of good - breeding . I cannot imagine that she will not be continually insulting her visitor with praise , encouragement , and offers of service ; that she will not be continually detailing her magnificent intentions , from the procuring her a permanent situation to the including her in those delightful exploring parties which are to take place in the barouche - landau ."""
austen#""" Jane Fairfax has feeling ,"" said Mr . Knightley --"" I do not accuse her of want of feeling . Her sensibilities , I suspect , are strong -- and her temper excellent in its power of forbearance , patience , self - controul ; but it wants openness . She is reserved , more reserved , I think , than she used to be -- And I love an open temper . No -- till Cole alluded to my supposed attachment , it had never entered my head . I saw Jane Fairfax and conversed with her , with admiration and pleasure always -- but with no thought beyond ."" "" Well , Mrs . Weston ,"" said Emma triumphantly when he left them , "" what do you say now to Mr . Knightley ' s marrying Jane Fairfax ?"""
austen#""" Why , really , dear Emma , I say that he is so very much occupied by the idea of _not_ being in love with her , that I should not wonder if it were to end in his being so at last . Do not beat me ."" CHAPTER XVI Every body in and about Highbury who had ever visited Mr . Elton , was disposed to pay him attention on his marriage . Dinner - parties and evening - parties were made for him and his lady ; and invitations flowed in so fast that she had soon the pleasure of apprehending they were never to have a disengaged day . "" I see how it is ,"" said she ."
austen#""" I see what a life I am to lead among you . Upon my word we shall be absolutely dissipated . We really seem quite the fashion . If this is living in the country , it is nothing very formidable . From Monday next to Saturday , I assure you we have not a disengaged day !-- A woman with fewer resources than I have , need not have been at a loss ."" No invitation came amiss to her ."
austen#Her Bath habits made evening - parties perfectly natural to her , and Maple Grove had given her a taste for dinners . She was a little shocked at the want of two drawing rooms , at the poor attempt at rout - cakes , and there being no ice in the Highbury card - parties . Mrs . Bates , Mrs . Perry , Mrs . Goddard and others , were a good deal behind - hand in knowledge of the world , but she would soon shew them how every thing ought to be arranged . In the course of the spring she must return their civilities by one very superior party -- in which her card - tables should be set out with their separate candles and unbroken packs in the true style -- and more waiters engaged for the evening than their own establishment could furnish , to carry round the refreshments at exactly the proper hour , and in the proper order . Emma , in the meanwhile , could not be satisfied without a dinner at Hartfield for the Eltons . They must not do less than others , or she should be exposed to odious suspicions , and imagined capable of pitiful resentment .
austen#"A dinner there must be . After Emma had talked about it for ten minutes , Mr . Woodhouse felt no unwillingness , and only made the usual stipulation of not sitting at the bottom of the table himself , with the usual regular difficulty of deciding who should do it for him . The persons to be invited , required little thought . Besides the Eltons , it must be the Westons and Mr . Knightley ; so far it was all of course -- and it was hardly less inevitable that poor little Harriet must be asked to make the eighth :-- but this invitation was not given with equal satisfaction , and on many accounts Emma was particularly pleased by Harriet ' s begging to be allowed to decline it . "" She would rather not be in his company more than she could help . She was not yet quite able to see him and his charming happy wife together , without feeling uncomfortable ."
austen#"If Miss Woodhouse would not be displeased , she would rather stay at home ."" It was precisely what Emma would have wished , had she deemed it possible enough for wishing . She was delighted with the fortitude of her little friend -- for fortitude she knew it was in her to give up being in company and stay at home ; and she could now invite the very person whom she really wanted to make the eighth , Jane Fairfax .-- Since her last conversation with Mrs . Weston and Mr . Knightley , she was more conscience - stricken about Jane Fairfax than she had often been .-- Mr . Knightley ' s words dwelt with her . He had said that Jane Fairfax received attentions from Mrs . Elton which nobody else paid her . "" This is very true ,"" said she , "" at least as far as relates to me , which was all that was meant -- and it is very shameful .-- Of the same age -- and always knowing her -- I ought to have been more her friend .-- She will never like me now ."
austen#"I have neglected her too long . But I will shew her greater attention than I have done ."" Every invitation was successful . They were all disengaged and all happy .-- The preparatory interest of this dinner , however , was not yet over . A circumstance rather unlucky occurred . The two eldest little Knightleys were engaged to pay their grandpapa and aunt a visit of some weeks in the spring , and their papa now proposed bringing them , and staying one whole day at Hartfield -- which one day would be the very day of this party .-- His professional engagements did not allow of his being put off , but both father and daughter were disturbed by its happening so ."
austen#Mr . Woodhouse considered eight persons at dinner together as the utmost that his nerves could bear -- and here would be a ninth -- and Emma apprehended that it would be a ninth very much out of humour at not being able to come even to Hartfield for forty - eight hours without falling in with a dinner - party . She comforted her father better than she could comfort herself , by representing that though he certainly would make them nine , yet he always said so little , that the increase of noise would be very immaterial . She thought it in reality a sad exchange for herself , to have him with his grave looks and reluctant conversation opposed to her instead of his brother . The event was more favourable to Mr . Woodhouse than to Emma . John Knightley came ; but Mr . Weston was unexpectedly summoned to town and must be absent on the very day . He might be able to join them in the evening , but certainly not to dinner .
austen#Mr . Woodhouse was quite at ease ; and the seeing him so , with the arrival of the little boys and the philosophic composure of her brother on hearing his fate , removed the chief of even Emma ' s vexation . The day came , the party were punctually assembled , and Mr . John Knightley seemed early to devote himself to the business of being agreeable . Instead of drawing his brother off to a window while they waited for dinner , he was talking to Miss Fairfax . Mrs . Elton , as elegant as lace and pearls could make her , he looked at in silence -- wanting only to observe enough for Isabella ' s information -- but Miss Fairfax was an old acquaintance and a quiet girl , and he could talk to her . He had met her before breakfast as he was returning from a walk with his little boys , when it had been just beginning to rain . It was natural to have some civil hopes on the subject , and he said ,
austen#""" I hope you did not venture far , Miss Fairfax , this morning , or I am sure you must have been wet .-- We scarcely got home in time . I hope you turned directly ."" "" I went only to the post - office ,"" said she , "" and reached home before the rain was much . It is my daily errand . I always fetch the letters when I am here . It saves trouble , and is a something to get me out ."
austen#"A walk before breakfast does me good ."" "" Not a walk in the rain , I should imagine ."" "" No , but it did not absolutely rain when I set out ."" Mr . John Knightley smiled , and replied , "" That is to say , you chose to have your walk , for you were not six yards from your own door when I had the pleasure of meeting you ; and Henry and John had seen more drops than they could count long before . The post - office has a great charm at one period of our lives ."
austen#"When you have lived to my age , you will begin to think letters are never worth going through the rain for ."" There was a little blush , and then this answer , "" I must not hope to be ever situated as you are , in the midst of every dearest connexion , and therefore I cannot expect that simply growing older should make me indifferent about letters ."" "" Indifferent ! Oh ! no -- I never conceived you could become indifferent ."
austen#"Letters are no matter of indifference ; they are generally a very positive curse ."" "" You are speaking of letters of business ; mine are letters of friendship ."" "" I have often thought them the worst of the two ,"" replied he coolly . "" Business , you know , may bring money , but friendship hardly ever does ."" "" Ah ! you are not serious now ."
austen#"I know Mr . John Knightley too well -- I am very sure he understands the value of friendship as well as any body . I can easily believe that letters are very little to you , much less than to me , but it is not your being ten years older than myself which makes the difference , it is not age , but situation . You have every body dearest to you always at hand , I , probably , never shall again ; and therefore till I have outlived all my affections , a post - office , I think , must always have power to draw me out , in worse weather than to - day ."" "" When I talked of your being altered by time , by the progress of years ,"" said John Knightley , "" I meant to imply the change of situation which time usually brings . I consider one as including the other . Time will generally lessen the interest of every attachment not within the daily circle -- but that is not the change I had in view for you ."
austen#"As an old friend , you will allow me to hope , Miss Fairfax , that ten years hence you may have as many concentrated objects as I have ."" It was kindly said , and very far from giving offence . A pleasant "" thank you "" seemed meant to laugh it off , but a blush , a quivering lip , a tear in the eye , shewed that it was felt beyond a laugh . Her attention was now claimed by Mr . Woodhouse , who being , according to his custom on such occasions , making the circle of his guests , and paying his particular compliments to the ladies , was ending with her -- and with all his mildest urbanity , said , "" I am very sorry to hear , Miss Fairfax , of your being out this morning in the rain . Young ladies should take care of themselves .-- Young ladies are delicate plants ."
austen#"They should take care of their health and their complexion . My dear , did you change your stockings ?"" "" Yes , sir , I did indeed ; and I am very much obliged by your kind solicitude about me ."" "" My dear Miss Fairfax , young ladies are very sure to be cared for .-- I hope your good grand - mama and aunt are well . They are some of my very old friends . I wish my health allowed me to be a better neighbour ."
austen#"You do us a great deal of honour to - day , I am sure . My daughter and I are both highly sensible of your goodness , and have the greatest satisfaction in seeing you at Hartfield ."" The kind - hearted , polite old man might then sit down and feel that he had done his duty , and made every fair lady welcome and easy . By this time , the walk in the rain had reached Mrs . Elton , and her remonstrances now opened upon Jane . "" My dear Jane , what is this I hear ?-- Going to the post - office in the rain !-- This must not be , I assure you .-- You sad girl , how could you do such a thing ?-- It is a sign I was not there to take care of you ."" Jane very patiently assured her that she had not caught any cold ."
austen#""" Oh ! do not tell _me_ . You really are a very sad girl , and do not know how to take care of yourself .-- To the post - office indeed ! Mrs . Weston , did you ever hear the like ? You and I must positively exert our authority ."" "" My advice ,"" said Mrs . Weston kindly and persuasively , "" I certainly do feel tempted to give ."
austen#"Miss Fairfax , you must not run such risks .-- Liable as you have been to severe colds , indeed you ought to be particularly careful , especially at this time of year . The spring I always think requires more than common care . Better wait an hour or two , or even half a day for your letters , than run the risk of bringing on your cough again . Now do not you feel that you had ? Yes , I am sure you are much too reasonable . You look as if you would not do such a thing again ."""
austen#""" Oh ! she _shall_ _not_ do such a thing again ,"" eagerly rejoined Mrs . Elton . "" We will not allow her to do such a thing again :""-- and nodding significantly --"" there must be some arrangement made , there must indeed . I shall speak to Mr . E . The man who fetches our letters every morning ( one of our men , I forget his name ) shall inquire for yours too and bring them to you . That will obviate all difficulties you know ; and from _us_ I really think , my dear Jane , you can have no scruple to accept such an accommodation ."" "" You are extremely kind ,"" said Jane ; "" but I cannot give up my early walk ."
austen#"I am advised to be out of doors as much as I can , I must walk somewhere , and the post - office is an object ; and upon my word , I have scarcely ever had a bad morning before ."" "" My dear Jane , say no more about it . The thing is determined , that is ( laughing affectedly ) as far as I can presume to determine any thing without the concurrence of my lord and master . You know , Mrs . Weston , you and I must be cautious how we express ourselves . But I do flatter myself , my dear Jane , that my influence is not entirely worn out . If I meet with no insuperable difficulties therefore , consider that point as settled ."""
austen#""" Excuse me ,"" said Jane earnestly , "" I cannot by any means consent to such an arrangement , so needlessly troublesome to your servant . If the errand were not a pleasure to me , it could be done , as it always is when I am not here , by my grandmama ' s ."" "" Oh ! my dear ; but so much as Patty has to do !-- And it is a kindness to employ our men ."" Jane looked as if she did not mean to be conquered ; but instead of answering , she began speaking again to Mr . John Knightley . "" The post - office is a wonderful establishment !"""
austen#"said she .-- "" The regularity and despatch of it ! If one thinks of all that it has to do , and all that it does so well , it is really astonishing !"" "" It is certainly very well regulated ."" "" So seldom that any negligence or blunder appears ! So seldom that a letter , among the thousands that are constantly passing about the kingdom , is even carried wrong -- and not one in a million , I suppose , actually lost ! And when one considers the variety of hands , and of bad hands too , that are to be deciphered , it increases the wonder ."""
austen#""" The clerks grow expert from habit .-- They must begin with some quickness of sight and hand , and exercise improves them . If you want any farther explanation ,"" continued he , smiling , "" they are paid for it . That is the key to a great deal of capacity . The public pays and must be served well ."" The varieties of handwriting were farther talked of , and the usual observations made . "" I have heard it asserted ,"" said John Knightley , "" that the same sort of handwriting often prevails in a family ; and where the same master teaches , it is natural enough ."
austen#"But for that reason , I should imagine the likeness must be chiefly confined to the females , for boys have very little teaching after an early age , and scramble into any hand they can get . Isabella and Emma , I think , do write very much alike . I have not always known their writing apart ."" "" Yes ,"" said his brother hesitatingly , "" there is a likeness . I know what you mean -- but Emma ' s hand is the strongest ."" "" Isabella and Emma both write beautifully ,"" said Mr . Woodhouse ; "" and always did ."
austen#"And so does poor Mrs . Weston ""-- with half a sigh and half a smile at her . "" I never saw any gentleman ' s handwriting ""-- Emma began , looking also at Mrs . Weston ; but stopped , on perceiving that Mrs . Weston was attending to some one else -- and the pause gave her time to reflect , "" Now , how am I going to introduce him ?-- Am I unequal to speaking his name at once before all these people ? Is it necessary for me to use any roundabout phrase ?-- Your Yorkshire friend -- your correspondent in Yorkshire ;-- that would be the way , I suppose , if I were very bad .-- No , I can pronounce his name without the smallest distress . I certainly get better and better .-- Now for it ."" Mrs . Weston was disengaged and Emma began again --"" Mr . Frank Churchill writes one of the best gentleman ' s hands I ever saw ."" "" I do not admire it ,"" said Mr . Knightley ."
austen#""" It is too small -- wants strength . It is like a woman ' s writing ."" This was not submitted to by either lady . They vindicated him against the base aspersion . "" No , it by no means wanted strength -- it was not a large hand , but very clear and certainly strong . Had not Mrs . Weston any letter about her to produce ?"""
austen#"No , she had heard from him very lately , but having answered the letter , had put it away . "" If we were in the other room ,"" said Emma , "" if I had my writing - desk , I am sure I could produce a specimen . I have a note of his .-- Do not you remember , Mrs . Weston , employing him to write for you one day ?"" "" He chose to say he was employed ""-- "" Well , well , I have that note ; and can shew it after dinner to convince Mr . Knightley ."""
austen#""" Oh ! when a gallant young man , like Mr . Frank Churchill ,"" said Mr . Knightley dryly , "" writes to a fair lady like Miss Woodhouse , he will , of course , put forth his best ."" Dinner was on table .-- Mrs . Elton , before she could be spoken to , was ready ; and before Mr . Woodhouse had reached her with his request to be allowed to hand her into the dining - parlour , was saying -- "" Must I go first ? I really am ashamed of always leading the way ."""
austen#Jane ' s solicitude about fetching her own letters had not escaped Emma . She had heard and seen it all ; and felt some curiosity to know whether the wet walk of this morning had produced any . She suspected that it _had_ ; that it would not have been so resolutely encountered but in full expectation of hearing from some one very dear , and that it had not been in vain . She thought there was an air of greater happiness than usual -- a glow both of complexion and spirits . She could have made an inquiry or two , as to the expedition and the expense of the Irish mails ;-- it was at her tongue ' s end -- but she abstained . She was quite determined not to utter a word that should hurt Jane Fairfax ' s feelings ; and they followed the other ladies out of the room , arm in arm , with an appearance of good - will highly becoming to the beauty and grace of each .
austen#"CHAPTER XVII When the ladies returned to the drawing - room after dinner , Emma found it hardly possible to prevent their making two distinct parties ;-- with so much perseverance in judging and behaving ill did Mrs . Elton engross Jane Fairfax and slight herself . She and Mrs . Weston were obliged to be almost always either talking together or silent together . Mrs . Elton left them no choice . If Jane repressed her for a little time , she soon began again ; and though much that passed between them was in a half - whisper , especially on Mrs . Elton ' s side , there was no avoiding a knowledge of their principal subjects : The post - office -- catching cold -- fetching letters -- and friendship , were long under discussion ; and to them succeeded one , which must be at least equally unpleasant to Jane -- inquiries whether she had yet heard of any situation likely to suit her , and professions of Mrs . Elton ' s meditated activity . "" Here is April come !"""
austen#"said she , "" I get quite anxious about you . June will soon be here ."" "" But I have never fixed on June or any other month -- merely looked forward to the summer in general ."" "" But have you really heard of nothing ?"" "" I have not even made any inquiry ; I do not wish to make any yet ."" "" Oh !"
austen#"my dear , we cannot begin too early ; you are not aware of the difficulty of procuring exactly the desirable thing ."" "" I not aware !"" said Jane , shaking her head ; "" dear Mrs . Elton , who can have thought of it as I have done ?"" "" But you have not seen so much of the world as I have . You do not know how many candidates there always are for the _first_ situations . I saw a vast deal of that in the neighbourhood round Maple Grove ."
austen#"A cousin of Mr . Suckling , Mrs . Bragge , had such an infinity of applications ; every body was anxious to be in her family , for she moves in the first circle . Wax - candles in the schoolroom ! You may imagine how desirable ! Of all houses in the kingdom Mrs . Bragge ' s is the one I would most wish to see you in ."" "" Colonel and Mrs . Campbell are to be in town again by midsummer ,"" said Jane . "" I must spend some time with them ; I am sure they will want it ;-- afterwards I may probably be glad to dispose of myself ."
austen#"But I would not wish you to take the trouble of making any inquiries at present ."" "" Trouble ! aye , I know your scruples . You are afraid of giving me trouble ; but I assure you , my dear Jane , the Campbells can hardly be more interested about you than I am . I shall write to Mrs . Partridge in a day or two , and shall give her a strict charge to be on the look - out for any thing eligible ."" "" Thank you , but I would rather you did not mention the subject to her ; till the time draws nearer , I do not wish to be giving any body trouble ."""
austen#""" But , my dear child , the time is drawing near ; here is April , and June , or say even July , is very near , with such business to accomplish before us . Your inexperience really amuses me ! A situation such as you deserve , and your friends would require for you , is no everyday occurrence , is not obtained at a moment ' s notice ; indeed , indeed , we must begin inquiring directly ."" "" Excuse me , ma ' am , but this is by no means my intention ; I make no inquiry myself , and should be sorry to have any made by my friends . When I am quite determined as to the time , I am not at all afraid of being long unemployed . There are places in town , offices , where inquiry would soon produce something -- Offices for the sale -- not quite of human flesh -- but of human intellect ."""
austen#""" Oh ! my dear , human flesh ! You quite shock me ; if you mean a fling at the slave - trade , I assure you Mr . Suckling was always rather a friend to the abolition ."" "" I did not mean , I was not thinking of the slave - trade ,"" replied Jane ; "" governess - trade , I assure you , was all that I had in view ; widely different certainly as to the guilt of those who carry it on ; but as to the greater misery of the victims , I do not know where it lies . But I only mean to say that there are advertising offices , and that by applying to them I should have no doubt of very soon meeting with something that would do ."" "" Something that would do !"""
austen#"repeated Mrs . Elton . "" Aye , _that_ may suit your humble ideas of yourself ;-- I know what a modest creature you are ; but it will not satisfy your friends to have you taking up with any thing that may offer , any inferior , commonplace situation , in a family not moving in a certain circle , or able to command the elegancies of life ."" "" You are very obliging ; but as to all that , I am very indifferent ; it would be no object to me to be with the rich ; my mortifications , I think , would only be the greater ; I should suffer more from comparison . A gentleman ' s family is all that I should condition for ."" "" I know you , I know you ; you would take up with any thing ; but I shall be a little more nice , and I am sure the good Campbells will be quite on my side ; with your superior talents , you have a right to move in the first circle . Your musical knowledge alone would entitle you to name your own terms , have as many rooms as you like , and mix in the family as much as you chose ;-- that is -- I do not know -- if you knew the harp , you might do all that , I am very sure ; but you sing as well as play ;-- yes , I really believe you might , even without the harp , stipulate for what you chose ;-- and you must and shall be delightfully , honourably and comfortably settled before the Campbells or I have any rest ."""
austen#""" You may well class the delight , the honour , and the comfort of such a situation together ,"" said Jane , "" they are pretty sure to be equal ; however , I am very serious in not wishing any thing to be attempted at present for me . I am exceedingly obliged to you , Mrs . Elton , I am obliged to any body who feels for me , but I am quite serious in wishing nothing to be done till the summer . For two or three months longer I shall remain where I am , and as I am ."" "" And I am quite serious too , I assure you ,"" replied Mrs . Elton gaily , "" in resolving to be always on the watch , and employing my friends to watch also , that nothing really unexceptionable may pass us ."" In this style she ran on ; never thoroughly stopped by any thing till Mr . Woodhouse came into the room ; her vanity had then a change of object , and Emma heard her saying in the same half - whisper to Jane , "" Here comes this dear old beau of mine , I protest !-- Only think of his gallantry in coming away before the other men !-- what a dear creature he is ;-- I assure you I like him excessively ."
austen#I admire all that quaint , old - fashioned politeness ; it is much more to my taste than modern ease ; modern ease often disgusts me . But this good old Mr . Woodhouse , I wish you had heard his gallant speeches to me at dinner . Oh ! I assure you I began to think my caro sposo would be absolutely jealous . I fancy I am rather a favourite ; he took notice of my gown . How do you like it ?-- Selina ' s choice -- handsome , I think , but I do not know whether it is not over - trimmed ; I have the greatest dislike to the idea of being over - trimmed -- quite a horror of finery .
austen#"I must put on a few ornaments now , because it is expected of me . A bride , you know , must appear like a bride , but my natural taste is all for simplicity ; a simple style of dress is so infinitely preferable to finery . But I am quite in the minority , I believe ; few people seem to value simplicity of dress ,-- show and finery are every thing . I have some notion of putting such a trimming as this to my white and silver poplin . Do you think it will look well ?"" The whole party were but just reassembled in the drawing - room when Mr . Weston made his appearance among them ."
austen#"He had returned to a late dinner , and walked to Hartfield as soon as it was over . He had been too much expected by the best judges , for surprize -- but there was great joy . Mr . Woodhouse was almost as glad to see him now , as he would have been sorry to see him before . John Knightley only was in mute astonishment .-- That a man who might have spent his evening quietly at home after a day of business in London , should set off again , and walk half a mile to another man ' s house , for the sake of being in mixed company till bed - time , of finishing his day in the efforts of civility and the noise of numbers , was a circumstance to strike him deeply . A man who had been in motion since eight o ' clock in the morning , and might now have been still , who had been long talking , and might have been silent , who had been in more than one crowd , and might have been alone !-- Such a man , to quit the tranquillity and independence of his own fireside , and on the evening of a cold sleety April day rush out again into the world !-- Could he by a touch of his finger have instantly taken back his wife , there would have been a motive ; but his coming would probably prolong rather than break up the party . John Knightley looked at him with amazement , then shrugged his shoulders , and said , "" I could not have believed it even of _him_ ."""
austen#"Mr . Weston meanwhile , perfectly unsuspicious of the indignation he was exciting , happy and cheerful as usual , and with all the right of being principal talker , which a day spent anywhere from home confers , was making himself agreeable among the rest ; and having satisfied the inquiries of his wife as to his dinner , convincing her that none of all her careful directions to the servants had been forgotten , and spread abroad what public news he had heard , was proceeding to a family communication , which , though principally addressed to Mrs . Weston , he had not the smallest doubt of being highly interesting to every body in the room . He gave her a letter , it was from Frank , and to herself ; he had met with it in his way , and had taken the liberty of opening it . "" Read it , read it ,"" said he , "" it will give you pleasure ; only a few lines -- will not take you long ; read it to Emma ."" The two ladies looked over it together ; and he sat smiling and talking to them the whole time , in a voice a little subdued , but very audible to every body . "" Well , he is coming , you see ; good news , I think . Well , what do you say to it ?-- I always told you he would be here again soon , did not I ?-- Anne , my dear , did not I always tell you so , and you would not believe me ?-- In town next week , you see -- at the latest , I dare say ; for _she_ is as impatient as the black gentleman when any thing is to be done ; most likely they will be there to - morrow or Saturday ."
austen#As to her illness , all nothing of course . But it is an excellent thing to have Frank among us again , so near as town . They will stay a good while when they do come , and he will be half his time with us . This is precisely what I wanted . Well , pretty good news , is not it ? Have you finished it ?
austen#"Has Emma read it all ? Put it up , put it up ; we will have a good talk about it some other time , but it will not do now . I shall only just mention the circumstance to the others in a common way ."" Mrs . Weston was most comfortably pleased on the occasion . Her looks and words had nothing to restrain them . She was happy , she knew she was happy , and knew she ought to be happy ."
austen#Her congratulations were warm and open ; but Emma could not speak so fluently . _She_ was a little occupied in weighing her own feelings , and trying to understand the degree of her agitation , which she rather thought was considerable . Mr . Weston , however , too eager to be very observant , too communicative to want others to talk , was very well satisfied with what she did say , and soon moved away to make the rest of his friends happy by a partial communication of what the whole room must have overheard already . It was well that he took every body ' s joy for granted , or he might not have thought either Mr . Woodhouse or Mr . Knightley particularly delighted . They were the first entitled , after Mrs . Weston and Emma , to be made happy ;-- from them he would have proceeded to Miss Fairfax , but she was so deep in conversation with John Knightley , that it would have been too positive an interruption ; and finding himself close to Mrs . Elton , and her attention disengaged , he necessarily began on the subject with her . CHAPTER XVIII
austen#""" I hope I shall soon have the pleasure of introducing my son to you ,"" said Mr . Weston . Mrs . Elton , very willing to suppose a particular compliment intended her by such a hope , smiled most graciously . "" You have heard of a certain Frank Churchill , I presume ,"" he continued -- "" and know him to be my son , though he does not bear my name ."" "" Oh ! yes , and I shall be very happy in his acquaintance . I am sure Mr . Elton will lose no time in calling on him ; and we shall both have great pleasure in seeing him at the Vicarage ."""
austen#""" You are very obliging .-- Frank will be extremely happy , I am sure .-- He is to be in town next week , if not sooner . We have notice of it in a letter to - day . I met the letters in my way this morning , and seeing my son ' s hand , presumed to open it -- though it was not directed to me -- it was to Mrs . Weston . She is his principal correspondent , I assure you . I hardly ever get a letter ."" "" And so you absolutely opened what was directed to her !"
austen#"Oh ! Mr . Weston -- ( laughing affectedly ) I must protest against that .-- A most dangerous precedent indeed !-- I beg you will not let your neighbours follow your example .-- Upon my word , if this is what I am to expect , we married women must begin to exert ourselves !-- Oh ! Mr . Weston , I could not have believed it of you !"" "" Aye , we men are sad fellows . You must take care of yourself , Mrs . Elton .-- This letter tells us -- it is a short letter -- written in a hurry , merely to give us notice -- it tells us that they are all coming up to town directly , on Mrs . Churchill ' s account -- she has not been well the whole winter , and thinks Enscombe too cold for her -- so they are all to move southward without loss of time ."""
austen#""" Indeed !-- from Yorkshire , I think . Enscombe is in Yorkshire ?"" "" Yes , they are about one hundred and ninety miles from London . a considerable journey ."" "" Yes , upon my word , very considerable . Sixty - five miles farther than from Maple Grove to London ."
austen#"But what is distance , Mr . Weston , to people of large fortune ?-- You would be amazed to hear how my brother , Mr . Suckling , sometimes flies about . You will hardly believe me -- but twice in one week he and Mr . Bragge went to London and back again with four horses ."" "" The evil of the distance from Enscombe ,"" said Mr . Weston , "" is , that Mrs . Churchill , _as_ _we_ _understand_ , has not been able to leave the sofa for a week together . In Frank ' s last letter she complained , he said , of being too weak to get into her conservatory without having both his arm and his uncle ' s ! This , you know , speaks a great degree of weakness -- but now she is so impatient to be in town , that she means to sleep only two nights on the road .-- So Frank writes word . Certainly , delicate ladies have very extraordinary constitutions , Mrs . Elton ."
austen#"You must grant me that ."" "" No , indeed , I shall grant you nothing . I Always take the part of my own sex . I do indeed . I give you notice -- You will find me a formidable antagonist on that point . I always stand up for women -- and I assure you , if you knew how Selina feels with respect to sleeping at an inn , you would not wonder at Mrs . Churchill ' s making incredible exertions to avoid it ."
austen#"Selina says it is quite horror to her -- and I believe I have caught a little of her nicety . She always travels with her own sheets ; an excellent precaution . Does Mrs . Churchill do the same ?"" "" Depend upon it , Mrs . Churchill does every thing that any other fine lady ever did . Mrs . Churchill will not be second to any lady in the land for ""-- Mrs . Elton eagerly interposed with ,"
austen#""" Oh ! Mr . Weston , do not mistake me . Selina is no fine lady , I assure you . Do not run away with such an idea ."" "" Is not she ? Then she is no rule for Mrs . Churchill , who is as thorough a fine lady as any body ever beheld ."""
austen#"Mrs . Elton began to think she had been wrong in disclaiming so warmly . It was by no means her object to have it believed that her sister was _not_ a fine lady ; perhaps there was want of spirit in the pretence of it ;-- and she was considering in what way she had best retract , when Mr . Weston went on . "" Mrs . Churchill is not much in my good graces , as you may suspect -- but this is quite between ourselves . She is very fond of Frank , and therefore I would not speak ill of her . Besides , she is out of health now ; but _that_ indeed , by her own account , she has always been . I would not say so to every body , Mrs . Elton , but I have not much faith in Mrs . Churchill ' s illness ."""
austen#""" If she is really ill , why not go to Bath , Mr . Weston ?-- To Bath , or to Clifton ?"" "" She has taken it into her head that Enscombe is too cold for her . The fact is , I suppose , that she is tired of Enscombe . She has now been a longer time stationary there , than she ever was before , and she begins to want change . It is a retired place ."
austen#"A fine place , but very retired ."" "" Aye -- like Maple Grove , I dare say . Nothing can stand more retired from the road than Maple Grove . Such an immense plantation all round it ! You seem shut out from every thing -- in the most complete retirement .-- And Mrs . Churchill probably has not health or spirits like Selina to enjoy that sort of seclusion . Or , perhaps she may not have resources enough in herself to be qualified for a country life ."
austen#"I always say a woman cannot have too many resources -- and I feel very thankful that I have so many myself as to be quite independent of society ."" "" Frank was here in February for a fortnight ."" "" So I remember to have heard . He will find an _addition_ to the society of Highbury when he comes again ; that is , if I may presume to call myself an addition . But perhaps he may never have heard of there being such a creature in the world ."" This was too loud a call for a compliment to be passed by , and Mr . Weston , with a very good grace , immediately exclaimed ,"
austen#""" My dear madam ! Nobody but yourself could imagine such a thing possible . Not heard of you !-- I believe Mrs . Weston ' s letters lately have been full of very little else than Mrs . Elton ."" He had done his duty and could return to his son . "" When Frank left us ,"" continued he , "" it was quite uncertain when we might see him again , which makes this day ' s news doubly welcome ."
austen#It has been completely unexpected . That is , _I_ always had a strong persuasion he would be here again soon , I was sure something favourable would turn up -- but nobody believed me . He and Mrs . Weston were both dreadfully desponding . ` How could he contrive to come ? And how could it be supposed that his uncle and aunt would spare him again ?' and so forth -- I always felt that something would happen in our favour ; and so it has , you see .
austen#"I have observed , Mrs . Elton , in the course of my life , that if things are going untowardly one month , they are sure to mend the next ."" "" Very true , Mr . Weston , perfectly true . It is just what I used to say to a certain gentleman in company in the days of courtship , when , because things did not go quite right , did not proceed with all the rapidity which suited his feelings , he was apt to be in despair , and exclaim that he was sure at this rate it would be _May_ before Hymen ' s saffron robe would be put on for us . Oh ! the pains I have been at to dispel those gloomy ideas and give him cheerfuller views ! The carriage -- we had disappointments about the carriage ;-- one morning , I remember , he came to me quite in despair ."""
austen#"She was stopped by a slight fit of coughing , and Mr . Weston instantly seized the opportunity of going on . "" You were mentioning May . May is the very month which Mrs . Churchill is ordered , or has ordered herself , to spend in some warmer place than Enscombe -- in short , to spend in London ; so that we have the agreeable prospect of frequent visits from Frank the whole spring -- precisely the season of the year which one should have chosen for it : days almost at the longest ; weather genial and pleasant , always inviting one out , and never too hot for exercise . When he was here before , we made the best of it ; but there was a good deal of wet , damp , cheerless weather ; there always is in February , you know , and we could not do half that we intended . Now will be the time . This will be complete enjoyment ; and I do not know , Mrs . Elton , whether the uncertainty of our meetings , the sort of constant expectation there will be of his coming in to - day or to - morrow , and at any hour , may not be more friendly to happiness than having him actually in the house ."
austen#"I think it is so . I think it is the state of mind which gives most spirit and delight . I hope you will be pleased with my son ; but you must not expect a prodigy . He is generally thought a fine young man , but do not expect a prodigy . Mrs . Weston ' s partiality for him is very great , and , as you may suppose , most gratifying to me . She thinks nobody equal to him ."""
austen#""" And I assure you , Mr . Weston , I have very little doubt that my opinion will be decidedly in his favour . I have heard so much in praise of Mr . Frank Churchill .-- At the same time it is fair to observe , that I am one of those who always judge for themselves , and are by no means implicitly guided by others . I give you notice that as I find your son , so I shall judge of him .-- I am no flatterer ."" Mr . Weston was musing . "" I hope ,"" said he presently , "" I have not been severe upon poor Mrs . Churchill . If she is ill I should be sorry to do her injustice ; but there are some traits in her character which make it difficult for me to speak of her with the forbearance I could wish ."
austen#"You cannot be ignorant , Mrs . Elton , of my connexion with the family , nor of the treatment I have met with ; and , between ourselves , the whole blame of it is to be laid to her . She was the instigator . Frank ' s mother would never have been slighted as she was but for her . Mr . Churchill has pride ; but his pride is nothing to his wife ' s : his is a quiet , indolent , gentlemanlike sort of pride that would harm nobody , and only make himself a little helpless and tiresome ; but her pride is arrogance and insolence ! And what inclines one less to bear , she has no fair pretence of family or blood . She was nobody when he married her , barely the daughter of a gentleman ; but ever since her being turned into a Churchill she has out - Churchill ' d them all in high and mighty claims : but in herself , I assure you , she is an upstart ."""
austen#""" Only think ! well , that must be infinitely provoking ! I have quite a horror of upstarts . Maple Grove has given me a thorough disgust to people of that sort ; for there is a family in that neighbourhood who are such an annoyance to my brother and sister from the airs they give themselves ! Your description of Mrs . Churchill made me think of them directly . People of the name of Tupman , very lately settled there , and encumbered with many low connexions , but giving themselves immense airs , and expecting to be on a footing with the old established families ."
austen#"A year and a half is the very utmost that they can have lived at West Hall ; and how they got their fortune nobody knows . They came from Birmingham , which is not a place to promise much , you know , Mr . Weston . One has not great hopes from Birmingham . I always say there is something direful in the sound : but nothing more is positively known of the Tupmans , though a good many things I assure you are suspected ; and yet by their manners they evidently think themselves equal even to my brother , Mr . Suckling , who happens to be one of their nearest neighbours . It is infinitely too bad . Mr . Suckling , who has been eleven years a resident at Maple Grove , and whose father had it before him -- I believe , at least -- I am almost sure that old Mr . Suckling had completed the purchase before his death ."""
austen#They were interrupted . Tea was carrying round , and Mr . Weston , having said all that he wanted , soon took the opportunity of walking away . After tea , Mr . and Mrs . Weston , and Mr . Elton sat down with Mr . Woodhouse to cards . The remaining five were left to their own powers , and Emma doubted their getting on very well ; for Mr . Knightley seemed little disposed for conversation ; Mrs . Elton was wanting notice , which nobody had inclination to pay , and she was herself in a worry of spirits which would have made her prefer being silent . Mr . John Knightley proved more talkative than his brother . He was to leave them early the next day ; and he soon began with --
austen#""" Well , Emma , I do not believe I have any thing more to say about the boys ; but you have your sister ' s letter , and every thing is down at full length there we may be sure . My charge would be much more concise than her ' s , and probably not much in the same spirit ; all that I have to recommend being comprised in , do not spoil them , and do not physic them ."" "" I rather hope to satisfy you both ,"" said Emma , "" for I shall do all in my power to make them happy , which will be enough for Isabella ; and happiness must preclude false indulgence and physic ."" "" And if you find them troublesome , you must send them home again ."" "" That is very likely . You think so , do not you ?"""
austen#""" I hope I am aware that they may be too noisy for your father -- or even may be some encumbrance to you , if your visiting engagements continue to increase as much as they have done lately ."" "" Increase !"" "" Certainly ; you must be sensible that the last half - year has made a great difference in your way of life ."" "" Difference ! No indeed I am not ."" "" There can be no doubt of your being much more engaged with company than you used to be ."
austen#"Witness this very time . Here am I come down for only one day , and you are engaged with a dinner - party !-- When did it happen before , or any thing like it ? Your neighbourhood is increasing , and you mix more with it . A little while ago , every letter to Isabella brought an account of fresh gaieties ; dinners at Mr . Cole ' s , or balls at the Crown . The difference which Randalls , Randalls alone makes in your goings - on , is very great ."" "" Yes ,"" said his brother quickly , "" it is Randalls that does it all ."""
austen#""" Very well -- and as Randalls , I suppose , is not likely to have less influence than heretofore , it strikes me as a possible thing , Emma , that Henry and John may be sometimes in the way . And if they are , I only beg you to send them home ."" "" No ,"" cried Mr . Knightley , "" that need not be the consequence . Let them be sent to Donwell . I shall certainly be at leisure ."" "" Upon my word ,"" exclaimed Emma , "" you amuse me !"
austen#"I should like to know how many of all my numerous engagements take place without your being of the party ; and why I am to be supposed in danger of wanting leisure to attend to the little boys . These amazing engagements of mine -- what have they been ? Dining once with the Coles -- and having a ball talked of , which never took place . I can understand you --( nodding at Mr . John Knightley )-- your good fortune in meeting with so many of your friends at once here , delights you too much to pass unnoticed . But you , ( turning to Mr . Knightley ,) who know how very , very seldom I am ever two hours from Hartfield , why you should foresee such a series of dissipation for me , I cannot imagine . And as to my dear little boys , I must say , that if Aunt Emma has not time for them , I do not think they would fare much better with Uncle Knightley , who is absent from home about five hours where she is absent one -- and who , when he is at home , is either reading to himself or settling his accounts ."""
austen#Mr . Knightley seemed to be trying not to smile ; and succeeded without difficulty , upon Mrs . Elton ' s beginning to talk to him . VOLUME III CHAPTER I A very little quiet reflection was enough to satisfy Emma as to the nature of her agitation on hearing this news of Frank Churchill . She was soon convinced that it was not for herself she was feeling at all apprehensive or embarrassed ; it was for him . Her own attachment had really subsided into a mere nothing ; it was not worth thinking of ;-- but if he , who had undoubtedly been always so much the most in love of the two , were to be returning with the same warmth of sentiment which he had taken away , it would be very distressing .
austen#If a separation of two months should not have cooled him , there were dangers and evils before her :-- caution for him and for herself would be necessary . She did not mean to have her own affections entangled again , and it would be incumbent on her to avoid any encouragement of his . She wished she might be able to keep him from an absolute declaration . That would be so very painful a conclusion of their present acquaintance ! and yet , she could not help rather anticipating something decisive . She felt as if the spring would not pass without bringing a crisis , an event , a something to alter her present composed and tranquil state .
austen#It was not very long , though rather longer than Mr . Weston had foreseen , before she had the power of forming some opinion of Frank Churchill ' s feelings . The Enscombe family were not in town quite so soon as had been imagined , but he was at Highbury very soon afterwards . He rode down for a couple of hours ; he could not yet do more ; but as he came from Randalls immediately to Hartfield , she could then exercise all her quick observation , and speedily determine how he was influenced , and how she must act . They met with the utmost friendliness . There could be no doubt of his great pleasure in seeing her . But she had an almost instant doubt of his caring for her as he had done , of his feeling the same tenderness in the same degree .
austen#She watched him well . It was a clear thing he was less in love than he had been . Absence , with the conviction probably of her indifference , had produced this very natural and very desirable effect . He was in high spirits ; as ready to talk and laugh as ever , and seemed delighted to speak of his former visit , and recur to old stories : and he was not without agitation . It was not in his calmness that she read his comparative difference . He was not calm ; his spirits were evidently fluttered ; there was restlessness about him .
austen#"Lively as he was , it seemed a liveliness that did not satisfy himself ; but what decided her belief on the subject , was his staying only a quarter of an hour , and hurrying away to make other calls in Highbury . "" He had seen a group of old acquaintance in the street as he passed -- he had not stopped , he would not stop for more than a word -- but he had the vanity to think they would be disappointed if he did not call , and much as he wished to stay longer at Hartfield , he must hurry off ."" She had no doubt as to his being less in love -- but neither his agitated spirits , nor his hurrying away , seemed like a perfect cure ; and she was rather inclined to think it implied a dread of her returning power , and a discreet resolution of not trusting himself with her long . This was the only visit from Frank Churchill in the course of ten days . He was often hoping , intending to come -- but was always prevented . His aunt could not bear to have him leave her ."
austen#Such was his own account at Randall ' s . If he were quite sincere , if he really tried to come , it was to be inferred that Mrs . Churchill ' s removal to London had been of no service to the wilful or nervous part of her disorder . That she was really ill was very certain ; he had declared himself convinced of it , at Randalls . Though much might be fancy , he could not doubt , when he looked back , that she was in a weaker state of health than she had been half a year ago . He did not believe it to proceed from any thing that care and medicine might not remove , or at least that she might not have many years of existence before her ; but he could not be prevailed on , by all his father ' s doubts , to say that her complaints were merely imaginary , or that she was as strong as ever . It soon appeared that London was not the place for her .
austen#She could not endure its noise . Her nerves were under continual irritation and suffering ; and by the ten days ' end , her nephew ' s letter to Randalls communicated a change of plan . They were going to remove immediately to Richmond . Mrs . Churchill had been recommended to the medical skill of an eminent person there , and had otherwise a fancy for the place . A ready - furnished house in a favourite spot was engaged , and much benefit expected from the change . Emma heard that Frank wrote in the highest spirits of this arrangement , and seemed most fully to appreciate the blessing of having two months before him of such near neighbourhood to many dear friends -- for the house was taken for May and June .
austen#She was told that now he wrote with the greatest confidence of being often with them , almost as often as he could even wish . Emma saw how Mr . Weston understood these joyous prospects . He was considering her as the source of all the happiness they offered . She hoped it was not so . Two months must bring it to the proof . Mr . Weston ' s own happiness was indisputable .
austen#He was quite delighted . It was the very circumstance he could have wished for . Now , it would be really having Frank in their neighbourhood . What were nine miles to a young man ?-- An hour ' s ride . He would be always coming over . The difference in that respect of Richmond and London was enough to make the whole difference of seeing him always and seeing him never .
austen#Sixteen miles -- nay , eighteen -- it must be full eighteen to Manchester - street -- was a serious obstacle . Were he ever able to get away , the day would be spent in coming and returning . There was no comfort in having him in London ; he might as well be at Enscombe ; but Richmond was the very distance for easy intercourse . Better than nearer ! One good thing was immediately brought to a certainty by this removal ,-- the ball at the Crown . It had not been forgotten before , but it had been soon acknowledged vain to attempt to fix a day .
austen#Now , however , it was absolutely to be ; every preparation was resumed , and very soon after the Churchills had removed to Richmond , a few lines from Frank , to say that his aunt felt already much better for the change , and that he had no doubt of being able to join them for twenty - four hours at any given time , induced them to name as early a day as possible . Mr . Weston ' s ball was to be a real thing . A very few to - morrows stood between the young people of Highbury and happiness . Mr . Woodhouse was resigned . The time of year lightened the evil to him . May was better for every thing than February .
austen#Mrs . Bates was engaged to spend the evening at Hartfield , James had due notice , and he sanguinely hoped that neither dear little Henry nor dear little John would have any thing the matter with them , while dear Emma were gone . CHAPTER II No misfortune occurred , again to prevent the ball . The day approached , the day arrived ; and after a morning of some anxious watching , Frank Churchill , in all the certainty of his own self , reached Randalls before dinner , and every thing was safe . No second meeting had there yet been between him and Emma . The room at the Crown was to witness it ;-- but it would be better than a common meeting in a crowd .
austen#"Mr . Weston had been so very earnest in his entreaties for her arriving there as soon as possible after themselves , for the purpose of taking her opinion as to the propriety and comfort of the rooms before any other persons came , that she could not refuse him , and must therefore spend some quiet interval in the young man ' s company . She was to convey Harriet , and they drove to the Crown in good time , the Randalls party just sufficiently before them . Frank Churchill seemed to have been on the watch ; and though he did not say much , his eyes declared that he meant to have a delightful evening . They all walked about together , to see that every thing was as it should be ; and within a few minutes were joined by the contents of another carriage , which Emma could not hear the sound of at first , without great surprize . "" So unreasonably early !"" she was going to exclaim ; but she presently found that it was a family of old friends , who were coming , like herself , by particular desire , to help Mr . Weston ' s judgment ; and they were so very closely followed by another carriage of cousins , who had been entreated to come early with the same distinguishing earnestness , on the same errand , that it seemed as if half the company might soon be collected together for the purpose of preparatory inspection ."
austen#Emma perceived that her taste was not the only taste on which Mr . Weston depended , and felt , that to be the favourite and intimate of a man who had so many intimates and confidantes , was not the very first distinction in the scale of vanity . She liked his open manners , but a little less of open - heartedness would have made him a higher character .-- General benevolence , but not general friendship , made a man what he ought to be .-- She could fancy such a man . The whole party walked about , and looked , and praised again ; and then , having nothing else to do , formed a sort of half - circle round the fire , to observe in their various modes , till other subjects were started , that , though _May_ , a fire in the evening was still very pleasant . Emma found that it was not Mr . Weston ' s fault that the number of privy councillors was not yet larger . They had stopped at Mrs . Bates ' s door to offer the use of their carriage , but the aunt and niece were to be brought by the Eltons . Frank was standing by her , but not steadily ; there was a restlessness , which shewed a mind not at ease .
austen#"He was looking about , he was going to the door , he was watching for the sound of other carriages ,-- impatient to begin , or afraid of being always near her . Mrs . Elton was spoken of . "" I think she must be here soon ,"" said he . "" I have a great curiosity to see Mrs . Elton , I have heard so much of her . It cannot be long , I think , before she comes ."" A carriage was heard ."
austen#"He was on the move immediately ; but coming back , said , "" I am forgetting that I am not acquainted with her . I have never seen either Mr . or Mrs . Elton . I have no business to put myself forward ."" Mr . and Mrs . Elton appeared ; and all the smiles and the proprieties passed . "" But Miss Bates and Miss Fairfax !"""
austen#"said Mr . Weston , looking about . "" We thought you were to bring them ."" The mistake had been slight . The carriage was sent for them now . Emma longed to know what Frank ' s first opinion of Mrs . Elton might be ; how he was affected by the studied elegance of her dress , and her smiles of graciousness . He was immediately qualifying himself to form an opinion , by giving her very proper attention , after the introduction had passed ."
austen#"In a few minutes the carriage returned .-- Somebody talked of rain .-- "" I will see that there are umbrellas , sir ,"" said Frank to his father : "" Miss Bates must not be forgotten :"" and away he went . Mr . Weston was following ; but Mrs . Elton detained him , to gratify him by her opinion of his son ; and so briskly did she begin , that the young man himself , though by no means moving slowly , could hardly be out of hearing . "" A very fine young man indeed , Mr . Weston . You know I candidly told you I should form my own opinion ; and I am happy to say that I am extremely pleased with him .-- You may believe me . I never compliment . I think him a very handsome young man , and his manners are precisely what I like and approve -- so truly the gentleman , without the least conceit or puppyism ."
austen#"You must know I have a vast dislike to puppies -- quite a horror of them . They were never tolerated at Maple Grove . Neither Mr . Suckling nor me had ever any patience with them ; and we used sometimes to say very cutting things ! Selina , who is mild almost to a fault , bore with them much better ."" While she talked of his son , Mr . Weston ' s attention was chained ; but when she got to Maple Grove , he could recollect that there were ladies just arriving to be attended to , and with happy smiles must hurry away . Mrs . Elton turned to Mrs . Weston ."
austen#""" I have no doubt of its being our carriage with Miss Bates and Jane . Our coachman and horses are so extremely expeditious !-- I believe we drive faster than any body .-- What a pleasure it is to send one ' s carriage for a friend !-- I understand you were so kind as to offer , but another time it will be quite unnecessary . You may be very sure I shall always take care of _them_ ."" Miss Bates and Miss Fairfax , escorted by the two gentlemen , walked into the room ; and Mrs . Elton seemed to think it as much her duty as Mrs . Weston ' s to receive them . Her gestures and movements might be understood by any one who looked on like Emma ; but her words , every body ' s words , were soon lost under the incessant flow of Miss Bates , who came in talking , and had not finished her speech under many minutes after her being admitted into the circle at the fire . As the door opened she was heard ,"
austen#""" So very obliging of you !-- No rain at all . Nothing to signify . I do not care for myself . Quite thick shoes . And Jane declares -- Well !--( as soon as she was within the door ) Well ! This is brilliant indeed !-- This is admirable !-- Excellently contrived , upon my word ."
austen#Nothing wanting . Could not have imagined it .-- So well lighted up !-- Jane , Jane , look !-- did you ever see any thing ? Oh ! Mr . Weston , you must really have had Aladdin ' s lamp . Good Mrs . Stokes would not know her own room again . I saw her as I came in ; she was standing in the entrance .
austen#"` Oh ! Mrs . Stokes ,' said I -- but I had not time for more ."" She was now met by Mrs . Weston .-- "" Very well , I thank you , ma ' am . I hope you are quite well . Very happy to hear it ."
austen#So afraid you might have a headache !-- seeing you pass by so often , and knowing how much trouble you must have . Delighted to hear it indeed . Ah ! dear Mrs . Elton , so obliged to you for the carriage !-- excellent time . Jane and I quite ready . Did not keep the horses a moment .
austen#Most comfortable carriage .-- Oh ! and I am sure our thanks are due to you , Mrs . Weston , on that score . Mrs . Elton had most kindly sent Jane a note , or we should have been .-- But two such offers in one day !-- Never were such neighbours . I said to my mother , ` Upon my word , ma ' am --.' Thank you , my mother is remarkably well . Gone to Mr . Woodhouse ' s .
austen#I made her take her shawl -- for the evenings are not warm -- her large new shawl -- Mrs . Dixon ' s wedding - present .-- So kind of her to think of my mother ! Bought at Weymouth , you know -- Mr . Dixon ' s choice . There were three others , Jane says , which they hesitated about some time . Colonel Campbell rather preferred an olive . My dear Jane , are you sure you did not wet your feet ?-- It was but a drop or two , but I am so afraid :-- but Mr . Frank Churchill was so extremely -- and there was a mat to step upon -- I shall never forget his extreme politeness .-- Oh ! Mr . Frank Churchill , I must tell you my mother ' s spectacles have never been in fault since ; the rivet never came out again .
austen#My mother often talks of your good - nature . Does not she , Jane ?-- Do not we often talk of Mr . Frank Churchill ?-- Ah ! here ' s Miss Woodhouse .-- Dear Miss Woodhouse , how do you do ?-- Very well I thank you , quite well . This is meeting quite in fairy - land !-- Such a transformation !-- Must not compliment , I know ( eyeing Emma most complacently )-- that would be rude -- but upon my word , Miss Woodhouse , you do look -- how do you like Jane ' s hair ?-- You are a judge .-- She did it all herself . Quite wonderful how she does her hair !-- No hairdresser from London I think could .-- Ah ! Dr . Hughes I declare -- and Mrs . Hughes .
austen#Must go and speak to Dr . and Mrs . Hughes for a moment .-- How do you do ? How do you do ?-- Very well , I thank you . This is delightful , is not it ?-- Where ' s dear Mr . Richard ?-- Oh ! there he is . Don ' t disturb him .
austen#Much better employed talking to the young ladies . How do you do , Mr . Richard ?-- I saw you the other day as you rode through the town -- Mrs . Otway , I protest !-- and good Mr . Otway , and Miss Otway and Miss Caroline .-- Such a host of friends !-- and Mr . George and Mr . Arthur !-- How do you do ? How do you all do ?-- Quite well , I am much obliged to you . Never better .-- Don ' t I hear another carriage ?-- Who can this be ?-- very likely the worthy Coles .-- Upon my word , this is charming to be standing about among such friends !
austen#"And such a noble fire !-- I am quite roasted . No coffee , I thank you , for me -- never take coffee .-- A little tea if you please , sir , by and bye ,-- no hurry -- Oh ! here it comes . Every thing so good !"" Frank Churchill returned to his station by Emma ; and as soon as Miss Bates was quiet , she found herself necessarily overhearing the discourse of Mrs . Elton and Miss Fairfax , who were standing a little way behind her .-- He was thoughtful . Whether he were overhearing too , she could not determine ."
austen#"After a good many compliments to Jane on her dress and look , compliments very quietly and properly taken , Mrs . Elton was evidently wanting to be complimented herself -- and it was , "" How do you like my gown ?-- How do you like my trimming ?-- How has Wright done my hair ?"" -- with many other relative questions , all answered with patient politeness . Mrs . Elton then said , "" Nobody can think less of dress in general than I do -- but upon such an occasion as this , when every body ' s eyes are so much upon me , and in compliment to the Westons -- who I have no doubt are giving this ball chiefly to do me honour -- I would not wish to be inferior to others . And I see very few pearls in the room except mine .-- So Frank Churchill is a capital dancer , I understand .-- We shall see if our styles suit .-- A fine young man certainly is Frank Churchill . I like him very well ."" At this moment Frank began talking so vigorously , that Emma could not but imagine he had overheard his own praises , and did not want to hear more ;-- and the voices of the ladies were drowned for a while , till another suspension brought Mrs . Elton ' s tones again distinctly forward .-- Mr ."
austen#"Elton had just joined them , and his wife was exclaiming , "" Oh ! you have found us out at last , have you , in our seclusion ?-- I was this moment telling Jane , I thought you would begin to be impatient for tidings of us ."" "" Jane !"" -- repeated Frank Churchill , with a look of surprize and displeasure .-- "" That is easy -- but Miss Fairfax does not disapprove it , I suppose ."" "" How do you like Mrs ."
austen#"Elton ?"" said Emma in a whisper . "" Not at all ."" "" You are ungrateful ."" "" Ungrateful !-- What do you mean ?"" Then changing from a frown to a smile --"" No , do not tell me -- I do not want to know what you mean .-- Where is my father ?-- When are we to begin dancing ?"""
austen#"Emma could hardly understand him ; he seemed in an odd humour . He walked off to find his father , but was quickly back again with both Mr . and Mrs . Weston . He had met with them in a little perplexity , which must be laid before Emma . It had just occurred to Mrs . Weston that Mrs . Elton must be asked to begin the ball ; that she would expect it ; which interfered with all their wishes of giving Emma that distinction .-- Emma heard the sad truth with fortitude . "" And what are we to do for a proper partner for her ?"" said Mr . Weston ."
austen#""" She will think Frank ought to ask her ."" Frank turned instantly to Emma , to claim her former promise ; and boasted himself an engaged man , which his father looked his most perfect approbation of -- and it then appeared that Mrs . Weston was wanting _him_ to dance with Mrs . Elton himself , and that their business was to help to persuade him into it , which was done pretty soon .-- Mr . Weston and Mrs . Elton led the way , Mr . Frank Churchill and Miss Woodhouse followed . Emma must submit to stand second to Mrs . Elton , though she had always considered the ball as peculiarly for her . It was almost enough to make her think of marrying . Mrs . Elton had undoubtedly the advantage , at this time , in vanity completely gratified ; for though she had intended to begin with Frank Churchill , she could not lose by the change . Mr . Weston might be his son ' s superior .-- In spite of this little rub , however , Emma was smiling with enjoyment , delighted to see the respectable length of the set as it was forming , and to feel that she had so many hours of unusual festivity before her .-- She was more disturbed by Mr . Knightley ' s not dancing than by any thing else .-- There he was , among the standers - by , where he ought not to be ; he ought to be dancing ,-- not classing himself with the husbands , and fathers , and whist - players , who were pretending to feel an interest in the dance till their rubbers were made up ,-- so young as he looked !-- He could not have appeared to greater advantage perhaps anywhere , than where he had placed himself ."
austen#His tall , firm , upright figure , among the bulky forms and stooping shoulders of the elderly men , was such as Emma felt must draw every body ' s eyes ; and , excepting her own partner , there was not one among the whole row of young men who could be compared with him .-- He moved a few steps nearer , and those few steps were enough to prove in how gentlemanlike a manner , with what natural grace , he must have danced , would he but take the trouble .-- Whenever she caught his eye , she forced him to smile ; but in general he was looking grave . She wished he could love a ballroom better , and could like Frank Churchill better .-- He seemed often observing her . She must not flatter herself that he thought of her dancing , but if he were criticising her behaviour , she did not feel afraid . There was nothing like flirtation between her and her partner . They seemed more like cheerful , easy friends , than lovers . That Frank Churchill thought less of her than he had done , was indubitable .
austen#The ball proceeded pleasantly . The anxious cares , the incessant attentions of Mrs . Weston , were not thrown away . Every body seemed happy ; and the praise of being a delightful ball , which is seldom bestowed till after a ball has ceased to be , was repeatedly given in the very beginning of the existence of this . Of very important , very recordable events , it was not more productive than such meetings usually are . There was one , however , which Emma thought something of .-- The two last dances before supper were begun , and Harriet had no partner ;-- the only young lady sitting down ;-- and so equal had been hitherto the number of dancers , that how there could be any one disengaged was the wonder !-- But Emma ' s wonder lessened soon afterwards , on seeing Mr . Elton sauntering about . He would not ask Harriet to dance if it were possible to be avoided : she was sure he would not -- and she was expecting him every moment to escape into the card - room .
austen#"Escape , however , was not his plan . He came to the part of the room where the sitters - by were collected , spoke to some , and walked about in front of them , as if to shew his liberty , and his resolution of maintaining it . He did not omit being sometimes directly before Miss Smith , or speaking to those who were close to her .-- Emma saw it . She was not yet dancing ; she was working her way up from the bottom , and had therefore leisure to look around , and by only turning her head a little she saw it all . When she was half - way up the set , the whole group were exactly behind her , and she would no longer allow her eyes to watch ; but Mr . Elton was so near , that she heard every syllable of a dialogue which just then took place between him and Mrs . Weston ; and she perceived that his wife , who was standing immediately above her , was not only listening also , but even encouraging him by significant glances .-- The kind - hearted , gentle Mrs . Weston had left her seat to join him and say , "" Do not you dance , Mr . Elton ?"""
austen#"to which his prompt reply was , "" Most readily , Mrs . Weston , if you will dance with me ."" "" Me !-- oh ! no -- I would get you a better partner than myself . I am no dancer ."" "" If Mrs . Gilbert wishes to dance ,"" said he , "" I shall have great pleasure , I am sure -- for , though beginning to feel myself rather an old married man , and that my dancing days are over , it would give me very great pleasure at any time to stand up with an old friend like Mrs . Gilbert ."""
austen#""" Mrs . Gilbert does not mean to dance , but there is a young lady disengaged whom I should be very glad to see dancing -- Miss Smith ."" "" Miss Smith !-- oh !-- I had not observed .-- You are extremely obliging -- and if I were not an old married man .-- But my dancing days are over , Mrs . Weston . You will excuse me . Any thing else I should be most happy to do , at your command -- but my dancing days are over ."" Mrs . Weston said no more ; and Emma could imagine with what surprize and mortification she must be returning to her seat . This was Mr . Elton !"
austen#the amiable , obliging , gentle Mr . Elton .-- She looked round for a moment ; he had joined Mr . Knightley at a little distance , and was arranging himself for settled conversation , while smiles of high glee passed between him and his wife . She would not look again . Her heart was in a glow , and she feared her face might be as hot . In another moment a happier sight caught her ;-- Mr . Knightley leading Harriet to the set !-- Never had she been more surprized , seldom more delighted , than at that instant . She was all pleasure and gratitude , both for Harriet and herself , and longed to be thanking him ; and though too distant for speech , her countenance said much , as soon as she could catch his eye again .
austen#"His dancing proved to be just what she had believed it , extremely good ; and Harriet would have seemed almost too lucky , if it had not been for the cruel state of things before , and for the very complete enjoyment and very high sense of the distinction which her happy features announced . It was not thrown away on her , she bounded higher than ever , flew farther down the middle , and was in a continual course of smiles . Mr . Elton had retreated into the card - room , looking ( Emma trusted ) very foolish . She did not think he was quite so hardened as his wife , though growing very like her ;-- _she_ spoke some of her feelings , by observing audibly to her partner , "" Knightley has taken pity on poor little Miss Smith !-- Very goodnatured , I declare ."" Supper was announced ."
austen#"The move began ; and Miss Bates might be heard from that moment , without interruption , till her being seated at table and taking up her spoon . "" Jane , Jane , my dear Jane , where are you ?-- Here is your tippet . Mrs . Weston begs you to put on your tippet . She says she is afraid there will be draughts in the passage , though every thing has been done -- One door nailed up -- Quantities of matting -- My dear Jane , indeed you must . Mr . Churchill , oh ! you are too obliging !"
austen#How well you put it on !-- so gratified ! Excellent dancing indeed !-- Yes , my dear , I ran home , as I said I should , to help grandmama to bed , and got back again , and nobody missed me .-- I set off without saying a word , just as I told you . Grandmama was quite well , had a charming evening with Mr . Woodhouse , a vast deal of chat , and backgammon .-- Tea was made downstairs , biscuits and baked apples and wine before she came away : amazing luck in some of her throws : and she inquired a great deal about you , how you were amused , and who were your partners . ` Oh !' said I , ` I shall not forestall Jane ; I left her dancing with Mr . George Otway ; she will love to tell you all about it herself to - morrow : her first partner was Mr . Elton , I do not know who will ask her next , perhaps Mr . William Cox .' My dear sir , you are too obliging .-- Is there nobody you would not rather ?-- I am not helpless .
austen#Sir , you are most kind . Upon my word , Jane on one arm , and me on the other !-- Stop , stop , let us stand a little back , Mrs . Elton is going ; dear Mrs . Elton , how elegant she looks !-- Beautiful lace !-- Now we all follow in her train . Quite the queen of the evening !-- Well , here we are at the passage . Two steps , Jane , take care of the two steps . Oh ! no , there is but one .
austen#Well , I was persuaded there were two . How very odd ! I was convinced there were two , and there is but one . I never saw any thing equal to the comfort and style -- Candles everywhere .-- I was telling you of your grandmama , Jane ,-- There was a little disappointment .-- The baked apples and biscuits , excellent in their way , you know ; but there was a delicate fricassee of sweetbread and some asparagus brought in at first , and good Mr . Woodhouse , not thinking the asparagus quite boiled enough , sent it all out again . Now there is nothing grandmama loves better than sweetbread and asparagus -- so she was rather disappointed , but we agreed we would not speak of it to any body , for fear of its getting round to dear Miss Woodhouse , who would be so very much concerned !-- Well , this is brilliant ! I am all amazement !
austen#could not have supposed any thing !-- Such elegance and profusion !-- I have seen nothing like it since -- Well , where shall we sit ? where shall we sit ? Anywhere , so that Jane is not in a draught . Where _I_ sit is of no consequence . Oh ! do you recommend this side ?-- Well , I am sure , Mr . Churchill -- only it seems too good -- but just as you please .
austen#"What you direct in this house cannot be wrong . Dear Jane , how shall we ever recollect half the dishes for grandmama ? Soup too ! Bless me ! I should not be helped so soon , but it smells most excellent , and I cannot help beginning ."" Emma had no opportunity of speaking to Mr . Knightley till after supper ; but , when they were all in the ballroom again , her eyes invited him irresistibly to come to her and be thanked ."
austen#"He was warm in his reprobation of Mr . Elton ' s conduct ; it had been unpardonable rudeness ; and Mrs . Elton ' s looks also received the due share of censure . "" They aimed at wounding more than Harriet ,"" said he . "" Emma , why is it that they are your enemies ?"" He looked with smiling penetration ; and , on receiving no answer , added , "" _She_ ought not to be angry with you , I suspect , whatever he may be .-- To that surmise , you say nothing , of course ; but confess , Emma , that you did want him to marry Harriet ."" "" I did ,"" replied Emma , "" and they cannot forgive me ."" He shook his head ; but there was a smile of indulgence with it , and he only said ,"
austen#""" I shall not scold you . I leave you to your own reflections ."" "" Can you trust me with such flatterers ?-- Does my vain spirit ever tell me I am wrong ?"" "" Not your vain spirit , but your serious spirit .-- If one leads you wrong , I am sure the other tells you of it ."" "" I do own myself to have been completely mistaken in Mr . Elton . There is a littleness about him which you discovered , and which I did not : and I was fully convinced of his being in love with Harriet ."
austen#"It was through a series of strange blunders !"" "" And , in return for your acknowledging so much , I will do you the justice to say , that you would have chosen for him better than he has chosen for himself .-- Harriet Smith has some first - rate qualities , which Mrs . Elton is totally without . An unpretending , single - minded , artless girl -- infinitely to be preferred by any man of sense and taste to such a woman as Mrs . Elton . I found Harriet more conversable than I expected ."" Emma was extremely gratified .-- They were interrupted by the bustle of Mr . Weston calling on every body to begin dancing again . "" Come Miss Woodhouse , Miss Otway , Miss Fairfax , what are you all doing ?-- Come Emma , set your companions the example ."
austen#"Every body is lazy ! Every body is asleep !"" "" I am ready ,"" said Emma , "" whenever I am wanted ."" "" Whom are you going to dance with ?"" asked Mr . Knightley . She hesitated a moment , and then replied , "" With you , if you will ask me ."""
austen#""" Will you ?"" said he , offering his hand . "" Indeed I will . You have shewn that you can dance , and you know we are not really so much brother and sister as to make it at all improper ."" "" Brother and sister ! no , indeed ."""
austen#CHAPTER III This little explanation with Mr . Knightley gave Emma considerable pleasure . It was one of the agreeable recollections of the ball , which she walked about the lawn the next morning to enjoy .-- She was extremely glad that they had come to so good an understanding respecting the Eltons , and that their opinions of both husband and wife were so much alike ; and his praise of Harriet , his concession in her favour , was peculiarly gratifying . The impertinence of the Eltons , which for a few minutes had threatened to ruin the rest of her evening , had been the occasion of some of its highest satisfactions ; and she looked forward to another happy result -- the cure of Harriet ' s infatuation .-- From Harriet ' s manner of speaking of the circumstance before they quitted the ballroom , she had strong hopes . It seemed as if her eyes were suddenly opened , and she were enabled to see that Mr . Elton was not the superior creature she had believed him . The fever was over , and Emma could harbour little fear of the pulse being quickened again by injurious courtesy .
austen#She depended on the evil feelings of the Eltons for supplying all the discipline of pointed neglect that could be farther requisite .-- Harriet rational , Frank Churchill not too much in love , and Mr . Knightley not wanting to quarrel with her , how very happy a summer must be before her ! She was not to see Frank Churchill this morning . He had told her that he could not allow himself the pleasure of stopping at Hartfield , as he was to be at home by the middle of the day . She did not regret it . Having arranged all these matters , looked them through , and put them all to rights , she was just turning to the house with spirits freshened up for the demands of the two little boys , as well as of their grandpapa , when the great iron sweep - gate opened , and two persons entered whom she had never less expected to see together -- Frank Churchill , with Harriet leaning on his arm -- actually Harriet !-- A moment sufficed to convince her that something extraordinary had happened . Harriet looked white and frightened , and he was trying to cheer her .-- The iron gates and the front - door were not twenty yards asunder ;-- they were all three soon in the hall , and Harriet immediately sinking into a chair fainted away .
austen#A young lady who faints , must be recovered ; questions must be answered , and surprizes be explained . Such events are very interesting , but the suspense of them cannot last long . A few minutes made Emma acquainted with the whole . Miss Smith , and Miss Bickerton , another parlour boarder at Mrs . Goddard ' s , who had been also at the ball , had walked out together , and taken a road , the Richmond road , which , though apparently public enough for safety , had led them into alarm .-- About half a mile beyond Highbury , making a sudden turn , and deeply shaded by elms on each side , it became for a considerable stretch very retired ; and when the young ladies had advanced some way into it , they had suddenly perceived at a small distance before them , on a broader patch of greensward by the side , a party of gipsies . A child on the watch , came towards them to beg ; and Miss Bickerton , excessively frightened , gave a great scream , and calling on Harriet to follow her , ran up a steep bank , cleared a slight hedge at the top , and made the best of her way by a short cut back to Highbury . But poor Harriet could not follow .
austen#She had suffered very much from cramp after dancing , and her first attempt to mount the bank brought on such a return of it as made her absolutely powerless -- and in this state , and exceedingly terrified , she had been obliged to remain . How the trampers might have behaved , had the young ladies been more courageous , must be doubtful ; but such an invitation for attack could not be resisted ; and Harriet was soon assailed by half a dozen children , headed by a stout woman and a great boy , all clamorous , and impertinent in look , though not absolutely in word .-- More and more frightened , she immediately promised them money , and taking out her purse , gave them a shilling , and begged them not to want more , or to use her ill .-- She was then able to walk , though but slowly , and was moving away -- but her terror and her purse were too tempting , and she was followed , or rather surrounded , by the whole gang , demanding more . In this state Frank Churchill had found her , she trembling and conditioning , they loud and insolent . By a most fortunate chance his leaving Highbury had been delayed so as to bring him to her assistance at this critical moment . The pleasantness of the morning had induced him to walk forward , and leave his horses to meet him by another road , a mile or two beyond Highbury -- and happening to have borrowed a pair of scissors the night before of Miss Bates , and to have forgotten to restore them , he had been obliged to stop at her door , and go in for a few minutes : he was therefore later than he had intended ; and being on foot , was unseen by the whole party till almost close to them . The terror which the woman and boy had been creating in Harriet was then their own portion .
austen#He had left them completely frightened ; and Harriet eagerly clinging to him , and hardly able to speak , had just strength enough to reach Hartfield , before her spirits were quite overcome . It was his idea to bring her to Hartfield : he had thought of no other place . This was the amount of the whole story ,-- of his communication and of Harriet ' s as soon as she had recovered her senses and speech .-- He dared not stay longer than to see her well ; these several delays left him not another minute to lose ; and Emma engaging to give assurance of her safety to Mrs . Goddard , and notice of there being such a set of people in the neighbourhood to Mr . Knightley , he set off , with all the grateful blessings that she could utter for her friend and herself . Such an adventure as this ,-- a fine young man and a lovely young woman thrown together in such a way , could hardly fail of suggesting certain ideas to the coldest heart and the steadiest brain . So Emma thought , at least . Could a linguist , could a grammarian , could even a mathematician have seen what she did , have witnessed their appearance together , and heard their history of it , without feeling that circumstances had been at work to make them peculiarly interesting to each other ?-- How much more must an imaginist , like herself , be on fire with speculation and foresight !-- especially with such a groundwork of anticipation as her mind had already made .
austen#It was a very extraordinary thing ! Nothing of the sort had ever occurred before to any young ladies in the place , within her memory ; no rencontre , no alarm of the kind ;-- and now it had happened to the very person , and at the very hour , when the other very person was chancing to pass by to rescue her !-- It certainly was very extraordinary !-- And knowing , as she did , the favourable state of mind of each at this period , it struck her the more . He was wishing to get the better of his attachment to herself , she just recovering from her mania for Mr . Elton . It seemed as if every thing united to promise the most interesting consequences . It was not possible that the occurrence should not be strongly recommending each to the other . In the few minutes ' conversation which she had yet had with him , while Harriet had been partially insensible , he had spoken of her terror , her naivete , her fervour as she seized and clung to his arm , with a sensibility amused and delighted ; and just at last , after Harriet ' s own account had been given , he had expressed his indignation at the abominable folly of Miss Bickerton in the warmest terms .
austen#Every thing was to take its natural course , however , neither impelled nor assisted . She would not stir a step , nor drop a hint . No , she had had enough of interference . There could be no harm in a scheme , a mere passive scheme . It was no more than a wish . Beyond it she would on no account proceed .
austen#Emma ' s first resolution was to keep her father from the knowledge of what had passed ,-- aware of the anxiety and alarm it would occasion : but she soon felt that concealment must be impossible . Within half an hour it was known all over Highbury . It was the very event to engage those who talk most , the young and the low ; and all the youth and servants in the place were soon in the happiness of frightful news . The last night ' s ball seemed lost in the gipsies . Poor Mr . Woodhouse trembled as he sat , and , as Emma had foreseen , would scarcely be satisfied without their promising never to go beyond the shrubbery again . It was some comfort to him that many inquiries after himself and Miss Woodhouse ( for his neighbours knew that he loved to be inquired after ), as well as Miss Smith , were coming in during the rest of the day ; and he had the pleasure of returning for answer , that they were all very indifferent -- which , though not exactly true , for she was perfectly well , and Harriet not much otherwise , Emma would not interfere with .
austen#"She had an unhappy state of health in general for the child of such a man , for she hardly knew what indisposition was ; and if he did not invent illnesses for her , she could make no figure in a message . The gipsies did not wait for the operations of justice ; they took themselves off in a hurry . The young ladies of Highbury might have walked again in safety before their panic began , and the whole history dwindled soon into a matter of little importance but to Emma and her nephews :-- in her imagination it maintained its ground , and Henry and John were still asking every day for the story of Harriet and the gipsies , and still tenaciously setting her right if she varied in the slightest particular from the original recital . CHAPTER IV A very few days had passed after this adventure , when Harriet came one morning to Emma with a small parcel in her hand , and after sitting down and hesitating , thus began : "" Miss Woodhouse -- if you are at leisure -- I have something that I should like to tell you -- a sort of confession to make -- and then , you know , it will be over ."""
austen#"Emma was a good deal surprized ; but begged her to speak . There was a seriousness in Harriet ' s manner which prepared her , quite as much as her words , for something more than ordinary . "" It is my duty , and I am sure it is my wish ,"" she continued , "" to have no reserves with you on this subject . As I am happily quite an altered creature in _one_ _respect_ , it is very fit that you should have the satisfaction of knowing it . I do not want to say more than is necessary -- I am too much ashamed of having given way as I have done , and I dare say you understand me ."" "" Yes ,"" said Emma , "" I hope I do ."""
austen#""" How I could so long a time be fancying myself ! . . ."" cried Harriet , warmly . "" It seems like madness !"
austen#"I can see nothing at all extraordinary in him now .-- I do not care whether I meet him or not -- except that of the two I had rather not see him -- and indeed I would go any distance round to avoid him -- but I do not envy his wife in the least ; I neither admire her nor envy her , as I have done : she is very charming , I dare say , and all that , but I think her very ill - tempered and disagreeable -- I shall never forget her look the other night !-- However , I assure you , Miss Woodhouse , I wish her no evil .-- No , let them be ever so happy together , it will not give me another moment ' s pang : and to convince you that I have been speaking truth , I am now going to destroy -- what I ought to have destroyed long ago -- what I ought never to have kept -- I know that very well ( blushing as she spoke ).-- However , now I will destroy it all -- and it is my particular wish to do it in your presence , that you may see how rational I am grown . Cannot you guess what this parcel holds ?"" said she , with a conscious look . "" Not the least in the world .-- Did he ever give you any thing ?"" "" No -- I cannot call them gifts ; but they are things that I have valued very much ."" She held the parcel towards her , and Emma read the words _Most_ _precious_ _treasures_ on the top ."
austen#"Her curiosity was greatly excited . Harriet unfolded the parcel , and she looked on with impatience . Within abundance of silver paper was a pretty little Tunbridge - ware box , which Harriet opened : it was well lined with the softest cotton ; but , excepting the cotton , Emma saw only a small piece of court - plaister . "" Now ,"" said Harriet , "" you _must_ recollect ."" "" No , indeed I do not ."" "" Dear me !"
austen#"I should not have thought it possible you could forget what passed in this very room about court - plaister , one of the very last times we ever met in it !-- It was but a very few days before I had my sore throat -- just before Mr . and Mrs . John Knightley came -- I think the very evening .-- Do not you remember his cutting his finger with your new penknife , and your recommending court - plaister ?-- But , as you had none about you , and knew I had , you desired me to supply him ; and so I took mine out and cut him a piece ; but it was a great deal too large , and he cut it smaller , and kept playing some time with what was left , before he gave it back to me . And so then , in my nonsense , I could not help making a treasure of it -- so I put it by never to be used , and looked at it now and then as a great treat ."" "" My dearest Harriet !"" cried Emma , putting her hand before her face , and jumping up , "" you make me more ashamed of myself than I can bear . Remember it ? Aye , I remember it all now ; all , except your saving this relic -- I knew nothing of that till this moment -- but the cutting the finger , and my recommending court - plaister , and saying I had none about me !-- Oh !"
austen#"my sins , my sins !-- And I had plenty all the while in my pocket !-- One of my senseless tricks !-- I deserve to be under a continual blush all the rest of my life .-- Well --( sitting down again )-- go on -- what else ?"" "" And had you really some at hand yourself ? I am sure I never suspected it , you did it so naturally ."" "" And so you actually put this piece of court - plaister by for his sake !"" said Emma , recovering from her state of shame and feeling divided between wonder and amusement . And secretly she added to herself , "" Lord bless me !"
austen#"when should I ever have thought of putting by in cotton a piece of court - plaister that Frank Churchill had been pulling about ! I never was equal to this ."" "" Here ,"" resumed Harriet , turning to her box again , "" here is something still more valuable , I mean that _has_ _been_ more valuable , because this is what did really once belong to him , which the court - plaister never did ."" Emma was quite eager to see this superior treasure . It was the end of an old pencil ,-- the part without any lead . "" This was really his ,"" said Harriet .--"" Do not you remember one morning ?-- no , I dare say you do not ."
austen#"But one morning -- I forget exactly the day -- but perhaps it was the Tuesday or Wednesday before _that_ _evening_ , he wanted to make a memorandum in his pocket - book ; it was about spruce - beer . Mr . Knightley had been telling him something about brewing spruce - beer , and he wanted to put it down ; but when he took out his pencil , there was so little lead that he soon cut it all away , and it would not do , so you lent him another , and this was left upon the table as good for nothing . But I kept my eye on it ; and , as soon as I dared , caught it up , and never parted with it again from that moment ."" "" I do remember it ,"" cried Emma ; "" I perfectly remember it .-- Talking about spruce - beer .-- Oh ! yes -- Mr . Knightley and I both saying we liked it , and Mr . Elton ' s seeming resolved to learn to like it too . I perfectly remember it .-- Stop ; Mr . Knightley was standing just here , was not he ?"
austen#"I have an idea he was standing just here ."" "" Ah ! I do not know . I cannot recollect .-- It is very odd , but I cannot recollect .-- Mr . Elton was sitting here , I remember , much about where I am now ."" --"
austen#""" Well , go on ."" "" Oh ! that ' s all . I have nothing more to shew you , or to say -- except that I am now going to throw them both behind the fire , and I wish you to see me do it ."" "" My poor dear Harriet ! and have you actually found happiness in treasuring up these things ?"""
austen#""" Yes , simpleton as I was !-- but I am quite ashamed of it now , and wish I could forget as easily as I can burn them . It was very wrong of me , you know , to keep any remembrances , after he was married . I knew it was -- but had not resolution enough to part with them ."" "" But , Harriet , is it necessary to burn the court - plaister ?-- I have not a word to say for the bit of old pencil , but the court - plaister might be useful ."" "" I shall be happier to burn it ,"" replied Harriet . "" It has a disagreeable look to me ."
austen#"I must get rid of every thing .-- There it goes , and there is an end , thank Heaven ! of Mr . Elton ."" "" And when ,"" thought Emma , "" will there be a beginning of Mr . Churchill ?"" She had soon afterwards reason to believe that the beginning was already made , and could not but hope that the gipsy , though she had _told_ no fortune , might be proved to have made Harriet ' s .-- About a fortnight after the alarm , they came to a sufficient explanation , and quite undesignedly ."
austen#"Emma was not thinking of it at the moment , which made the information she received more valuable . She merely said , in the course of some trivial chat , "" Well , Harriet , whenever you marry I would advise you to do so and so ""-- and thought no more of it , till after a minute ' s silence she heard Harriet say in a very serious tone , "" I shall never marry ."" Emma then looked up , and immediately saw how it was ; and after a moment ' s debate , as to whether it should pass unnoticed or not , replied , "" Never marry !-- This is a new resolution ."" "" It is one that I shall never change , however ."" After another short hesitation , "" I hope it does not proceed from -- I hope it is not in compliment to Mr ."
austen#"Elton ?"" "" Mr . Elton indeed !"" cried Harriet indignantly .--"" Oh ! no ""-- and Emma could just catch the words , "" so superior to Mr . Elton !"" She then took a longer time for consideration ."
austen#"Should she proceed no farther ?-- should she let it pass , and seem to suspect nothing ?-- Perhaps Harriet might think her cold or angry if she did ; or perhaps if she were totally silent , it might only drive Harriet into asking her to hear too much ; and against any thing like such an unreserve as had been , such an open and frequent discussion of hopes and chances , she was perfectly resolved .-- She believed it would be wiser for her to say and know at once , all that she meant to say and know . Plain dealing was always best . She had previously determined how far she would proceed , on any application of the sort ; and it would be safer for both , to have the judicious law of her own brain laid down with speed .-- She was decided , and thus spoke -- "" Harriet , I will not affect to be in doubt of your meaning . Your resolution , or rather your expectation of never marrying , results from an idea that the person whom you might prefer , would be too greatly your superior in situation to think of you . Is not it so ?"""
austen#""" Oh ! Miss Woodhouse , believe me I have not the presumption to suppose -- Indeed I am not so mad .-- But it is a pleasure to me to admire him at a distance -- and to think of his infinite superiority to all the rest of the world , with the gratitude , wonder , and veneration , which are so proper , in me especially ."" "" I am not at all surprized at you , Harriet . The service he rendered you was enough to warm your heart ."" "" Service ! oh !"
austen#"it was such an inexpressible obligation !-- The very recollection of it , and all that I felt at the time -- when I saw him coming -- his noble look -- and my wretchedness before . Such a change ! In one moment such a change ! From perfect misery to perfect happiness !"" "" It is very natural . It is natural , and it is honourable .-- Yes , honourable , I think , to chuse so well and so gratefully .-- But that it will be a fortunate preference is more that I can promise ."
austen#I do not advise you to give way to it , Harriet . I do not by any means engage for its being returned . Consider what you are about . Perhaps it will be wisest in you to check your feelings while you can : at any rate do not let them carry you far , unless you are persuaded of his liking you . Be observant of him . Let his behaviour be the guide of your sensations .
austen#I give you this caution now , because I shall never speak to you again on the subject . I am determined against all interference . Henceforward I know nothing of the matter . Let no name ever pass our lips . We were very wrong before ; we will be cautious now .-- He is your superior , no doubt , and there do seem objections and obstacles of a very serious nature ; but yet , Harriet , more wonderful things have taken place , there have been matches of greater disparity . But take care of yourself .
austen#"I would not have you too sanguine ; though , however it may end , be assured your raising your thoughts to _him_ , is a mark of good taste which I shall always know how to value ."" Harriet kissed her hand in silent and submissive gratitude . Emma was very decided in thinking such an attachment no bad thing for her friend . Its tendency would be to raise and refine her mind -- and it must be saving her from the danger of degradation . CHAPTER V In this state of schemes , and hopes , and connivance , June opened upon Hartfield ."
austen#To Highbury in general it brought no material change . The Eltons were still talking of a visit from the Sucklings , and of the use to be made of their barouche - landau ; and Jane Fairfax was still at her grandmother ' s ; and as the return of the Campbells from Ireland was again delayed , and August , instead of Midsummer , fixed for it , she was likely to remain there full two months longer , provided at least she were able to defeat Mrs . Elton ' s activity in her service , and save herself from being hurried into a delightful situation against her will . Mr . Knightley , who , for some reason best known to himself , had certainly taken an early dislike to Frank Churchill , was only growing to dislike him more . He began to suspect him of some double dealing in his pursuit of Emma . That Emma was his object appeared indisputable . Every thing declared it ; his own attentions , his father ' s hints , his mother - in - law ' s guarded silence ; it was all in unison ; words , conduct , discretion , and indiscretion , told the same story .
austen#"But while so many were devoting him to Emma , and Emma herself making him over to Harriet , Mr . Knightley began to suspect him of some inclination to trifle with Jane Fairfax . He could not understand it ; but there were symptoms of intelligence between them -- he thought so at least -- symptoms of admiration on his side , which , having once observed , he could not persuade himself to think entirely void of meaning , however he might wish to escape any of Emma ' s errors of imagination . _She_ was not present when the suspicion first arose . He was dining with the Randalls family , and Jane , at the Eltons '; and he had seen a look , more than a single look , at Miss Fairfax , which , from the admirer of Miss Woodhouse , seemed somewhat out of place . When he was again in their company , he could not help remembering what he had seen ; nor could he avoid observations which , unless it were like Cowper and his fire at twilight , "" Myself creating what I saw ,"""
austen#brought him yet stronger suspicion of there being a something of private liking , of private understanding even , between Frank Churchill and Jane . He had walked up one day after dinner , as he very often did , to spend his evening at Hartfield . Emma and Harriet were going to walk ; he joined them ; and , on returning , they fell in with a larger party , who , like themselves , judged it wisest to take their exercise early , as the weather threatened rain ; Mr . and Mrs . Weston and their son , Miss Bates and her niece , who had accidentally met . They all united ; and , on reaching Hartfield gates , Emma , who knew it was exactly the sort of visiting that would be welcome to her father , pressed them all to go in and drink tea with him . The Randalls party agreed to it immediately ; and after a pretty long speech from Miss Bates , which few persons listened to , she also found it possible to accept dear Miss Woodhouse ' s most obliging invitation . As they were turning into the grounds , Mr . Perry passed by on horseback .
austen#"The gentlemen spoke of his horse . "" By the bye ,"" said Frank Churchill to Mrs . Weston presently , "" what became of Mr . Perry ' s plan of setting up his carriage ?"" Mrs . Weston looked surprized , and said , "" I did not know that he ever had any such plan ."" "" Nay , I had it from you . You wrote me word of it three months ago ."" "" Me !"
austen#"impossible !"" "" Indeed you did . I remember it perfectly . You mentioned it as what was certainly to be very soon . Mrs . Perry had told somebody , and was extremely happy about it . It was owing to _her_ persuasion , as she thought his being out in bad weather did him a great deal of harm ."
austen#"You must remember it now ?"" "" Upon my word I never heard of it till this moment ."" "" Never ! really , never !-- Bless me ! how could it be ?-- Then I must have dreamt it -- but I was completely persuaded -- Miss Smith , you walk as if you were tired . You will not be sorry to find yourself at home ."""
austen#""" What is this ?-- What is this ?"" cried Mr . Weston , "" about Perry and a carriage ? Is Perry going to set up his carriage , Frank ? I am glad he can afford it . You had it from himself , had you ?"" "" No , sir ,"" replied his son , laughing , "" I seem to have had it from nobody .-- Very odd !-- I really was persuaded of Mrs . Weston ' s having mentioned it in one of her letters to Enscombe , many weeks ago , with all these particulars -- but as she declares she never heard a syllable of it before , of course it must have been a dream ."
austen#"I am a great dreamer . I dream of every body at Highbury when I am away -- and when I have gone through my particular friends , then I begin dreaming of Mr . and Mrs . Perry ."" "" It is odd though ,"" observed his father , "" that you should have had such a regular connected dream about people whom it was not very likely you should be thinking of at Enscombe . Perry ' s setting up his carriage ! and his wife ' s persuading him to it , out of care for his health -- just what will happen , I have no doubt , some time or other ; only a little premature ."
austen#"What an air of probability sometimes runs through a dream ! And at others , what a heap of absurdities it is ! Well , Frank , your dream certainly shews that Highbury is in your thoughts when you are absent . Emma , you are a great dreamer , I think ?"" Emma was out of hearing . She had hurried on before her guests to prepare her father for their appearance , and was beyond the reach of Mr . Weston ' s hint ."
austen#""" Why , to own the truth ,"" cried Miss Bates , who had been trying in vain to be heard the last two minutes , "" if I must speak on this subject , there is no denying that Mr . Frank Churchill might have -- I do not mean to say that he did not dream it -- I am sure I have sometimes the oddest dreams in the world -- but if I am questioned about it , I must acknowledge that there was such an idea last spring ; for Mrs . Perry herself mentioned it to my mother , and the Coles knew of it as well as ourselves -- but it was quite a secret , known to nobody else , and only thought of about three days . Mrs . Perry was very anxious that he should have a carriage , and came to my mother in great spirits one morning because she thought she had prevailed . Jane , don ' t you remember grandmama ' s telling us of it when we got home ? I forget where we had been walking to -- very likely to Randalls ; yes , I think it was to Randalls . Mrs . Perry was always particularly fond of my mother -- indeed I do not know who is not -- and she had mentioned it to her in confidence ; she had no objection to her telling us , of course , but it was not to go beyond : and , from that day to this , I never mentioned it to a soul that I know of . At the same time , I will not positively answer for my having never dropt a hint , because I know I do sometimes pop out a thing before I am aware ."
austen#"I am a talker , you know ; I am rather a talker ; and now and then I have let a thing escape me which I should not . I am not like Jane ; I wish I were . I will answer for it _she_ never betrayed the least thing in the world . Where is she ?-- Oh ! just behind . Perfectly remember Mrs . Perry ' s coming .-- Extraordinary dream , indeed !"""
austen#They were entering the hall . Mr . Knightley ' s eyes had preceded Miss Bates ' s in a glance at Jane . From Frank Churchill ' s face , where he thought he saw confusion suppressed or laughed away , he had involuntarily turned to hers ; but she was indeed behind , and too busy with her shawl . Mr . Weston had walked in . The two other gentlemen waited at the door to let her pass . Mr . Knightley suspected in Frank Churchill the determination of catching her eye -- he seemed watching her intently -- in vain , however , if it were so -- Jane passed between them into the hall , and looked at neither .
austen#"There was no time for farther remark or explanation . The dream must be borne with , and Mr . Knightley must take his seat with the rest round the large modern circular table which Emma had introduced at Hartfield , and which none but Emma could have had power to place there and persuade her father to use , instead of the small - sized Pembroke , on which two of his daily meals had , for forty years been crowded . Tea passed pleasantly , and nobody seemed in a hurry to move . "" Miss Woodhouse ,"" said Frank Churchill , after examining a table behind him , which he could reach as he sat , "" have your nephews taken away their alphabets -- their box of letters ? It used to stand here . Where is it ?"
austen#"This is a sort of dull - looking evening , that ought to be treated rather as winter than summer . We had great amusement with those letters one morning . I want to puzzle you again ."" Emma was pleased with the thought ; and producing the box , the table was quickly scattered over with alphabets , which no one seemed so much disposed to employ as their two selves . They were rapidly forming words for each other , or for any body else who would be puzzled . The quietness of the game made it particularly eligible for Mr . Woodhouse , who had often been distressed by the more animated sort , which Mr . Weston had occasionally introduced , and who now sat happily occupied in lamenting , with tender melancholy , over the departure of the "" poor little boys ,"" or in fondly pointing out , as he took up any stray letter near him , how beautifully Emma had written it ."
austen#Frank Churchill placed a word before Miss Fairfax . She gave a slight glance round the table , and applied herself to it . Frank was next to Emma , Jane opposite to them -- and Mr . Knightley so placed as to see them all ; and it was his object to see as much as he could , with as little apparent observation . The word was discovered , and with a faint smile pushed away . If meant to be immediately mixed with the others , and buried from sight , she should have looked on the table instead of looking just across , for it was not mixed ; and Harriet , eager after every fresh word , and finding out none , directly took it up , and fell to work . She was sitting by Mr . Knightley , and turned to him for help .
austen#The word was _blunder_ ; and as Harriet exultingly proclaimed it , there was a blush on Jane ' s cheek which gave it a meaning not otherwise ostensible . Mr . Knightley connected it with the dream ; but how it could all be , was beyond his comprehension . How the delicacy , the discretion of his favourite could have been so lain asleep ! He feared there must be some decided involvement . Disingenuousness and double dealing seemed to meet him at every turn . These letters were but the vehicle for gallantry and trick .
austen#"It was a child ' s play , chosen to conceal a deeper game on Frank Churchill ' s part . With great indignation did he continue to observe him ; with great alarm and distrust , to observe also his two blinded companions . He saw a short word prepared for Emma , and given to her with a look sly and demure . He saw that Emma had soon made it out , and found it highly entertaining , though it was something which she judged it proper to appear to censure ; for she said , "" Nonsense ! for shame !"" He heard Frank Churchill next say , with a glance towards Jane , "" I will give it to her -- shall I ?"""
austen#"-- and as clearly heard Emma opposing it with eager laughing warmth . "" No , no , you must not ; you shall not , indeed ."" It was done however . This gallant young man , who seemed to love without feeling , and to recommend himself without complaisance , directly handed over the word to Miss Fairfax , and with a particular degree of sedate civility entreated her to study it . Mr . Knightley ' s excessive curiosity to know what this word might be , made him seize every possible moment for darting his eye towards it , and it was not long before he saw it to be _Dixon_ . Jane Fairfax ' s perception seemed to accompany his ; her comprehension was certainly more equal to the covert meaning , the superior intelligence , of those five letters so arranged ."
austen#"She was evidently displeased ; looked up , and seeing herself watched , blushed more deeply than he had ever perceived her , and saying only , "" I did not know that proper names were allowed ,"" pushed away the letters with even an angry spirit , and looked resolved to be engaged by no other word that could be offered . Her face was averted from those who had made the attack , and turned towards her aunt . "" Aye , very true , my dear ,"" cried the latter , though Jane had not spoken a word --"" I was just going to say the same thing . It is time for us to be going indeed . The evening is closing in , and grandmama will be looking for us . My dear sir , you are too obliging ."
austen#"We really must wish you good night ."" Jane ' s alertness in moving , proved her as ready as her aunt had preconceived . She was immediately up , and wanting to quit the table ; but so many were also moving , that she could not get away ; and Mr . Knightley thought he saw another collection of letters anxiously pushed towards her , and resolutely swept away by her unexamined . She was afterwards looking for her shawl -- Frank Churchill was looking also -- it was growing dusk , and the room was in confusion ; and how they parted , Mr . Knightley could not tell . He remained at Hartfield after all the rest , his thoughts full of what he had seen ; so full , that when the candles came to assist his observations , he must -- yes , he certainly must , as a friend -- an anxious friend -- give Emma some hint , ask her some question . He could not see her in a situation of such danger , without trying to preserve her ."
austen#"It was his duty . "" Pray , Emma ,"" said he , "" may I ask in what lay the great amusement , the poignant sting of the last word given to you and Miss Fairfax ? I saw the word , and am curious to know how it could be so very entertaining to the one , and so very distressing to the other ."" Emma was extremely confused . She could not endure to give him the true explanation ; for though her suspicions were by no means removed , she was really ashamed of having ever imparted them . "" Oh !"""
austen#"she cried in evident embarrassment , "" it all meant nothing ; a mere joke among ourselves ."" "" The joke ,"" he replied gravely , "" seemed confined to you and Mr . Churchill ."" He had hoped she would speak again , but she did not . She would rather busy herself about any thing than speak . He sat a little while in doubt ."
austen#"A variety of evils crossed his mind . Interference -- fruitless interference . Emma ' s confusion , and the acknowledged intimacy , seemed to declare her affection engaged . Yet he would speak . He owed it to her , to risk any thing that might be involved in an unwelcome interference , rather than her welfare ; to encounter any thing , rather than the remembrance of neglect in such a cause . "" My dear Emma ,"" said he at last , with earnest kindness , "" do you think you perfectly understand the degree of acquaintance between the gentleman and lady we have been speaking of ?"""
austen#""" Between Mr . Frank Churchill and Miss Fairfax ? Oh ! yes , perfectly .-- Why do you make a doubt of it ?"" "" Have you never at any time had reason to think that he admired her , or that she admired him ?"" "" Never , never !"" she cried with a most open eagerness --"" Never , for the twentieth part of a moment , did such an idea occur to me ."
austen#"And how could it possibly come into your head ?"" "" I have lately imagined that I saw symptoms of attachment between them -- certain expressive looks , which I did not believe meant to be public ."" "" Oh ! you amuse me excessively . I am delighted to find that you can vouchsafe to let your imagination wander -- but it will not do -- very sorry to check you in your first essay -- but indeed it will not do . There is no admiration between them , I do assure you ; and the appearances which have caught you , have arisen from some peculiar circumstances -- feelings rather of a totally different nature -- it is impossible exactly to explain :-- there is a good deal of nonsense in it -- but the part which is capable of being communicated , which is sense , is , that they are as far from any attachment or admiration for one another , as any two beings in the world can be ."
austen#"That is , I _presume_ it to be so on her side , and I can _answer_ for its being so on his . I will answer for the gentleman ' s indifference ."" She spoke with a confidence which staggered , with a satisfaction which silenced , Mr . Knightley . She was in gay spirits , and would have prolonged the conversation , wanting to hear the particulars of his suspicions , every look described , and all the wheres and hows of a circumstance which highly entertained her : but his gaiety did not meet hers . He found he could not be useful , and his feelings were too much irritated for talking . That he might not be irritated into an absolute fever , by the fire which Mr . Woodhouse ' s tender habits required almost every evening throughout the year , he soon afterwards took a hasty leave , and walked home to the coolness and solitude of Donwell Abbey ."
austen#CHAPTER VI After being long fed with hopes of a speedy visit from Mr . and Mrs . Suckling , the Highbury world were obliged to endure the mortification of hearing that they could not possibly come till the autumn . No such importation of novelties could enrich their intellectual stores at present . In the daily interchange of news , they must be again restricted to the other topics with which for a while the Sucklings ' coming had been united , such as the last accounts of Mrs . Churchill , whose health seemed every day to supply a different report , and the situation of Mrs . Weston , whose happiness it was to be hoped might eventually be as much increased by the arrival of a child , as that of all her neighbours was by the approach of it . Mrs . Elton was very much disappointed . It was the delay of a great deal of pleasure and parade .
austen#Her introductions and recommendations must all wait , and every projected party be still only talked of . So she thought at first ;-- but a little consideration convinced her that every thing need not be put off . Why should not they explore to Box Hill though the Sucklings did not come ? They could go there again with them in the autumn . It was settled that they should go to Box Hill . That there was to be such a party had been long generally known : it had even given the idea of another .
austen#"Emma had never been to Box Hill ; she wished to see what every body found so well worth seeing , and she and Mr . Weston had agreed to chuse some fine morning and drive thither . Two or three more of the chosen only were to be admitted to join them , and it was to be done in a quiet , unpretending , elegant way , infinitely superior to the bustle and preparation , the regular eating and drinking , and picnic parade of the Eltons and the Sucklings . This was so very well understood between them , that Emma could not but feel some surprise , and a little displeasure , on hearing from Mr . Weston that he had been proposing to Mrs . Elton , as her brother and sister had failed her , that the two parties should unite , and go together ; and that as Mrs . Elton had very readily acceded to it , so it was to be , if she had no objection . Now , as her objection was nothing but her very great dislike of Mrs . Elton , of which Mr . Weston must already be perfectly aware , it was not worth bringing forward again :-- it could not be done without a reproof to him , which would be giving pain to his wife ; and she found herself therefore obliged to consent to an arrangement which she would have done a great deal to avoid ; an arrangement which would probably expose her even to the degradation of being said to be of Mrs . Elton ' s party ! Every feeling was offended ; and the forbearance of her outward submission left a heavy arrear due of secret severity in her reflections on the unmanageable goodwill of Mr . Weston ' s temper . "" I am glad you approve of what I have done ,"" said he very comfortably ."
austen#""" But I thought you would . Such schemes as these are nothing without numbers . One cannot have too large a party . A large party secures its own amusement . And she is a good - natured woman after all . One could not leave her out ."""
austen#"Emma denied none of it aloud , and agreed to none of it in private . It was now the middle of June , and the weather fine ; and Mrs . Elton was growing impatient to name the day , and settle with Mr . Weston as to pigeon - pies and cold lamb , when a lame carriage - horse threw every thing into sad uncertainty . It might be weeks , it might be only a few days , before the horse were useable ; but no preparations could be ventured on , and it was all melancholy stagnation . Mrs . Elton ' s resources were inadequate to such an attack . "" Is not this most vexations , Knightley ?"" she cried .--"" And such weather for exploring !-- These delays and disappointments are quite odious ."
austen#"What are we to do ?-- The year will wear away at this rate , and nothing done . Before this time last year I assure you we had had a delightful exploring party from Maple Grove to Kings Weston ."" "" You had better explore to Donwell ,"" replied Mr . Knightley . "" That may be done without horses . Come , and eat my strawberries . They are ripening fast ."""
austen#"If Mr . Knightley did not begin seriously , he was obliged to proceed so , for his proposal was caught at with delight ; and the "" Oh ! I should like it of all things ,"" was not plainer in words than manner . Donwell was famous for its strawberry - beds , which seemed a plea for the invitation : but no plea was necessary ; cabbage - beds would have been enough to tempt the lady , who only wanted to be going somewhere . She promised him again and again to come -- much oftener than he doubted -- and was extremely gratified by such a proof of intimacy , such a distinguishing compliment as she chose to consider it . "" You may depend upon me ,"" said she . "" I certainly will come ."
austen#"Name your day , and I will come . You will allow me to bring Jane Fairfax ?"" "" I cannot name a day ,"" said he , "" till I have spoken to some others whom I would wish to meet you ."" "" Oh ! leave all that to me . Only give me a carte - blanche .-- I am Lady Patroness , you know ."
austen#"It is my party . I will bring friends with me ."" "" I hope you will bring Elton ,"" said he : "" but I will not trouble you to give any other invitations ."" "" Oh ! now you are looking very sly . But consider -- you need not be afraid of delegating power to _me_ ."
austen#"I am no young lady on her preferment . Married women , you know , may be safely authorised . It is my party . Leave it all to me . I will invite your guests ."" "" No ,""-- he calmly replied ,--"" there is but one married woman in the world whom I can ever allow to invite what guests she pleases to Donwell , and that one is --"""
austen#"""-- Mrs . Weston , I suppose ,"" interrupted Mrs . Elton , rather mortified . "" No -- Mrs . Knightley ;-- and till she is in being , I will manage such matters myself ."" "" Ah ! you are an odd creature !"" she cried , satisfied to have no one preferred to herself .--"" You are a humourist , and may say what you like . Quite a humourist ."
austen#"Well , I shall bring Jane with me -- Jane and her aunt .-- The rest I leave to you . I have no objections at all to meeting the Hartfield family . Don ' t scruple . I know you are attached to them ."" "" You certainly will meet them if I can prevail ; and I shall call on Miss Bates in my way home ."" "" That ' s quite unnecessary ; I see Jane every day :-- but as you like ."
austen#It is to be a morning scheme , you know , Knightley ; quite a simple thing . I shall wear a large bonnet , and bring one of my little baskets hanging on my arm . Here ,-- probably this basket with pink ribbon . Nothing can be more simple , you see . And Jane will have such another . There is to be no form or parade -- a sort of gipsy party .
austen#"We are to walk about your gardens , and gather the strawberries ourselves , and sit under trees ;-- and whatever else you may like to provide , it is to be all out of doors -- a table spread in the shade , you know . Every thing as natural and simple as possible . Is not that your idea ?"" "" Not quite . My idea of the simple and the natural will be to have the table spread in the dining - room . The nature and the simplicity of gentlemen and ladies , with their servants and furniture , I think is best observed by meals within doors ."
austen#"[ Persuasion by Jane Austen 1818 ] Chapter 1 Sir Walter Elliot , of Kellynch Hall , in Somersetshire , was a man who , for his own amusement , never took up any book but the Baronetage ; there he found occupation for an idle hour , and consolation in a distressed one ; there his faculties were roused into admiration and respect , by contemplating the limited remnant of the earliest patents ; there any unwelcome sensations , arising from domestic affairs changed naturally into pity and contempt as he turned over the almost endless creations of the last century ; and there , if every other leaf were powerless , he could read his own history with an interest which never failed . This was the page at which the favourite volume always opened : "" ELLIOT OF KELLYNCH HALL . "" Walter Elliot , born March 1 , 1760 , married , July 15 , 1784 , Elizabeth , daughter of James Stevenson , Esq ."
austen#"of South Park , in the county of Gloucester , by which lady ( who died 1800 ) he has issue Elizabeth , born June 1 , 1785 ; Anne , born August 9 , 1787 ; a still - born son , November 5 , 1789 ; Mary , born November 20 , 1791 ."" Precisely such had the paragraph originally stood from the printer ' s hands ; but Sir Walter had improved it by adding , for the information of himself and his family , these words , after the date of Mary ' s birth -- "" Married , December 16 , 1810 , Charles , son and heir of Charles Musgrove , Esq . of Uppercross , in the county of Somerset ,"" and by inserting most accurately the day of the month on which he had lost his wife . Then followed the history and rise of the ancient and respectable family , in the usual terms ; how it had been first settled in Cheshire ; how mentioned in Dugdale , serving the office of high sheriff , representing a borough in three successive parliaments , exertions of loyalty , and dignity of baronet , in the first year of Charles II , with all the Marys and Elizabeths they had married ; forming altogether two handsome duodecimo pages , and concluding with the arms and motto :--"" Principal seat , Kellynch Hall , in the county of Somerset ,"" and Sir Walter ' s handwriting again in this finale :-- "" Heir presumptive , William Walter Elliot , Esq ., great grandson of the second Sir Walter ."" Vanity was the beginning and the end of Sir Walter Elliot ' s character ; vanity of person and of situation ."
austen#He had been remarkably handsome in his youth ; and , at fifty - four , was still a very fine man . Few women could think more of their personal appearance than he did , nor could the valet of any new made lord be more delighted with the place he held in society . He considered the blessing of beauty as inferior only to the blessing of a baronetcy ; and the Sir Walter Elliot , who united these gifts , was the constant object of his warmest respect and devotion . His good looks and his rank had one fair claim on his attachment ; since to them he must have owed a wife of very superior character to any thing deserved by his own . Lady Elliot had been an excellent woman , sensible and amiable ; whose judgement and conduct , if they might be pardoned the youthful infatuation which made her Lady Elliot , had never required indulgence afterwards .-- She had humoured , or softened , or concealed his failings , and promoted his real respectability for seventeen years ; and though not the very happiest being in the world herself , had found enough in her duties , her friends , and her children , to attach her to life , and make it no matter of indifference to her when she was called on to quit them . -- Three girls , the two eldest sixteen and fourteen , was an awful legacy for a mother to bequeath , an awful charge rather , to confide to the authority and guidance of a conceited , silly father .
austen#She had , however , one very intimate friend , a sensible , deserving woman , who had been brought , by strong attachment to herself , to settle close by her , in the village of Kellynch ; and on her kindness and advice , Lady Elliot mainly relied for the best help and maintenance of the good principles and instruction which she had been anxiously giving her daughters . This friend , and Sir Walter , did not marry , whatever might have been anticipated on that head by their acquaintance . Thirteen years had passed away since Lady Elliot ' s death , and they were still near neighbours and intimate friends , and one remained a widower , the other a widow . That Lady Russell , of steady age and character , and extremely well provided for , should have no thought of a second marriage , needs no apology to the public , which is rather apt to be unreasonably discontented when a woman does marry again , than when she does not ; but Sir Walter ' s continuing in singleness requires explanation . Be it known then , that Sir Walter , like a good father , ( having met with one or two private disappointments in very unreasonable applications ), prided himself on remaining single for his dear daughters ' sake . For one daughter , his eldest , he would really have given up any thing , which he had not been very much tempted to do .
austen#Elizabeth had succeeded , at sixteen , to all that was possible , of her mother ' s rights and consequence ; and being very handsome , and very like himself , her influence had always been great , and they had gone on together most happily . His two other children were of very inferior value . Mary had acquired a little artificial importance , by becoming Mrs Charles Musgrove ; but Anne , with an elegance of mind and sweetness of character , which must have placed her high with any people of real understanding , was nobody with either father or sister ; her word had no weight , her convenience was always to give way -- she was only Anne . To Lady Russell , indeed , she was a most dear and highly valued god - daughter , favourite , and friend . Lady Russell loved them all ; but it was only in Anne that she could fancy the mother to revive again . A few years before , Anne Elliot had been a very pretty girl , but her bloom had vanished early ; and as even in its height , her father had found little to admire in her , ( so totally different were her delicate features and mild dark eyes from his own ), there could be nothing in them , now that she was faded and thin , to excite his esteem .
austen#He had never indulged much hope , he had now none , of ever reading her name in any other page of his favourite work . All equality of alliance must rest with Elizabeth , for Mary had merely connected herself with an old country family of respectability and large fortune , and had therefore given all the honour and received none : Elizabeth would , one day or other , marry suitably . It sometimes happens that a woman is handsomer at twenty - nine than she was ten years before ; and , generally speaking , if there has been neither ill health nor anxiety , it is a time of life at which scarcely any charm is lost . It was so with Elizabeth , still the same handsome Miss Elliot that she had begun to be thirteen years ago , and Sir Walter might be excused , therefore , in forgetting her age , or , at least , be deemed only half a fool , for thinking himself and Elizabeth as blooming as ever , amidst the wreck of the good looks of everybody else ; for he could plainly see how old all the rest of his family and acquaintance were growing . Anne haggard , Mary coarse , every face in the neighbourhood worsting , and the rapid increase of the crow ' s foot about Lady Russell ' s temples had long been a distress to him . Elizabeth did not quite equal her father in personal contentment .
austen#Thirteen years had seen her mistress of Kellynch Hall , presiding and directing with a self - possession and decision which could never have given the idea of her being younger than she was . For thirteen years had she been doing the honours , and laying down the domestic law at home , and leading the way to the chaise and four , and walking immediately after Lady Russell out of all the drawing - rooms and dining - rooms in the country . Thirteen winters ' revolving frosts had seen her opening every ball of credit which a scanty neighbourhood afforded , and thirteen springs shewn their blossoms , as she travelled up to London with her father , for a few weeks ' annual enjoyment of the great world . She had the remembrance of all this , she had the consciousness of being nine - and - twenty to give her some regrets and some apprehensions ; she was fully satisfied of being still quite as handsome as ever , but she felt her approach to the years of danger , and would have rejoiced to be certain of being properly solicited by baronet - blood within the next twelvemonth or two . Then might she again take up the book of books with as much enjoyment as in her early youth , but now she liked it not . Always to be presented with the date of her own birth and see no marriage follow but that of a youngest sister , made the book an evil ; and more than once , when her father had left it open on the table near her , had she closed it , with averted eyes , and pushed it away .
austen#She had had a disappointment , moreover , which that book , and especially the history of her own family , must ever present the remembrance of . The heir presumptive , the very William Walter Elliot , Esq ., whose rights had been so generously supported by her father , had disappointed her . She had , while a very young girl , as soon as she had known him to be , in the event of her having no brother , the future baronet , meant to marry him , and her father had always meant that she should . He had not been known to them as a boy ; but soon after Lady Elliot ' s death , Sir Walter had sought the acquaintance , and though his overtures had not been met with any warmth , he had persevered in seeking it , making allowance for the modest drawing - back of youth ; and , in one of their spring excursions to London , when Elizabeth was in her first bloom , Mr Elliot had been forced into the introduction . He was at that time a very young man , just engaged in the study of the law ; and Elizabeth found him extremely agreeable , and every plan in his favour was confirmed . He was invited to Kellynch Hall ; he was talked of and expected all the rest of the year ; but he never came .
austen#"The following spring he was seen again in town , found equally agreeable , again encouraged , invited , and expected , and again he did not come ; and the next tidings were that he was married . Instead of pushing his fortune in the line marked out for the heir of the house of Elliot , he had purchased independence by uniting himself to a rich woman of inferior birth . Sir Walter has resented it . As the head of the house , he felt that he ought to have been consulted , especially after taking the young man so publicly by the hand ; "" For they must have been seen together ,"" he observed , "" once at Tattersall ' s , and twice in the lobby of the House of Commons ."" His disapprobation was expressed , but apparently very little regarded . Mr Elliot had attempted no apology , and shewn himself as unsolicitous of being longer noticed by the family , as Sir Walter considered him unworthy of it : all acquaintance between them had ceased ."
austen#This very awkward history of Mr Elliot was still , after an interval of several years , felt with anger by Elizabeth , who had liked the man for himself , and still more for being her father ' s heir , and whose strong family pride could see only in him a proper match for Sir Walter Elliot ' s eldest daughter . There was not a baronet from A to Z whom her feelings could have so willingly acknowledged as an equal . Yet so miserably had he conducted himself , that though she was at this present time ( the summer of 1814 ) wearing black ribbons for his wife , she could not admit him to be worth thinking of again . The disgrace of his first marriage might , perhaps , as there was no reason to suppose it perpetuated by offspring , have been got over , had he not done worse ; but he had , as by the accustomary intervention of kind friends , they had been informed , spoken most disrespectfully of them all , most slightingly and contemptuously of the very blood he belonged to , and the honours which were hereafter to be his own . This could not be pardoned . Such were Elizabeth Elliot ' s sentiments and sensations ; such the cares to alloy , the agitations to vary , the sameness and the elegance , the prosperity and the nothingness of her scene of life ; such the feelings to give interest to a long , uneventful residence in one country circle , to fill the vacancies which there were no habits of utility abroad , no talents or accomplishments for home , to occupy .
austen#But now , another occupation and solicitude of mind was beginning to be added to these . Her father was growing distressed for money . She knew , that when he now took up the Baronetage , it was to drive the heavy bills of his tradespeople , and the unwelcome hints of Mr Shepherd , his agent , from his thoughts . The Kellynch property was good , but not equal to Sir Walter ' s apprehension of the state required in its possessor . While Lady Elliot lived , there had been method , moderation , and economy , which had just kept him within his income ; but with her had died all such right - mindedness , and from that period he had been constantly exceeding it . It had not been possible for him to spend less ; he had done nothing but what Sir Walter Elliot was imperiously called on to do ; but blameless as he was , he was not only growing dreadfully in debt , but was hearing of it so often , that it became vain to attempt concealing it longer , even partially , from his daughter .
austen#"He had given her some hints of it the last spring in town ; he had gone so far even as to say , "" Can we retrench ? Does it occur to you that there is any one article in which we can retrench ?"" and Elizabeth , to do her justice , had , in the first ardour of female alarm , set seriously to think what could be done , and had finally proposed these two branches of economy , to cut off some unnecessary charities , and to refrain from new furnishing the drawing - room ; to which expedients she afterwards added the happy thought of their taking no present down to Anne , as had been the usual yearly custom . But these measures , however good in themselves , were insufficient for the real extent of the evil , the whole of which Sir Walter found himself obliged to confess to her soon afterwards . Elizabeth had nothing to propose of deeper efficacy . She felt herself ill - used and unfortunate , as did her father ; and they were neither of them able to devise any means of lessening their expenses without compromising their dignity , or relinquishing their comforts in a way not to be borne ."
austen#There was only a small part of his estate that Sir Walter could dispose of ; but had every acre been alienable , it would have made no difference . He had condescended to mortgage as far as he had the power , but he would never condescend to sell . No ; he would never disgrace his name so far . The Kellynch estate should be transmitted whole and entire , as he had received it . Their two confidential friends , Mr Shepherd , who lived in the neighbouring market town , and Lady Russell , were called to advise them ; and both father and daughter seemed to expect that something should be struck out by one or the other to remove their embarrassments and reduce their expenditure , without involving the loss of any indulgence of taste or pride . Chapter 2
austen#Mr Shepherd , a civil , cautious lawyer , who , whatever might be his hold or his views on Sir Walter , would rather have the disagreeable prompted by anybody else , excused himself from offering the slightest hint , and only begged leave to recommend an implicit reference to the excellent judgement of Lady Russell , from whose known good sense he fully expected to have just such resolute measures advised as he meant to see finally adopted . Lady Russell was most anxiously zealous on the subject , and gave it much serious consideration . She was a woman rather of sound than of quick abilities , whose difficulties in coming to any decision in this instance were great , from the opposition of two leading principles . She was of strict integrity herself , with a delicate sense of honour ; but she was as desirous of saving Sir Walter ' s feelings , as solicitous for the credit of the family , as aristocratic in her ideas of what was due to them , as anybody of sense and honesty could well be . She was a benevolent , charitable , good woman , and capable of strong attachments , most correct in her conduct , strict in her notions of decorum , and with manners that were held a standard of good - breeding . She had a cultivated mind , and was , generally speaking , rational and consistent ; but she had prejudices on the side of ancestry ; she had a value for rank and consequence , which blinded her a little to the faults of those who possessed them .
austen#Herself the widow of only a knight , she gave the dignity of a baronet all its due ; and Sir Walter , independent of his claims as an old acquaintance , an attentive neighbour , an obliging landlord , the husband of her very dear friend , the father of Anne and her sisters , was , as being Sir Walter , in her apprehension , entitled to a great deal of compassion and consideration under his present difficulties . They must retrench ; that did not admit of a doubt . But she was very anxious to have it done with the least possible pain to him and Elizabeth . She drew up plans of economy , she made exact calculations , and she did what nobody else thought of doing : she consulted Anne , who never seemed considered by the others as having any interest in the question . She consulted , and in a degree was influenced by her in marking out the scheme of retrenchment which was at last submitted to Sir Walter . Every emendation of Anne ' s had been on the side of honesty against importance .
austen#"She wanted more vigorous measures , a more complete reformation , a quicker release from debt , a much higher tone of indifference for everything but justice and equity . "" If we can persuade your father to all this ,"" said Lady Russell , looking over her paper , "" much may be done . If he will adopt these regulations , in seven years he will be clear ; and I hope we may be able to convince him and Elizabeth , that Kellynch Hall has a respectability in itself which cannot be affected by these reductions ; and that the true dignity of Sir Walter Elliot will be very far from lessened in the eyes of sensible people , by acting like a man of principle . What will he be doing , in fact , but what very many of our first families have done , or ought to do ? There will be nothing singular in his case ; and it is singularity which often makes the worst part of our suffering , as it always does of our conduct . I have great hope of prevailing ."
austen#"We must be serious and decided ; for after all , the person who has contracted debts must pay them ; and though a great deal is due to the feelings of the gentleman , and the head of a house , like your father , there is still more due to the character of an honest man ."" This was the principle on which Anne wanted her father to be proceeding , his friends to be urging him . She considered it as an act of indispensable duty to clear away the claims of creditors with all the expedition which the most comprehensive retrenchments could secure , and saw no dignity in anything short of it . She wanted it to be prescribed , and felt as a duty . She rated Lady Russell ' s influence highly ; and as to the severe degree of self - denial which her own conscience prompted , she believed there might be little more difficulty in persuading them to a complete , than to half a reformation . Her knowledge of her father and Elizabeth inclined her to think that the sacrifice of one pair of horses would be hardly less painful than of both , and so on , through the whole list of Lady Russell ' s too gentle reductions ."
austen#"How Anne ' s more rigid requisitions might have been taken is of little consequence . Lady Russell ' s had no success at all : could not be put up with , were not to be borne . "" What ! every comfort of life knocked off ! Journeys , London , servants , horses , table -- contractions and restrictions every where ! To live no longer with the decencies even of a private gentleman !"
austen#"No , he would sooner quit Kellynch Hall at once , than remain in it on such disgraceful terms ."" "" Quit Kellynch Hall ."" The hint was immediately taken up by Mr Shepherd , whose interest was involved in the reality of Sir Walter ' s retrenching , and who was perfectly persuaded that nothing would be done without a change of abode . "" Since the idea had been started in the very quarter which ought to dictate , he had no scruple ,"" he said , "" in confessing his judgement to be entirely on that side . It did not appear to him that Sir Walter could materially alter his style of living in a house which had such a character of hospitality and ancient dignity to support . In any other place Sir Walter might judge for himself ; and would be looked up to , as regulating the modes of life in whatever way he might choose to model his household ."""
austen#Sir Walter would quit Kellynch Hall ; and after a very few days more of doubt and indecision , the great question of whither he should go was settled , and the first outline of this important change made out . There had been three alternatives , London , Bath , or another house in the country . All Anne ' s wishes had been for the latter . A small house in their own neighbourhood , where they might still have Lady Russell ' s society , still be near Mary , and still have the pleasure of sometimes seeing the lawns and groves of Kellynch , was the object of her ambition . But the usual fate of Anne attended her , in having something very opposite from her inclination fixed on . She disliked Bath , and did not think it agreed with her ; and Bath was to be her home .
austen#Sir Walter had at first thought more of London ; but Mr Shepherd felt that he could not be trusted in London , and had been skilful enough to dissuade him from it , and make Bath preferred . It was a much safer place for a gentleman in his predicament : he might there be important at comparatively little expense . Two material advantages of Bath over London had of course been given all their weight : its more convenient distance from Kellynch , only fifty miles , and Lady Russell ' s spending some part of every winter there ; and to the very great satisfaction of Lady Russell , whose first views on the projected change had been for Bath , Sir Walter and Elizabeth were induced to believe that they should lose neither consequence nor enjoyment by settling there . Lady Russell felt obliged to oppose her dear Anne ' s known wishes . It would be too much to expect Sir Walter to descend into a small house in his own neighbourhood . Anne herself would have found the mortifications of it more than she foresaw , and to Sir Walter ' s feelings they must have been dreadful .
austen#And with regard to Anne ' s dislike of Bath , she considered it as a prejudice and mistake arising , first , from the circumstance of her having been three years at school there , after her mother ' s death ; and secondly , from her happening to be not in perfectly good spirits the only winter which she had afterwards spent there with herself . Lady Russell was fond of Bath , in short , and disposed to think it must suit them all ; and as to her young friend ' s health , by passing all the warm months with her at Kellynch Lodge , every danger would be avoided ; and it was in fact , a change which must do both health and spirits good . Anne had been too little from home , too little seen . Her spirits were not high . A larger society would improve them . She wanted her to be more known .
austen#"The undesirableness of any other house in the same neighbourhood for Sir Walter was certainly much strengthened by one part , and a very material part of the scheme , which had been happily engrafted on the beginning . He was not only to quit his home , but to see it in the hands of others ; a trial of fortitude , which stronger heads than Sir Walter ' s have found too much . Kellynch Hall was to be let . This , however , was a profound secret , not to be breathed beyond their own circle . Sir Walter could not have borne the degradation of being known to design letting his house . Mr Shepherd had once mentioned the word "" advertise ,"" but never dared approach it again ."
austen#Sir Walter spurned the idea of its being offered in any manner ; forbad the slightest hint being dropped of his having such an intention ; and it was only on the supposition of his being spontaneously solicited by some most unexceptionable applicant , on his own terms , and as a great favour , that he would let it at all . How quick come the reasons for approving what we like ! Lady Russell had another excellent one at hand , for being extremely glad that Sir Walter and his family were to remove from the country . Elizabeth had been lately forming an intimacy , which she wished to see interrupted . It was with the daughter of Mr Shepherd , who had returned , after an unprosperous marriage , to her father ' s house , with the additional burden of two children . She was a clever young woman , who understood the art of pleasing -- the art of pleasing , at least , at Kellynch Hall ; and who had made herself so acceptable to Miss Elliot , as to have been already staying there more than once , in spite of all that Lady Russell , who thought it a friendship quite out of place , could hint of caution and reserve .
austen#"Lady Russell , indeed , had scarcely any influence with Elizabeth , and seemed to love her , rather because she would love her , than because Elizabeth deserved it . She had never received from her more than outward attention , nothing beyond the observances of complaisance ; had never succeeded in any point which she wanted to carry , against previous inclination . She had been repeatedly very earnest in trying to get Anne included in the visit to London , sensibly open to all the injustice and all the discredit of the selfish arrangements which shut her out , and on many lesser occasions had endeavoured to give Elizabeth the advantage of her own better judgement and experience ; but always in vain : Elizabeth would go her own way ; and never had she pursued it in more decided opposition to Lady Russell than in this selection of Mrs Clay ; turning from the society of so deserving a sister , to bestow her affection and confidence on one who ought to have been nothing to her but the object of distant civility . From situation , Mrs Clay was , in Lady Russell ' s estimate , a very unequal , and in her character she believed a very dangerous companion ; and a removal that would leave Mrs Clay behind , and bring a choice of more suitable intimates within Miss Elliot ' s reach , was therefore an object of first - rate importance . Chapter 3 "" I must take leave to observe , Sir Walter ,"" said Mr Shepherd one morning at Kellynch Hall , as he laid down the newspaper , "" that the present juncture is much in our favour ."
austen#"This peace will be turning all our rich naval officers ashore . They will be all wanting a home . Could not be a better time , Sir Walter , for having a choice of tenants , very responsible tenants . Many a noble fortune has been made during the war . If a rich admiral were to come in our way , Sir Walter --"" "" He would be a very lucky man , Shepherd ,"" replied Sir Walter ; "" that ' s all I have to remark ."
austen#"A prize indeed would Kellynch Hall be to him ; rather the greatest prize of all , let him have taken ever so many before ; hey , Shepherd ?"" Mr Shepherd laughed , as he knew he must , at this wit , and then added -- "" I presume to observe , Sir Walter , that , in the way of business , gentlemen of the navy are well to deal with . I have had a little knowledge of their methods of doing business ; and I am free to confess that they have very liberal notions , and are as likely to make desirable tenants as any set of people one should meet with . Therefore , Sir Walter , what I would take leave to suggest is , that if in consequence of any rumours getting abroad of your intention ; which must be contemplated as a possible thing , because we know how difficult it is to keep the actions and designs of one part of the world from the notice and curiosity of the other ; consequence has its tax ; I , John Shepherd , might conceal any family - matters that I chose , for nobody would think it worth their while to observe me ; but Sir Walter Elliot has eyes upon him which it may be very difficult to elude ; and therefore , thus much I venture upon , that it will not greatly surprise me if , with all our caution , some rumour of the truth should get abroad ; in the supposition of which , as I was going to observe , since applications will unquestionably follow , I should think any from our wealthy naval commanders particularly worth attending to ; and beg leave to add , that two hours will bring me over at any time , to save you the trouble of replying ."" Sir Walter only nodded ."
austen#"But soon afterwards , rising and pacing the room , he observed sarcastically -- "" There are few among the gentlemen of the navy , I imagine , who would not be surprised to find themselves in a house of this description ."" "" They would look around them , no doubt , and bless their good fortune ,"" said Mrs Clay , for Mrs Clay was present : her father had driven her over , nothing being of so much use to Mrs Clay ' s health as a drive to Kellynch : "" but I quite agree with my father in thinking a sailor might be a very desirable tenant . I have known a good deal of the profession ; and besides their liberality , they are so neat and careful in all their ways ! These valuable pictures of yours , Sir Walter , if you chose to leave them , would be perfectly safe . Everything in and about the house would be taken such excellent care of !"
austen#"The gardens and shrubberies would be kept in almost as high order as they are now . You need not be afraid , Miss Elliot , of your own sweet flower gardens being neglected ."" "" As to all that ,"" rejoined Sir Walter coolly , "" supposing I were induced to let my house , I have by no means made up my mind as to the privileges to be annexed to it . I am not particularly disposed to favour a tenant . The park would be open to him of course , and few navy officers , or men of any other description , can have had such a range ; but what restrictions I might impose on the use of the pleasure - grounds , is another thing . I am not fond of the idea of my shrubberies being always approachable ; and I should recommend Miss Elliot to be on her guard with respect to her flower garden ."
austen#"I am very little disposed to grant a tenant of Kellynch Hall any extraordinary favour , I assure you , be he sailor or soldier ."" After a short pause , Mr Shepherd presumed to say -- "" In all these cases , there are established usages which make everything plain and easy between landlord and tenant . Your interest , Sir Walter , is in pretty safe hands . Depend upon me for taking care that no tenant has more than his just rights . I venture to hint , that Sir Walter Elliot cannot be half so jealous for his own , as John Shepherd will be for him ."""
austen#"Here Anne spoke -- "" The navy , I think , who have done so much for us , have at least an equal claim with any other set of men , for all the comforts and all the privileges which any home can give . Sailors work hard enough for their comforts , we must all allow ."" "" Very true , very true . What Miss Anne says , is very true ,"" was Mr Shepherd ' s rejoinder , and "" Oh ! certainly ,"" was his daughter ' s ; but Sir Walter ' s remark was , soon afterwards --"
austen#""" The profession has its utility , but I should be sorry to see any friend of mine belonging to it ."" "" Indeed !"" was the reply , and with a look of surprise . "" Yes ; it is in two points offensive to me ; I have two strong grounds of objection to it . First , as being the means of bringing persons of obscure birth into undue distinction , and raising men to honours which their fathers and grandfathers never dreamt of ; and secondly , as it cuts up a man ' s youth and vigour most horribly ; a sailor grows old sooner than any other man . I have observed it all my life ."
austen#A man is in greater danger in the navy of being insulted by the rise of one whose father , his father might have disdained to speak to , and of becoming prematurely an object of disgust himself , than in any other line . One day last spring , in town , I was in company with two men , striking instances of what I am talking of ; Lord St Ives , whose father we all know to have been a country curate , without bread to eat ; I was to give place to Lord St Ives , and a certain Admiral Baldwin , the most deplorable - looking personage you can imagine ; his face the colour of mahogany , rough and rugged to the last degree ; all lines and wrinkles , nine grey hairs of a side , and nothing but a dab of powder at top . ` In the name of heaven , who is that old fellow ?' said I to a friend of mine who was standing near , ( Sir Basil Morley ). ` Old fellow !' cried Sir Basil , ` it is Admiral Baldwin .
austen#"What do you take his age to be ?' ` Sixty ,' said I , ` or perhaps sixty - two .' ` Forty ,' replied Sir Basil , ` forty , and no more .' Picture to yourselves my amazement ; I shall not easily forget Admiral Baldwin . I never saw quite so wretched an example of what a sea - faring life can do ; but to a degree , I know it is the same with them all : they are all knocked about , and exposed to every climate , and every weather , till they are not fit to be seen . It is a pity they are not knocked on the head at once , before they reach Admiral Baldwin ' s age ."""
austen#""" Nay , Sir Walter ,"" cried Mrs Clay , "" this is being severe indeed . Have a little mercy on the poor men . We are not all born to be handsome . The sea is no beautifier , certainly ; sailors do grow old betimes ; I have observed it ; they soon lose the look of youth . But then , is not it the same with many other professions , perhaps most other ? Soldiers , in active service , are not at all better off : and even in the quieter professions , there is a toil and a labour of the mind , if not of the body , which seldom leaves a man ' s looks to the natural effect of time ."
austen#"The lawyer plods , quite care - worn ; the physician is up at all hours , and travelling in all weather ; and even the clergyman --"" she stopt a moment to consider what might do for the clergyman ;--"" and even the clergyman , you know is obliged to go into infected rooms , and expose his health and looks to all the injury of a poisonous atmosphere . In fact , as I have long been convinced , though every profession is necessary and honourable in its turn , it is only the lot of those who are not obliged to follow any , who can live in a regular way , in the country , choosing their own hours , following their own pursuits , and living on their own property , without the torment of trying for more ; it is only their lot , I say , to hold the blessings of health and a good appearance to the utmost : I know no other set of men but what lose something of their personableness when they cease to be quite young ."" It seemed as if Mr Shepherd , in this anxiety to bespeak Sir Walter ' s good will towards a naval officer as tenant , had been gifted with foresight ; for the very first application for the house was from an Admiral Croft , with whom he shortly afterwards fell into company in attending the quarter sessions at Taunton ; and indeed , he had received a hint of the Admiral from a London correspondent . By the report which he hastened over to Kellynch to make , Admiral Croft was a native of Somersetshire , who having acquired a very handsome fortune , was wishing to settle in his own country , and had come down to Taunton in order to look at some advertised places in that immediate neighbourhood , which , however , had not suited him ; that accidentally hearing --( it was just as he had foretold , Mr Shepherd observed , Sir Walter ' s concerns could not be kept a secret ,)-- accidentally hearing of the possibility of Kellynch Hall being to let , and understanding his ( Mr Shepherd ' s ) connection with the owner , he had introduced himself to him in order to make particular inquiries , and had , in the course of a pretty long conference , expressed as strong an inclination for the place as a man who knew it only by description could feel ; and given Mr Shepherd , in his explicit account of himself , every proof of his being a most responsible , eligible tenant . "" And who is Admiral Croft ?"" was Sir Walter ' s cold suspicious inquiry ."
austen#"Mr Shepherd answered for his being of a gentleman ' s family , and mentioned a place ; and Anne , after the little pause which followed , added -- "" He is a rear admiral of the white . He was in the Trafalgar action , and has been in the East Indies since ; he was stationed there , I believe , several years ."" "" Then I take it for granted ,"" observed Sir Walter , "" that his face is about as orange as the cuffs and capes of my livery ."" Mr Shepherd hastened to assure him , that Admiral Croft was a very hale , hearty , well - looking man , a little weather - beaten , to be sure , but not much , and quite the gentleman in all his notions and behaviour ; not likely to make the smallest difficulty about terms , only wanted a comfortable home , and to get into it as soon as possible ; knew he must pay for his convenience ; knew what rent a ready - furnished house of that consequence might fetch ; should not have been surprised if Sir Walter had asked more ; had inquired about the manor ; would be glad of the deputation , certainly , but made no great point of it ; said he sometimes took out a gun , but never killed ; quite the gentleman . Mr Shepherd was eloquent on the subject ; pointing out all the circumstances of the Admiral ' s family , which made him peculiarly desirable as a tenant ."
austen#"He was a married man , and without children ; the very state to be wished for . A house was never taken good care of , Mr Shepherd observed , without a lady : he did not know , whether furniture might not be in danger of suffering as much where there was no lady , as where there were many children . A lady , without a family , was the very best preserver of furniture in the world . He had seen Mrs Croft , too ; she was at Taunton with the admiral , and had been present almost all the time they were talking the matter over . "" And a very well - spoken , genteel , shrewd lady , she seemed to be ,"" continued he ; "" asked more questions about the house , and terms , and taxes , than the Admiral himself , and seemed more conversant with business ; and moreover , Sir Walter , I found she was not quite unconnected in this country , any more than her husband ; that is to say , she is sister to a gentleman who did live amongst us once ; she told me so herself : sister to the gentleman who lived a few years back at Monkford . Bless me !"
austen#"what was his name ? At this moment I cannot recollect his name , though I have heard it so lately . Penelope , my dear , can you help me to the name of the gentleman who lived at Monkford : Mrs Croft ' s brother ?"" But Mrs Clay was talking so eagerly with Miss Elliot , that she did not hear the appeal . "" I have no conception whom you can mean , Shepherd ; I remember no gentleman resident at Monkford since the time of old Governor Trent ."" "" Bless me !"
austen#"how very odd ! I shall forget my own name soon , I suppose . A name that I am so very well acquainted with ; knew the gentleman so well by sight ; seen him a hundred times ; came to consult me once , I remember , about a trespass of one of his neighbours ; farmer ' s man breaking into his orchard ; wall torn down ; apples stolen ; caught in the fact ; and afterwards , contrary to my judgement , submitted to an amicable compromise . Very odd indeed !"" After waiting another moment -- "" You mean Mr Wentworth , I suppose ?"""
austen#"said Anne . Mr Shepherd was all gratitude . "" Wentworth was the very name ! Mr Wentworth was the very man . He had the curacy of Monkford , you know , Sir Walter , some time back , for two or three years . Came there about the year --- 5 , I take it ."
austen#"You remember him , I am sure ."" "" Wentworth ? Oh ! ay ,-- Mr Wentworth , the curate of Monkford . You misled me by the term gentleman . I thought you were speaking of some man of property : Mr Wentworth was nobody , I remember ; quite unconnected ; nothing to do with the Strafford family ."
austen#"One wonders how the names of many of our nobility become so common ."" As Mr Shepherd perceived that this connexion of the Crofts did them no service with Sir Walter , he mentioned it no more ; returning , with all his zeal , to dwell on the circumstances more indisputably in their favour ; their age , and number , and fortune ; the high idea they had formed of Kellynch Hall , and extreme solicitude for the advantage of renting it ; making it appear as if they ranked nothing beyond the happiness of being the tenants of Sir Walter Elliot : an extraordinary taste , certainly , could they have been supposed in the secret of Sir Walter ' s estimate of the dues of a tenant . It succeeded , however ; and though Sir Walter must ever look with an evil eye on anyone intending to inhabit that house , and think them infinitely too well off in being permitted to rent it on the highest terms , he was talked into allowing Mr Shepherd to proceed in the treaty , and authorising him to wait on Admiral Croft , who still remained at Taunton , and fix a day for the house being seen . Sir Walter was not very wise ; but still he had experience enough of the world to feel , that a more unobjectionable tenant , in all essentials , than Admiral Croft bid fair to be , could hardly offer . So far went his understanding ; and his vanity supplied a little additional soothing , in the Admiral ' s situation in life , which was just high enough , and not too high . "" I have let my house to Admiral Croft ,"" would sound extremely well ; very much better than to any mere Mr --; a Mr ( save , perhaps , some half dozen in the nation ,) always needs a note of explanation ."
austen#"An admiral speaks his own consequence , and , at the same time , can never make a baronet look small . In all their dealings and intercourse , Sir Walter Elliot must ever have the precedence . Nothing could be done without a reference to Elizabeth : but her inclination was growing so strong for a removal , that she was happy to have it fixed and expedited by a tenant at hand ; and not a word to suspend decision was uttered by her . Mr Shepherd was completely empowered to act ; and no sooner had such an end been reached , than Anne , who had been a most attentive listener to the whole , left the room , to seek the comfort of cool air for her flushed cheeks ; and as she walked along a favourite grove , said , with a gentle sigh , "" A few months more , and he , perhaps , may be walking here ."" Chapter 4 He was not Mr Wentworth , the former curate of Monkford , however suspicious appearances may be , but a Captain Frederick Wentworth , his brother , who being made commander in consequence of the action off St Domingo , and not immediately employed , had come into Somersetshire , in the summer of 1806 ; and having no parent living , found a home for half a year at Monkford ."
austen#He was , at that time , a remarkably fine young man , with a great deal of intelligence , spirit , and brilliancy ; and Anne an extremely pretty girl , with gentleness , modesty , taste , and feeling . Half the sum of attraction , on either side , might have been enough , for he had nothing to do , and she had hardly anybody to love ; but the encounter of such lavish recommendations could not fail . They were gradually acquainted , and when acquainted , rapidly and deeply in love . It would be difficult to say which had seen highest perfection in the other , or which had been the happiest : she , in receiving his declarations and proposals , or he in having them accepted . A short period of exquisite felicity followed , and but a short one . Troubles soon arose .
austen#Sir Walter , on being applied to , without actually withholding his consent , or saying it should never be , gave it all the negative of great astonishment , great coldness , great silence , and a professed resolution of doing nothing for his daughter . He thought it a very degrading alliance ; and Lady Russell , though with more tempered and pardonable pride , received it as a most unfortunate one . Anne Elliot , with all her claims of birth , beauty , and mind , to throw herself away at nineteen ; involve herself at nineteen in an engagement with a young man , who had nothing but himself to recommend him , and no hopes of attaining affluence , but in the chances of a most uncertain profession , and no connexions to secure even his farther rise in the profession , would be , indeed , a throwing away , which she grieved to think of ! Anne Elliot , so young ; known to so few , to be snatched off by a stranger without alliance or fortune ; or rather sunk by him into a state of most wearing , anxious , youth - killing dependence ! It must not be , if by any fair interference of friendship , any representations from one who had almost a mother ' s love , and mother ' s rights , it would be prevented . Captain Wentworth had no fortune .
austen#He had been lucky in his profession ; but spending freely , what had come freely , had realized nothing . But he was confident that he should soon be rich : full of life and ardour , he knew that he should soon have a ship , and soon be on a station that would lead to everything he wanted . He had always been lucky ; he knew he should be so still . Such confidence , powerful in its own warmth , and bewitching in the wit which often expressed it , must have been enough for Anne ; but Lady Russell saw it very differently . His sanguine temper , and fearlessness of mind , operated very differently on her . She saw in it but an aggravation of the evil .
austen#It only added a dangerous character to himself . He was brilliant , he was headstrong . Lady Russell had little taste for wit , and of anything approaching to imprudence a horror . She deprecated the connexion in every light . Such opposition , as these feelings produced , was more than Anne could combat . Young and gentle as she was , it might yet have been possible to withstand her father ' s ill - will , though unsoftened by one kind word or look on the part of her sister ; but Lady Russell , whom she had always loved and relied on , could not , with such steadiness of opinion , and such tenderness of manner , be continually advising her in vain .
austen#She was persuaded to believe the engagement a wrong thing : indiscreet , improper , hardly capable of success , and not deserving it . But it was not a merely selfish caution , under which she acted , in putting an end to it . Had she not imagined herself consulting his good , even more than her own , she could hardly have given him up . The belief of being prudent , and self - denying , principally for his advantage , was her chief consolation , under the misery of a parting , a final parting ; and every consolation was required , for she had to encounter all the additional pain of opinions , on his side , totally unconvinced and unbending , and of his feeling himself ill used by so forced a relinquishment . He had left the country in consequence . A few months had seen the beginning and the end of their acquaintance ; but not with a few months ended Anne ' s share of suffering from it .
austen#Her attachment and regrets had , for a long time , clouded every enjoyment of youth , and an early loss of bloom and spirits had been their lasting effect . More than seven years were gone since this little history of sorrowful interest had reached its close ; and time had softened down much , perhaps nearly all of peculiar attachment to him , but she had been too dependent on time alone ; no aid had been given in change of place ( except in one visit to Bath soon after the rupture ), or in any novelty or enlargement of society . No one had ever come within the Kellynch circle , who could bear a comparison with Frederick Wentworth , as he stood in her memory . No second attachment , the only thoroughly natural , happy , and sufficient cure , at her time of life , had been possible to the nice tone of her mind , the fastidiousness of her taste , in the small limits of the society around them . She had been solicited , when about two - and - twenty , to change her name , by the young man , who not long afterwards found a more willing mind in her younger sister ; and Lady Russell had lamented her refusal ; for Charles Musgrove was the eldest son of a man , whose landed property and general importance were second in that country , only to Sir Walter ' s , and of good character and appearance ; and however Lady Russell might have asked yet for something more , while Anne was nineteen , she would have rejoiced to see her at twenty - two so respectably removed from the partialities and injustice of her father ' s house , and settled so permanently near herself . But in this case , Anne had left nothing for advice to do ; and though Lady Russell , as satisfied as ever with her own discretion , never wished the past undone , she began now to have the anxiety which borders on hopelessness for Anne ' s being tempted , by some man of talents and independence , to enter a state for which she held her to be peculiarly fitted by her warm affections and domestic habits .
austen#They knew not each other ' s opinion , either its constancy or its change , on the one leading point of Anne ' s conduct , for the subject was never alluded to ; but Anne , at seven - and - twenty , thought very differently from what she had been made to think at nineteen . She did not blame Lady Russell , she did not blame herself for having been guided by her ; but she felt that were any young person , in similar circumstances , to apply to her for counsel , they would never receive any of such certain immediate wretchedness , such uncertain future good . She was persuaded that under every disadvantage of disapprobation at home , and every anxiety attending his profession , all their probable fears , delays , and disappointments , she should yet have been a happier woman in maintaining the engagement , than she had been in the sacrifice of it ; and this , she fully believed , had the usual share , had even more than the usual share of all such solicitudes and suspense been theirs , without reference to the actual results of their case , which , as it happened , would have bestowed earlier prosperity than could be reasonably calculated on . All his sanguine expectations , all his confidence had been justified . His genius and ardour had seemed to foresee and to command his prosperous path . He had , very soon after their engagement ceased , got employ : and all that he had told her would follow , had taken place .
austen#He had distinguished himself , and early gained the other step in rank , and must now , by successive captures , have made a handsome fortune . She had only navy lists and newspapers for her authority , but she could not doubt his being rich ; and , in favour of his constancy , she had no reason to believe him married . How eloquent could Anne Elliot have been ! how eloquent , at least , were her wishes on the side of early warm attachment , and a cheerful confidence in futurity , against that over - anxious caution which seems to insult exertion and distrust Providence ! She had been forced into prudence in her youth , she learned romance as she grew older : the natural sequel of an unnatural beginning . With all these circumstances , recollections and feelings , she could not hear that Captain Wentworth ' s sister was likely to live at Kellynch without a revival of former pain ; and many a stroll , and many a sigh , were necessary to dispel the agitation of the idea .
austen#She often told herself it was folly , before she could harden her nerves sufficiently to feel the continual discussion of the Crofts and their business no evil . She was assisted , however , by that perfect indifference and apparent unconsciousness , among the only three of her own friends in the secret of the past , which seemed almost to deny any recollection of it . She could do justice to the superiority of Lady Russell ' s motives in this , over those of her father and Elizabeth ; she could honour all the better feelings of her calmness ; but the general air of oblivion among them was highly important from whatever it sprung ; and in the event of Admiral Croft ' s really taking Kellynch Hall , she rejoiced anew over the conviction which had always been most grateful to her , of the past being known to those three only among her connexions , by whom no syllable , she believed , would ever be whispered , and in the trust that among his , the brother only with whom he had been residing , had received any information of their short - lived engagement . That brother had been long removed from the country and being a sensible man , and , moreover , a single man at the time , she had a fond dependence on no human creature ' s having heard of it from him . The sister , Mrs Croft , had then been out of England , accompanying her husband on a foreign station , and her own sister , Mary , had been at school while it all occurred ; and never admitted by the pride of some , and the delicacy of others , to the smallest knowledge of it afterwards . With these supports , she hoped that the acquaintance between herself and the Crofts , which , with Lady Russell , still resident in Kellynch , and Mary fixed only three miles off , must be anticipated , need not involve any particular awkwardness .
austen#"Chapter 5 On the morning appointed for Admiral and Mrs Croft ' s seeing Kellynch Hall , Anne found it most natural to take her almost daily walk to Lady Russell ' s , and keep out of the way till all was over ; when she found it most natural to be sorry that she had missed the opportunity of seeing them . This meeting of the two parties proved highly satisfactory , and decided the whole business at once . Each lady was previously well disposed for an agreement , and saw nothing , therefore , but good manners in the other ; and with regard to the gentlemen , there was such an hearty good humour , such an open , trusting liberality on the Admiral ' s side , as could not but influence Sir Walter , who had besides been flattered into his very best and most polished behaviour by Mr Shepherd ' s assurances of his being known , by report , to the Admiral , as a model of good breeding . The house and grounds , and furniture , were approved , the Crofts were approved , terms , time , every thing , and every body , was right ; and Mr Shepherd ' s clerks were set to work , without there having been a single preliminary difference to modify of all that "" This indenture sheweth ."" Sir Walter , without hesitation , declared the Admiral to be the best - looking sailor he had ever met with , and went so far as to say , that if his own man might have had the arranging of his hair , he should not be ashamed of being seen with him any where ; and the Admiral , with sympathetic cordiality , observed to his wife as they drove back through the park , "" I thought we should soon come to a deal , my dear , in spite of what they told us at Taunton ."
austen#"The Baronet will never set the Thames on fire , but there seems to be no harm in him ."" reciprocal compliments , which would have been esteemed about equal . The Crofts were to have possession at Michaelmas ; and as Sir Walter proposed removing to Bath in the course of the preceding month , there was no time to be lost in making every dependent arrangement . Lady Russell , convinced that Anne would not be allowed to be of any use , or any importance , in the choice of the house which they were going to secure , was very unwilling to have her hurried away so soon , and wanted to make it possible for her to stay behind till she might convey her to Bath herself after Christmas ; but having engagements of her own which must take her from Kellynch for several weeks , she was unable to give the full invitation she wished , and Anne though dreading the possible heats of September in all the white glare of Bath , and grieving to forego all the influence so sweet and so sad of the autumnal months in the country , did not think that , everything considered , she wished to remain . It would be most right , and most wise , and , therefore must involve least suffering to go with the others . Something occurred , however , to give her a different duty ."
austen#"Mary , often a little unwell , and always thinking a great deal of her own complaints , and always in the habit of claiming Anne when anything was the matter , was indisposed ; and foreseeing that she should not have a day ' s health all the autumn , entreated , or rather required her , for it was hardly entreaty , to come to Uppercross Cottage , and bear her company as long as she should want her , instead of going to Bath . "" I cannot possibly do without Anne ,"" was Mary ' s reasoning ; and Elizabeth ' s reply was , "" Then I am sure Anne had better stay , for nobody will want her in Bath ."" To be claimed as a good , though in an improper style , is at least better than being rejected as no good at all ; and Anne , glad to be thought of some use , glad to have anything marked out as a duty , and certainly not sorry to have the scene of it in the country , and her own dear country , readily agreed to stay . This invitation of Mary ' s removed all Lady Russell ' s difficulties , and it was consequently soon settled that Anne should not go to Bath till Lady Russell took her , and that all the intervening time should be divided between Uppercross Cottage and Kellynch Lodge . So far all was perfectly right ; but Lady Russell was almost startled by the wrong of one part of the Kellynch Hall plan , when it burst on her , which was , Mrs Clay ' s being engaged to go to Bath with Sir Walter and Elizabeth , as a most important and valuable assistant to the latter in all the business before her . Lady Russell was extremely sorry that such a measure should have been resorted to at all , wondered , grieved , and feared ; and the affront it contained to Anne , in Mrs Clay ' s being of so much use , while Anne could be of none , was a very sore aggravation ."
austen#Anne herself was become hardened to such affronts ; but she felt the imprudence of the arrangement quite as keenly as Lady Russell . With a great deal of quiet observation , and a knowledge , which she often wished less , of her father ' s character , she was sensible that results the most serious to his family from the intimacy were more than possible . She did not imagine that her father had at present an idea of the kind . Mrs Clay had freckles , and a projecting tooth , and a clumsy wrist , which he was continually making severe remarks upon , in her absence ; but she was young , and certainly altogether well - looking , and possessed , in an acute mind and assiduous pleasing manners , infinitely more dangerous attractions than any merely personal might have been . Anne was so impressed by the degree of their danger , that she could not excuse herself from trying to make it perceptible to her sister . She had little hope of success ; but Elizabeth , who in the event of such a reverse would be so much more to be pitied than herself , should never , she thought , have reason to reproach her for giving no warning .
austen#"She spoke , and seemed only to offend . Elizabeth could not conceive how such an absurd suspicion should occur to her , and indignantly answered for each party ' s perfectly knowing their situation . "" Mrs Clay ,"" said she , warmly , "" never forgets who she is ; and as I am rather better acquainted with her sentiments than you can be , I can assure you , that upon the subject of marriage they are particularly nice , and that she reprobates all inequality of condition and rank more strongly than most people . And as to my father , I really should not have thought that he , who has kept himself single so long for our sakes , need be suspected now . If Mrs Clay were a very beautiful woman , I grant you , it might be wrong to have her so much with me ; not that anything in the world , I am sure , would induce my father to make a degrading match , but he might be rendered unhappy . But poor Mrs Clay who , with all her merits , can never have been reckoned tolerably pretty , I really think poor Mrs Clay may be staying here in perfect safety ."
austen#"One would imagine you had never heard my father speak of her personal misfortunes , though I know you must fifty times . That tooth of her ' s and those freckles . Freckles do not disgust me so very much as they do him . I have known a face not materially disfigured by a few , but he abominates them . You must have heard him notice Mrs Clay ' s freckles ."" "" There is hardly any personal defect ,"" replied Anne , "" which an agreeable manner might not gradually reconcile one to ."""
austen#""" I think very differently ,"" answered Elizabeth , shortly ; "" an agreeable manner may set off handsome features , but can never alter plain ones . However , at any rate , as I have a great deal more at stake on this point than anybody else can have , I think it rather unnecessary in you to be advising me ."" Anne had done ; glad that it was over , and not absolutely hopeless of doing good . Elizabeth , though resenting the suspicion , might yet be made observant by it . The last office of the four carriage - horses was to draw Sir Walter , Miss Elliot , and Mrs Clay to Bath . The party drove off in very good spirits ; Sir Walter prepared with condescending bows for all the afflicted tenantry and cottagers who might have had a hint to show themselves , and Anne walked up at the same time , in a sort of desolate tranquillity , to the Lodge , where she was to spend the first week ."
austen#Her friend was not in better spirits than herself . Lady Russell felt this break - up of the family exceedingly . Their respectability was as dear to her as her own , and a daily intercourse had become precious by habit . It was painful to look upon their deserted grounds , and still worse to anticipate the new hands they were to fall into ; and to escape the solitariness and the melancholy of so altered a village , and be out of the way when Admiral and Mrs Croft first arrived , she had determined to make her own absence from home begin when she must give up Anne . Accordingly their removal was made together , and Anne was set down at Uppercross Cottage , in the first stage of Lady Russell ' s journey . Uppercross was a moderate - sized village , which a few years back had been completely in the old English style , containing only two houses superior in appearance to those of the yeomen and labourers ; the mansion of the squire , with its high walls , great gates , and old trees , substantial and unmodernized , and the compact , tight parsonage , enclosed in its own neat garden , with a vine and a pear - tree trained round its casements ; but upon the marriage of the young ' squire , it had received the improvement of a farm - house elevated into a cottage , for his residence , and Uppercross Cottage , with its veranda , French windows , and other prettiness , was quite as likely to catch the traveller ' s eye as the more consistent and considerable aspect and premises of the Great House , about a quarter of a mile farther on .
austen#Here Anne had often been staying . She knew the ways of Uppercross as well as those of Kellynch . The two families were so continually meeting , so much in the habit of running in and out of each other ' s house at all hours , that it was rather a surprise to her to find Mary alone ; but being alone , her being unwell and out of spirits was almost a matter of course . Though better endowed than the elder sister , Mary had not Anne ' s understanding nor temper . While well , and happy , and properly attended to , she had great good humour and excellent spirits ; but any indisposition sunk her completely . She had no resources for solitude ; and inheriting a considerable share of the Elliot self - importance , was very prone to add to every other distress that of fancying herself neglected and ill - used .
austen#"In person , she was inferior to both sisters , and had , even in her bloom , only reached the dignity of being "" a fine girl ."" She was now lying on the faded sofa of the pretty little drawing - room , the once elegant furniture of which had been gradually growing shabby , under the influence of four summers and two children ; and , on Anne ' s appearing , greeted her with -- "" So , you are come at last ! I began to think I should never see you . I am so ill I can hardly speak . I have not seen a creature the whole morning !"""
austen#""" I am sorry to find you unwell ,"" replied Anne . "" You sent me such a good account of yourself on Thursday !"" "" Yes , I made the best of it ; I always do : but I was very far from well at the time ; and I do not think I ever was so ill in my life as I have been all this morning : very unfit to be left alone , I am sure . Suppose I were to be seized of a sudden in some dreadful way , and not able to ring the bell ! So , Lady Russell would not get out . I do not think she has been in this house three times this summer ."""
austen#"Anne said what was proper , and enquired after her husband . "" Oh ! Charles is out shooting . I have not seen him since seven o ' clock . He would go , though I told him how ill I was . He said he should not stay out long ; but he has never come back , and now it is almost one ."
austen#"I assure you , I have not seen a soul this whole long morning ."" "" You have had your little boys with you ?"" "" Yes , as long as I could bear their noise ; but they are so unmanageable that they do me more harm than good . Little Charles does not mind a word I say , and Walter is growing quite as bad ."" "" Well , you will soon be better now ,"" replied Anne , cheerfully . "" You know I always cure you when I come ."
austen#"How are your neighbours at the Great House ?"" "" I can give you no account of them . I have not seen one of them to - day , except Mr Musgrove , who just stopped and spoke through the window , but without getting off his horse ; and though I told him how ill I was , not one of them have been near me . It did not happen to suit the Miss Musgroves , I suppose , and they never put themselves out of their way ."" "" You will see them yet , perhaps , before the morning is gone . It is early ."""
austen#""" I never want them , I assure you . They talk and laugh a great deal too much for me . Oh ! Anne , I am so very unwell ! It was quite unkind of you not to come on Thursday ."" "" My dear Mary , recollect what a comfortable account you sent me of yourself !"
austen#"You wrote in the cheerfullest manner , and said you were perfectly well , and in no hurry for me ; and that being the case , you must be aware that my wish would be to remain with Lady Russell to the last : and besides what I felt on her account , I have really been so busy , have had so much to do , that I could not very conveniently have left Kellynch sooner ."" "" Dear me ! what can you possibly have to do ?"" "" A great many things , I assure you . More than I can recollect in a moment ; but I can tell you some . I have been making a duplicate of the catalogue of my father ' s books and pictures ."
austen#"I have been several times in the garden with Mackenzie , trying to understand , and make him understand , which of Elizabeth ' s plants are for Lady Russell . I have had all my own little concerns to arrange , books and music to divide , and all my trunks to repack , from not having understood in time what was intended as to the waggons : and one thing I have had to do , Mary , of a more trying nature : going to almost every house in the parish , as a sort of take - leave . I was told that they wished it . But all these things took up a great deal of time ."" "" Oh ! well !"""
austen#"and after a moment ' s pause , "" but you have never asked me one word about our dinner at the Pooles yesterday ."" "" Did you go then ? I have made no enquiries , because I concluded you must have been obliged to give up the party ."" "" Oh yes ! I went . I was very well yesterday ; nothing at all the matter with me till this morning ."
austen#"It would have been strange if I had not gone ."" "" I am very glad you were well enough , and I hope you had a pleasant party ."" "" Nothing remarkable . One always knows beforehand what the dinner will be , and who will be there ; and it is so very uncomfortable not having a carriage of one ' s own . Mr and Mrs Musgrove took me , and we were so crowded ! They are both so very large , and take up so much room ; and Mr Musgrove always sits forward ."
austen#"So , there was I , crowded into the back seat with Henrietta and Louise ; and I think it very likely that my illness to - day may be owing to it ."" A little further perseverance in patience and forced cheerfulness on Anne ' s side produced nearly a cure on Mary ' s . She could soon sit upright on the sofa , and began to hope she might be able to leave it by dinner - time . Then , forgetting to think of it , she was at the other end of the room , beautifying a nosegay ; then , she ate her cold meat ; and then she was well enough to propose a little walk . "" Where shall we go ?"" said she , when they were ready ."
austen#""" I suppose you will not like to call at the Great House before they have been to see you ?"" "" I have not the smallest objection on that account ,"" replied Anne . "" I should never think of standing on such ceremony with people I know so well as Mrs and the Miss Musgroves ."" "" Oh ! but they ought to call upon you as soon as possible . They ought to feel what is due to you as my sister ."
austen#"However , we may as well go and sit with them a little while , and when we have that over , we can enjoy our walk ."" Anne had always thought such a style of intercourse highly imprudent ; but she had ceased to endeavour to check it , from believing that , though there were on each side continual subjects of offence , neither family could now do without it . To the Great House accordingly they went , to sit the full half hour in the old - fashioned square parlour , with a small carpet and shining floor , to which the present daughters of the house were gradually giving the proper air of confusion by a grand piano - forte and a harp , flower - stands and little tables placed in every direction . Oh ! could the originals of the portraits against the wainscot , could the gentlemen in brown velvet and the ladies in blue satin have seen what was going on , have been conscious of such an overthrow of all order and neatness ! The portraits themselves seemed to be staring in astonishment ."
austen#The Musgroves , like their houses , were in a state of alteration , perhaps of improvement . The father and mother were in the old English style , and the young people in the new . Mr and Mrs Musgrove were a very good sort of people ; friendly and hospitable , not much educated , and not at all elegant . Their children had more modern minds and manners . There was a numerous family ; but the only two grown up , excepting Charles , were Henrietta and Louisa , young ladies of nineteen and twenty , who had brought from school at Exeter all the usual stock of accomplishments , and were now like thousands of other young ladies , living to be fashionable , happy , and merry . Their dress had every advantage , their faces were rather pretty , their spirits extremely good , their manner unembarrassed and pleasant ; they were of consequence at home , and favourites abroad .
austen#Anne always contemplated them as some of the happiest creatures of her acquaintance ; but still , saved as we all are , by some comfortable feeling of superiority from wishing for the possibility of exchange , she would not have given up her own more elegant and cultivated mind for all their enjoyments ; and envied them nothing but that seemingly perfect good understanding and agreement together , that good - humoured mutual affection , of which she had known so little herself with either of her sisters . They were received with great cordiality . Nothing seemed amiss on the side of the Great House family , which was generally , as Anne very well knew , the least to blame . The half hour was chatted away pleasantly enough ; and she was not at all surprised at the end of it , to have their walking party joined by both the Miss Musgroves , at Mary ' s particular invitation . Chapter 6 Anne had not wanted this visit to Uppercross , to learn that a removal from one set of people to another , though at a distance of only three miles , will often include a total change of conversation , opinion , and idea .
austen#"She had never been staying there before , without being struck by it , or without wishing that other Elliots could have her advantage in seeing how unknown , or unconsidered there , were the affairs which at Kellynch Hall were treated as of such general publicity and pervading interest ; yet , with all this experience , she believed she must now submit to feel that another lesson , in the art of knowing our own nothingness beyond our own circle , was become necessary for her ; for certainly , coming as she did , with a heart full of the subject which had been completely occupying both houses in Kellynch for many weeks , she had expected rather more curiosity and sympathy than she found in the separate but very similar remark of Mr and Mrs Musgrove : "" So , Miss Anne , Sir Walter and your sister are gone ; and what part of Bath do you think they will settle in ?"" and this , without much waiting for an answer ; or in the young ladies ' addition of , "" I hope we shall be in Bath in the winter ; but remember , papa , if we do go , we must be in a good situation : none of your Queen Squares for us !"" or in the anxious supplement from Mary , of -- "" Upon my word , I shall be pretty well off , when you are all gone away to be happy at Bath !"" She could only resolve to avoid such self - delusion in future , and think with heightened gratitude of the extraordinary blessing of having one such truly sympathising friend as Lady Russell . The Mr Musgroves had their own game to guard , and to destroy , their own horses , dogs , and newspapers to engage them , and the females were fully occupied in all the other common subjects of housekeeping , neighbours , dress , dancing , and music . She acknowledged it to be very fitting , that every little social commonwealth should dictate its own matters of discourse ; and hoped , ere long , to become a not unworthy member of the one she was now transplanted into ."
austen#With the prospect of spending at least two months at Uppercross , it was highly incumbent on her to clothe her imagination , her memory , and all her ideas in as much of Uppercross as possible . She had no dread of these two months . Mary was not so repulsive and unsisterly as Elizabeth , nor so inaccessible to all influence of hers ; neither was there anything among the other component parts of the cottage inimical to comfort . She was always on friendly terms with her brother - in - law ; and in the children , who loved her nearly as well , and respected her a great deal more than their mother , she had an object of interest , amusement , and wholesome exertion . Charles Musgrove was civil and agreeable ; in sense and temper he was undoubtedly superior to his wife , but not of powers , or conversation , or grace , to make the past , as they were connected together , at all a dangerous contemplation ; though , at the same time , Anne could believe , with Lady Russell , that a more equal match might have greatly improved him ; and that a woman of real understanding might have given more consequence to his character , and more usefulness , rationality , and elegance to his habits and pursuits . As it was , he did nothing with much zeal , but sport ; and his time was otherwise trifled away , without benefit from books or anything else .
austen#"He had very good spirits , which never seemed much affected by his wife ' s occasional lowness , bore with her unreasonableness sometimes to Anne ' s admiration , and upon the whole , though there was very often a little disagreement ( in which she had sometimes more share than she wished , being appealed to by both parties ), they might pass for a happy couple . They were always perfectly agreed in the want of more money , and a strong inclination for a handsome present from his father ; but here , as on most topics , he had the superiority , for while Mary thought it a great shame that such a present was not made , he always contended for his father ' s having many other uses for his money , and a right to spend it as he liked . As to the management of their children , his theory was much better than his wife ' s , and his practice not so bad . "" I could manage them very well , if it were not for Mary ' s interference ,"" was what Anne often heard him say , and had a good deal of faith in ; but when listening in turn to Mary ' s reproach of "" Charles spoils the children so that I cannot get them into any order ,"" she never had the smallest temptation to say , "" Very true ."" One of the least agreeable circumstances of her residence there was her being treated with too much confidence by all parties , and being too much in the secret of the complaints of each house . Known to have some influence with her sister , she was continually requested , or at least receiving hints to exert it , beyond what was practicable ."
austen#""" I wish you could persuade Mary not to be always fancying herself ill ,"" was Charles ' s language ; and , in an unhappy mood , thus spoke Mary : "" I do believe if Charles were to see me dying , he would not think there was anything the matter with me . I am sure , Anne , if you would , you might persuade him that I really am very ill -- a great deal worse than I ever own ."" Mary ' s declaration was , "" I hate sending the children to the Great House , though their grandmamma is always wanting to see them , for she humours and indulges them to such a degree , and gives them so much trash and sweet things , that they are sure to come back sick and cross for the rest of the day ."" And Mrs Musgrove took the first opportunity of being alone with Anne , to say , "" Oh ! Miss Anne , I cannot help wishing Mrs Charles had a little of your method with those children . They are quite different creatures with you !"
austen#But to be sure , in general they are so spoilt ! It is a pity you cannot put your sister in the way of managing them . They are as fine healthy children as ever were seen , poor little dears ! without partiality ; but Mrs Charles knows no more how they should be treated --! Bless me ! how troublesome they are sometimes .
austen#"I assure you , Miss Anne , it prevents my wishing to see them at our house so often as I otherwise should . I believe Mrs Charles is not quite pleased with my not inviting them oftener ; but you know it is very bad to have children with one that one is obligated to be checking every moment ; "" don ' t do this ,"" and "" don ' t do that ;"" or that one can only keep in tolerable order by more cake than is good for them ."" She had this communication , moreover , from Mary . "" Mrs Musgrove thinks all her servants so steady , that it would be high treason to call it in question ; but I am sure , without exaggeration , that her upper house - maid and laundry - maid , instead of being in their business , are gadding about the village , all day long . I meet them wherever I go ; and I declare , I never go twice into my nursery without seeing something of them . If Jemima were not the trustiest , steadiest creature in the world , it would be enough to spoil her ; for she tells me , they are always tempting her to take a walk with them ."""
austen#"And on Mrs Musgrove ' s side , it was , "" I make a rule of never interfering in any of my daughter - in - law ' s concerns , for I know it would not do ; but I shall tell you , Miss Anne , because you may be able to set things to rights , that I have no very good opinion of Mrs Charles ' s nursery - maid : I hear strange stories of her ; she is always upon the gad ; and from my own knowledge , I can declare , she is such a fine - dressing lady , that she is enough to ruin any servants she comes near . Mrs Charles quite swears by her , I know ; but I just give you this hint , that you may be upon the watch ; because , if you see anything amiss , you need not be afraid of mentioning it ."" Again , it was Mary ' s complaint , that Mrs Musgrove was very apt not to give her the precedence that was her due , when they dined at the Great House with other families ; and she did not see any reason why she was to be considered so much at home as to lose her place . And one day when Anne was walking with only the Musgroves , one of them after talking of rank , people of rank , and jealousy of rank , said , "" I have no scruple of observing to you , how nonsensical some persons are about their place , because all the world knows how easy and indifferent you are about it ; but I wish anybody could give Mary a hint that it would be a great deal better if she were not so very tenacious , especially if she would not be always putting herself forward to take place of mamma . Nobody doubts her right to have precedence of mamma , but it would be more becoming in her not to be always insisting on it . It is not that mamma cares about it the least in the world , but I know it is taken notice of by many persons ."""
austen#How was Anne to set all these matters to rights ? She could do little more than listen patiently , soften every grievance , and excuse each to the other ; give them all hints of the forbearance necessary between such near neighbours , and make those hints broadest which were meant for her sister ' s benefit . In all other respects , her visit began and proceeded very well . Her own spirits improved by change of place and subject , by being removed three miles from Kellynch ; Mary ' s ailments lessened by having a constant companion , and their daily intercourse with the other family , since there was neither superior affection , confidence , nor employment in the cottage , to be interrupted by it , was rather an advantage . It was certainly carried nearly as far as possible , for they met every morning , and hardly ever spent an evening asunder ; but she believed they should not have done so well without the sight of Mr and Mrs Musgrove ' s respectable forms in the usual places , or without the talking , laughing , and singing of their daughters . She played a great deal better than either of the Miss Musgroves , but having no voice , no knowledge of the harp , and no fond parents , to sit by and fancy themselves delighted , her performance was little thought of , only out of civility , or to refresh the others , as she was well aware .
austen#She knew that when she played she was giving pleasure only to herself ; but this was no new sensation . Excepting one short period of her life , she had never , since the age of fourteen , never since the loss of her dear mother , known the happiness of being listened to , or encouraged by any just appreciation or real taste . In music she had been always used to feel alone in the world ; and Mr and Mrs Musgrove ' s fond partiality for their own daughters ' performance , and total indifference to any other person ' s , gave her much more pleasure for their sakes , than mortification for her own . The party at the Great House was sometimes increased by other company . The neighbourhood was not large , but the Musgroves were visited by everybody , and had more dinner - parties , and more callers , more visitors by invitation and by chance , than any other family . There were more completely popular .
austen#"The girls were wild for dancing ; and the evenings ended , occasionally , in an unpremeditated little ball . There was a family of cousins within a walk of Uppercross , in less affluent circumstances , who depended on the Musgroves for all their pleasures : they would come at any time , and help play at anything , or dance anywhere ; and Anne , very much preferring the office of musician to a more active post , played country dances to them by the hour together ; a kindness which always recommended her musical powers to the notice of Mr and Mrs Musgrove more than anything else , and often drew this compliment ;-- "" Well done , Miss Anne ! very well done indeed ! Lord bless me ! how those little fingers of yours fly about !"" So passed the first three weeks ."
austen#"Michaelmas came ; and now Anne ' s heart must be in Kellynch again . A beloved home made over to others ; all the precious rooms and furniture , groves , and prospects , beginning to own other eyes and other limbs ! She could not think of much else on the 29th of September ; and she had this sympathetic touch in the evening from Mary , who , on having occasion to note down the day of the month , exclaimed , "" Dear me , is not this the day the Crofts were to come to Kellynch ? I am glad I did not think of it before . How low it makes me !"" The Crofts took possession with true naval alertness , and were to be visited ."
austen#"Mary deplored the necessity for herself . "" Nobody knew how much she should suffer . She should put it off as long as she could ;"" but was not easy till she had talked Charles into driving her over on an early day , and was in a very animated , comfortable state of imaginary agitation , when she came back . Anne had very sincerely rejoiced in there being no means of her going . She wished , however to see the Crofts , and was glad to be within when the visit was returned . They came : the master of the house was not at home , but the two sisters were together ; and as it chanced that Mrs Croft fell to the share of Anne , while the Admiral sat by Mary , and made himself very agreeable by his good - humoured notice of her little boys , she was well able to watch for a likeness , and if it failed her in the features , to catch it in the voice , or in the turn of sentiment and expression ."
austen#"Mrs Croft , though neither tall nor fat , had a squareness , uprightness , and vigour of form , which gave importance to her person . She had bright dark eyes , good teeth , and altogether an agreeable face ; though her reddened and weather - beaten complexion , the consequence of her having been almost as much at sea as her husband , made her seem to have lived some years longer in the world than her real eight - and - thirty . Her manners were open , easy , and decided , like one who had no distrust of herself , and no doubts of what to do ; without any approach to coarseness , however , or any want of good humour . Anne gave her credit , indeed , for feelings of great consideration towards herself , in all that related to Kellynch , and it pleased her : especially , as she had satisfied herself in the very first half minute , in the instant even of introduction , that there was not the smallest symptom of any knowledge or suspicion on Mrs Croft ' s side , to give a bias of any sort . She was quite easy on that head , and consequently full of strength and courage , till for a moment electrified by Mrs Croft ' s suddenly saying ,-- "" It was you , and not your sister , I find , that my brother had the pleasure of being acquainted with , when he was in this country ."""
austen#"Anne hoped she had outlived the age of blushing ; but the age of emotion she certainly had not . "" Perhaps you may not have heard that he is married ?"" added Mrs Croft . She could now answer as she ought ; and was happy to feel , when Mrs Croft ' s next words explained it to be Mr Wentworth of whom she spoke , that she had said nothing which might not do for either brother . She immediately felt how reasonable it was , that Mrs Croft should be thinking and speaking of Edward , and not of Frederick ; and with shame at her own forgetfulness applied herself to the knowledge of their former neighbour ' s present state with proper interest . The rest was all tranquillity ; till , just as they were moving , she heard the Admiral say to Mary --"
austen#""" We are expecting a brother of Mrs Croft ' s here soon ; I dare say you know him by name ."" He was cut short by the eager attacks of the little boys , clinging to him like an old friend , and declaring he should not go ; and being too much engrossed by proposals of carrying them away in his coat pockets , & c ., to have another moment for finishing or recollecting what he had begun , Anne was left to persuade herself , as well as she could , that the same brother must still be in question . She could not , however , reach such a degree of certainty , as not to be anxious to hear whether anything had been said on the subject at the other house , where the Crofts had previously been calling . The folks of the Great House were to spend the evening of this day at the Cottage ; and it being now too late in the year for such visits to be made on foot , the coach was beginning to be listened for , when the youngest Miss Musgrove walked in . That she was coming to apologize , and that they should have to spend the evening by themselves , was the first black idea ; and Mary was quite ready to be affronted , when Louisa made all right by saying , that she only came on foot , to leave more room for the harp , which was bringing in the carriage . "" And I will tell you our reason ,"" she added , "" and all about it ."
austen#I am come on to give you notice , that papa and mamma are out of spirits this evening , especially mamma ; she is thinking so much of poor Richard ! And we agreed it would be best to have the harp , for it seems to amuse her more than the piano - forte . I will tell you why she is out of spirits . When the Crofts called this morning , ( they called here afterwards , did not they ? ), they happened to say , that her brother , Captain Wentworth , is just returned to England , or paid off , or something , and is coming to see them almost directly ; and most unluckily it came into mamma ' s head , when they were gone , that Wentworth , or something very like it , was the name of poor Richard ' s captain at one time ; I do not know when or where , but a great while before he died , poor fellow ! And upon looking over his letters and things , she found it was so , and is perfectly sure that this must be the very man , and her head is quite full of it , and of poor Richard !
austen#"So we must be as merry as we can , that she may not be dwelling upon such gloomy things ."" The real circumstances of this pathetic piece of family history were , that the Musgroves had had the ill fortune of a very troublesome , hopeless son ; and the good fortune to lose him before he reached his twentieth year ; that he had been sent to sea because he was stupid and unmanageable on shore ; that he had been very little cared for at any time by his family , though quite as much as he deserved ; seldom heard of , and scarcely at all regretted , when the intelligence of his death abroad had worked its way to Uppercross , two years before . He had , in fact , though his sisters were now doing all they could for him , by calling him "" poor Richard ,"" been nothing better than a thick - headed , unfeeling , unprofitable Dick Musgrove , who had never done anything to entitle himself to more than the abbreviation of his name , living or dead . He had been several years at sea , and had , in the course of those removals to which all midshipmen are liable , and especially such midshipmen as every captain wishes to get rid of , been six months on board Captain Frederick Wentworth ' s frigate , the Laconia ; and from the Laconia he had , under the influence of his captain , written the only two letters which his father and mother had ever received from him during the whole of his absence ; that is to say , the only two disinterested letters ; all the rest had been mere applications for money . In each letter he had spoken well of his captain ; but yet , so little were they in the habit of attending to such matters , so unobservant and incurious were they as to the names of men or ships , that it had made scarcely any impression at the time ; and that Mrs Musgrove should have been suddenly struck , this very day , with a recollection of the name of Wentworth , as connected with her son , seemed one of those extraordinary bursts of mind which do sometimes occur . She had gone to her letters , and found it all as she supposed ; and the re - perusal of these letters , after so long an interval , her poor son gone for ever , and all the strength of his faults forgotten , had affected her spirits exceedingly , and thrown her into greater grief for him than she had know on first hearing of his death ."
austen#"Mr Musgrove was , in a lesser degree , affected likewise ; and when they reached the cottage , they were evidently in want , first , of being listened to anew on this subject , and afterwards , of all the relief which cheerful companions could give them . To hear them talking so much of Captain Wentworth , repeating his name so often , puzzling over past years , and at last ascertaining that it might , that it probably would , turn out to be the very same Captain Wentworth whom they recollected meeting , once or twice , after their coming back from Clifton -- a very fine young man -- but they could not say whether it was seven or eight years ago , was a new sort of trial to Anne ' s nerves . She found , however , that it was one to which she must inure herself . Since he actually was expected in the country , she must teach herself to be insensible on such points . And not only did it appear that he was expected , and speedily , but the Musgroves , in their warm gratitude for the kindness he had shewn poor Dick , and very high respect for his character , stamped as it was by poor Dick ' s having been six months under his care , and mentioning him in strong , though not perfectly well - spelt praise , as "" a fine dashing felow , only two perticular about the schoolmaster ,"" were bent on introducing themselves , and seeking his acquaintance , as soon as they could hear of his arrival . The resolution of doing so helped to form the comfort of their evening ."
austen#Chapter 7 A very few days more , and Captain Wentworth was known to be at Kellynch , and Mr Musgrove had called on him , and come back warm in his praise , and he was engaged with the Crofts to dine at Uppercross , by the end of another week . It had been a great disappointment to Mr Musgrove to find that no earlier day could be fixed , so impatient was he to shew his gratitude , by seeing Captain Wentworth under his own roof , and welcoming him to all that was strongest and best in his cellars . But a week must pass ; only a week , in Anne ' s reckoning , and then , she supposed , they must meet ; and soon she began to wish that she could feel secure even for a week . Captain Wentworth made a very early return to Mr Musgrove ' s civility , and she was all but calling there in the same half hour . She and Mary were actually setting forward for the Great House , where , as she afterwards learnt , they must inevitably have found him , when they were stopped by the eldest boy ' s being at that moment brought home in consequence of a bad fall .
austen#The child ' s situation put the visit entirely aside ; but she could not hear of her escape with indifference , even in the midst of the serious anxiety which they afterwards felt on his account . His collar - bone was found to be dislocated , and such injury received in the back , as roused the most alarming ideas . It was an afternoon of distress , and Anne had every thing to do at once ; the apothecary to send for , the father to have pursued and informed , the mother to support and keep from hysterics , the servants to control , the youngest child to banish , and the poor suffering one to attend and soothe ; besides sending , as soon as she recollected it , proper notice to the other house , which brought her an accession rather of frightened , enquiring companions , than of very useful assistants . Her brother ' s return was the first comfort ; he could take best care of his wife ; and the second blessing was the arrival of the apothecary . Till he came and had examined the child , their apprehensions were the worse for being vague ; they suspected great injury , but knew not where ; but now the collar - bone was soon replaced , and though Mr Robinson felt and felt , and rubbed , and looked grave , and spoke low words both to the father and the aunt , still they were all to hope the best , and to be able to part and eat their dinner in tolerable ease of mind ; and then it was , just before they parted , that the two young aunts were able so far to digress from their nephew ' s state , as to give the information of Captain Wentworth ' s visit ; staying five minutes behind their father and mother , to endeavour to express how perfectly delighted they were with him , how much handsomer , how infinitely more agreeable they thought him than any individual among their male acquaintance , who had been at all a favourite before . How glad they had been to hear papa invite him to stay dinner , how sorry when he said it was quite out of his power , and how glad again when he had promised in reply to papa and mamma ' s farther pressing invitations to come and dine with them on the morrow -- actually on the morrow ; and he had promised it in so pleasant a manner , as if he felt all the motive of their attention just as he ought .
austen#"And in short , he had looked and said everything with such exquisite grace , that they could assure them all , their heads were both turned by him ; and off they ran , quite as full of glee as of love , and apparently more full of Captain Wentworth than of little Charles . The same story and the same raptures were repeated , when the two girls came with their father , through the gloom of the evening , to make enquiries ; and Mr Musgrove , no longer under the first uneasiness about his heir , could add his confirmation and praise , and hope there would be now no occasion for putting Captain Wentworth off , and only be sorry to think that the cottage party , probably , would not like to leave the little boy , to give him the meeting . "" Oh no ; as to leaving the little boy ,"" both father and mother were in much too strong and recent alarm to bear the thought ; and Anne , in the joy of the escape , could not help adding her warm protestations to theirs . Charles Musgrove , indeed , afterwards , shewed more of inclination ; "" the child was going on so well , and he wished so much to be introduced to Captain Wentworth , that , perhaps , he might join them in the evening ; he would not dine from home , but he might walk in for half an hour ."" But in this he was eagerly opposed by his wife , with "" Oh ! no , indeed , Charles , I cannot bear to have you go away ."
austen#"Only think if anything should happen ?"" The child had a good night , and was going on well the next day . It must be a work of time to ascertain that no injury had been done to the spine ; but Mr Robinson found nothing to increase alarm , and Charles Musgrove began , consequently , to feel no necessity for longer confinement . The child was to be kept in bed and amused as quietly as possible ; but what was there for a father to do ? This was quite a female case , and it would be highly absurd in him , who could be of no use at home , to shut himself up . His father very much wished him to meet Captain Wentworth , and there being no sufficient reason against it , he ought to go ; and it ended in his making a bold , public declaration , when he came in from shooting , of his meaning to dress directly , and dine at the other house ."
austen#""" Nothing can be going on better than the child ,"" said he ; "" so I told my father , just now , that I would come , and he thought me quite right . Your sister being with you , my love , I have no scruple at all . You would not like to leave him yourself , but you see I can be of no use . Anne will send for me if anything is the matter ."" Husbands and wives generally understand when opposition will be vain . Mary knew , from Charles ' s manner of speaking , that he was quite determined on going , and that it would be of no use to teaze him ."
austen#"She said nothing , therefore , till he was out of the room , but as soon as there was only Anne to hear -- "" So you and I are to be left to shift by ourselves , with this poor sick child ; and not a creature coming near us all the evening ! I knew how it would be . This is always my luck . If there is anything disagreeable going on men are always sure to get out of it , and Charles is as bad as any of them . Very unfeeling !"
austen#I must say it is very unfeeling of him to be running away from his poor little boy . Talks of his being going on so well ! How does he know that he is going on well , or that there may not be a sudden change half an hour hence ? I did not think Charles would have been so unfeeling . So here he is to go away and enjoy himself , and because I am the poor mother , I am not to be allowed to stir ; and yet , I am sure , I am more unfit than anybody else to be about the child . My being the mother is the very reason why my feelings should not be tried .
austen#"I am not at all equal to it . You saw how hysterical I was yesterday ."" "" But that was only the effect of the suddenness of your alarm -- of the shock . You will not be hysterical again . I dare say we shall have nothing to distress us . I perfectly understand Mr Robinson ' s directions , and have no fears ; and indeed , Mary , I cannot wonder at your husband ."
austen#"Nursing does not belong to a man ; it is not his province . A sick child is always the mother ' s property : her own feelings generally make it so ."" "" I hope I am as fond of my child as any mother , but I do not know that I am of any more use in the sick - room than Charles , for I cannot be always scolding and teazing the poor child when it is ill ; and you saw , this morning , that if I told him to keep quiet , he was sure to begin kicking about . I have not nerves for the sort of thing ."" "" But , could you be comfortable yourself , to be spending the whole evening away from the poor boy ?"" "" Yes ; you see his papa can , and why should not I ?"
austen#"Jemima is so careful ; and she could send us word every hour how he was . I really think Charles might as well have told his father we would all come . I am not more alarmed about little Charles now than he is . I was dreadfully alarmed yesterday , but the case is very different to - day ."" "" Well , if you do not think it too late to give notice for yourself , suppose you were to go , as well as your husband . Leave little Charles to my care ."
austen#"Mr and Mrs Musgrove cannot think it wrong while I remain with him ."" "" Are you serious ?"" cried Mary , her eyes brightening . "" Dear me ! that ' s a very good thought , very good , indeed . To be sure , I may just as well go as not , for I am of no use at home -- am I ?"
austen#and it only harasses me . You , who have not a mother ' s feelings , are a great deal the properest person . You can make little Charles do anything ; he always minds you at a word . It will be a great deal better than leaving him only with Jemima . Oh ! I shall certainly go ; I am sure I ought if I can , quite as much as Charles , for they want me excessively to be acquainted with Captain Wentworth , and I know you do not mind being left alone .
austen#"An excellent thought of yours , indeed , Anne . I will go and tell Charles , and get ready directly . You can send for us , you know , at a moment ' s notice , if anything is the matter ; but I dare say there will be nothing to alarm you . I should not go , you may be sure , if I did not feel quite at ease about my dear child ."" The next moment she was tapping at her husband ' s dressing - room door , and as Anne followed her up stairs , she was in time for the whole conversation , which began with Mary ' s saying , in a tone of great exultation -- "" I mean to go with you , Charles , for I am of no more use at home than you are ."
austen#"If I were to shut myself up for ever with the child , I should not be able to persuade him to do anything he did not like . Anne will stay ; Anne undertakes to stay at home and take care of him . It is Anne ' s own proposal , and so I shall go with you , which will be a great deal better , for I have not dined at the other house since Tuesday ."" "" This is very kind of Anne ,"" was her husband ' s answer , "" and I should be very glad to have you go ; but it seems rather hard that she should be left at home by herself , to nurse our sick child ."" Anne was now at hand to take up her own cause , and the sincerity of her manner being soon sufficient to convince him , where conviction was at least very agreeable , he had no farther scruples as to her being left to dine alone , though he still wanted her to join them in the evening , when the child might be at rest for the night , and kindly urged her to let him come and fetch her , but she was quite unpersuadable ; and this being the case , she had ere long the pleasure of seeing them set off together in high spirits . They were gone , she hoped , to be happy , however oddly constructed such happiness might seem ; as for herself , she was left with as many sensations of comfort , as were , perhaps , ever likely to be hers ."
austen#She knew herself to be of the first utility to the child ; and what was it to her if Frederick Wentworth were only half a mile distant , making himself agreeable to others ? She would have liked to know how he felt as to a meeting . Perhaps indifferent , if indifference could exist under such circumstances . He must be either indifferent or unwilling . Had he wished ever to see her again , he need not have waited till this time ; he would have done what she could not but believe that in his place she should have done long ago , when events had been early giving him the independence which alone had been wanting . Her brother and sister came back delighted with their new acquaintance , and their visit in general .
austen#There had been music , singing , talking , laughing , all that was most agreeable ; charming manners in Captain Wentworth , no shyness or reserve ; they seemed all to know each other perfectly , and he was coming the very next morning to shoot with Charles . He was to come to breakfast , but not at the Cottage , though that had been proposed at first ; but then he had been pressed to come to the Great House instead , and he seemed afraid of being in Mrs Charles Musgrove ' s way , on account of the child , and therefore , somehow , they hardly knew how , it ended in Charles ' s being to meet him to breakfast at his father ' s . Anne understood it . He wished to avoid seeing her . He had inquired after her , she found , slightly , as might suit a former slight acquaintance , seeming to acknowledge such as she had acknowledged , actuated , perhaps , by the same view of escaping introduction when they were to meet . The morning hours of the Cottage were always later than those of the other house , and on the morrow the difference was so great that Mary and Anne were not more than beginning breakfast when Charles came in to say that they were just setting off , that he was come for his dogs , that his sisters were following with Captain Wentworth ; his sisters meaning to visit Mary and the child , and Captain Wentworth proposing also to wait on her for a few minutes if not inconvenient ; and though Charles had answered for the child ' s being in no such state as could make it inconvenient , Captain Wentworth would not be satisfied without his running on to give notice .
austen#"Mary , very much gratified by this attention , was delighted to receive him , while a thousand feelings rushed on Anne , of which this was the most consoling , that it would soon be over . And it was soon over . In two minutes after Charles ' s preparation , the others appeared ; they were in the drawing - room . Her eye half met Captain Wentworth ' s , a bow , a curtsey passed ; she heard his voice ; he talked to Mary , said all that was right , said something to the Miss Musgroves , enough to mark an easy footing ; the room seemed full , full of persons and voices , but a few minutes ended it . Charles shewed himself at the window , all was ready , their visitor had bowed and was gone , the Miss Musgroves were gone too , suddenly resolving to walk to the end of the village with the sportsmen : the room was cleared , and Anne might finish her breakfast as she could . "" It is over !"
austen#"it is over !"" she repeated to herself again and again , in nervous gratitude . "" The worst is over !"" Mary talked , but she could not attend . She had seen him . They had met ."
austen#They had been once more in the same room . Soon , however , she began to reason with herself , and try to be feeling less . Eight years , almost eight years had passed , since all had been given up . How absurd to be resuming the agitation which such an interval had banished into distance and indistinctness ! What might not eight years do ? Events of every description , changes , alienations , removals -- all , all must be comprised in it , and oblivion of the past -- how natural , how certain too !
austen#It included nearly a third part of her own life . Alas ! with all her reasoning , she found , that to retentive feelings eight years may be little more than nothing . Now , how were his sentiments to be read ? Was this like wishing to avoid her ? And the next moment she was hating herself for the folly which asked the question .
austen#"On one other question which perhaps her utmost wisdom might not have prevented , she was soon spared all suspense ; for , after the Miss Musgroves had returned and finished their visit at the Cottage she had this spontaneous information from Mary : -- "" Captain Wentworth is not very gallant by you , Anne , though he was so attentive to me . Henrietta asked him what he thought of you , when they went away , and he said , ` You were so altered he should not have known you again .'"" Mary had no feelings to make her respect her sister ' s in a common way , but she was perfectly unsuspicious of being inflicting any peculiar wound . "" Altered beyond his knowledge ."" Anne fully submitted , in silent , deep mortification ."
austen#"Doubtless it was so , and she could take no revenge , for he was not altered , or not for the worse . She had already acknowledged it to herself , and she could not think differently , let him think of her as he would . No : the years which had destroyed her youth and bloom had only given him a more glowing , manly , open look , in no respect lessening his personal advantages . She had seen the same Frederick Wentworth . "" So altered that he should not have known her again !"" These were words which could not but dwell with her ."
austen#Yet she soon began to rejoice that she had heard them . They were of sobering tendency ; they allayed agitation ; they composed , and consequently must make her happier . Frederick Wentworth had used such words , or something like them , but without an idea that they would be carried round to her . He had thought her wretchedly altered , and in the first moment of appeal , had spoken as he felt . He had not forgiven Anne Elliot . She had used him ill , deserted and disappointed him ; and worse , she had shewn a feebleness of character in doing so , which his own decided , confident temper could not endure .
austen#She had given him up to oblige others . It had been the effect of over - persuasion . It had been weakness and timidity . He had been most warmly attached to her , and had never seen a woman since whom he thought her equal ; but , except from some natural sensation of curiosity , he had no desire of meeting her again . Her power with him was gone for ever . It was now his object to marry .
austen#"He was rich , and being turned on shore , fully intended to settle as soon as he could be properly tempted ; actually looking round , ready to fall in love with all the speed which a clear head and a quick taste could allow . He had a heart for either of the Miss Musgroves , if they could catch it ; a heart , in short , for any pleasing young woman who came in his way , excepting Anne Elliot . This was his only secret exception , when he said to his sister , in answer to her suppositions :-- "" Yes , here I am , Sophia , quite ready to make a foolish match . Anybody between fifteen and thirty may have me for asking . A little beauty , and a few smiles , and a few compliments to the navy , and I am a lost man ."
austen#"Should not this be enough for a sailor , who has had no society among women to make him nice ?"" He said it , she knew , to be contradicted . His bright proud eye spoke the conviction that he was nice ; and Anne Elliot was not out of his thoughts , when he more seriously described the woman he should wish to meet with . "" A strong mind , with sweetness of manner ,"" made the first and the last of the description . "" That is the woman I want ,"" said he . "" Something a little inferior I shall of course put up with , but it must not be much ."
austen#"If I am a fool , I shall be a fool indeed , for I have thought on the subject more than most men ."" Chapter 8 From this time Captain Wentworth and Anne Elliot were repeatedly in the same circle . They were soon dining in company together at Mr Musgrove ' s , for the little boy ' s state could no longer supply his aunt with a pretence for absenting herself ; and this was but the beginning of other dinings and other meetings . Whether former feelings were to be renewed must be brought to the proof ; former times must undoubtedly be brought to the recollection of each ; they could not but be reverted to ; the year of their engagement could not but be named by him , in the little narratives or descriptions which conversation called forth . His profession qualified him , his disposition lead him , to talk ; and "" That was in the year six ;"" "" That happened before I went to sea in the year six ,"" occurred in the course of the first evening they spent together : and though his voice did not falter , and though she had no reason to suppose his eye wandering towards her while he spoke , Anne felt the utter impossibility , from her knowledge of his mind , that he could be unvisited by remembrance any more than herself ."
austen#There must be the same immediate association of thought , though she was very far from conceiving it to be of equal pain . They had no conversation together , no intercourse but what the commonest civility required . Once so much to each other ! Now nothing ! There had been a time , when of all the large party now filling the drawing - room at Uppercross , they would have found it most difficult to cease to speak to one another . With the exception , perhaps , of Admiral and Mrs Croft , who seemed particularly attached and happy , ( Anne could allow no other exceptions even among the married couples ), there could have been no two hearts so open , no tastes so similar , no feelings so in unison , no countenances so beloved .
austen#"Now they were as strangers ; nay , worse than strangers , for they could never become acquainted . It was a perpetual estrangement . When he talked , she heard the same voice , and discerned the same mind . There was a very general ignorance of all naval matters throughout the party ; and he was very much questioned , and especially by the two Miss Musgroves , who seemed hardly to have any eyes but for him , as to the manner of living on board , daily regulations , food , hours , & c ., and their surprise at his accounts , at learning the degree of accommodation and arrangement which was practicable , drew from him some pleasant ridicule , which reminded Anne of the early days when she too had been ignorant , and she too had been accused of supposing sailors to be living on board without anything to eat , or any cook to dress it if there were , or any servant to wait , or any knife and fork to use . From thus listening and thinking , she was roused by a whisper of Mrs Musgrove ' s who , overcome by fond regrets , could not help saying -- "" Ah !"
austen#"Miss Anne , if it had pleased Heaven to spare my poor son , I dare say he would have been just such another by this time ."" Anne suppressed a smile , and listened kindly , while Mrs Musgrove relieved her heart a little more ; and for a few minutes , therefore , could not keep pace with the conversation of the others . When she could let her attention take its natural course again , she found the Miss Musgroves just fetching the Navy List ( their own navy list , the first that had ever been at Uppercross ), and sitting down together to pore over it , with the professed view of finding out the ships that Captain Wentworth had commanded . "" Your first was the Asp , I remember ; we will look for the Asp ."" "" You will not find her there . Quite worn out and broken up ."
austen#"I was the last man who commanded her . Hardly fit for service then . Reported fit for home service for a year or two , and so I was sent off to the West Indies ."" The girls looked all amazement . "" The Admiralty ,"" he continued , "" entertain themselves now and then , with sending a few hundred men to sea , in a ship not fit to be employed . But they have a great many to provide for ; and among the thousands that may just as well go to the bottom as not , it is impossible for them to distinguish the very set who may be least missed ."""
austen#""" Phoo ! phoo !"" cried the Admiral , "" what stuff these young fellows talk ! Never was a better sloop than the Asp in her day . For an old built sloop , you would not see her equal . Lucky fellow to get her !"
austen#"He knows there must have been twenty better men than himself applying for her at the same time . Lucky fellow to get anything so soon , with no more interest than his ."" "" I felt my luck , Admiral , I assure you ;"" replied Captain Wentworth , seriously . "" I was as well satisfied with my appointment as you can desire . It was a great object with me at that time to be at sea ; a very great object , I wanted to be doing something ."" "" To be sure you did ."
austen#"What should a young fellow like you do ashore for half a year together ? If a man had not a wife , he soon wants to be afloat again ."" "" But , Captain Wentworth ,"" cried Louisa , "" how vexed you must have been when you came to the Asp , to see what an old thing they had given you ."" "" I knew pretty well what she was before that day ;"" said he , smiling . "" I had no more discoveries to make than you would have as to the fashion and strength of any old pelisse , which you had seen lent about among half your acquaintance ever since you could remember , and which at last , on some very wet day , is lent to yourself . Ah !"
austen#she was a dear old Asp to me . She did all that I wanted . I knew she would . I knew that we should either go to the bottom together , or that she would be the making of me ; and I never had two days of foul weather all the time I was at sea in her ; and after taking privateers enough to be very entertaining , I had the good luck in my passage home the next autumn , to fall in with the very French frigate I wanted . I brought her into Plymouth ; and here another instance of luck . We had not been six hours in the Sound , when a gale came on , which lasted four days and nights , and which would have done for poor old Asp in half the time ; our touch with the Great Nation not having much improved our condition .
austen#"Four - and - twenty hours later , and I should only have been a gallant Captain Wentworth , in a small paragraph at one corner of the newspapers ; and being lost in only a sloop , nobody would have thought about me ."" Anne ' s shudderings were to herself alone ; but the Miss Musgroves could be as open as they were sincere , in their exclamations of pity and horror . "" And so then , I suppose ,"" said Mrs Musgrove , in a low voice , as if thinking aloud , "" so then he went away to the Laconia , and there he met with our poor boy . Charles , my dear ,"" ( beckoning him to her ), "" do ask Captain Wentworth where it was he first met with your poor brother . I always forgot ."" "" It was at Gibraltar , mother , I know ."
austen#"Dick had been left ill at Gibraltar , with a recommendation from his former captain to Captain Wentworth ."" "" Oh ! but , Charles , tell Captain Wentworth , he need not be afraid of mentioning poor Dick before me , for it would be rather a pleasure to hear him talked of by such a good friend ."" Charles , being somewhat more mindful of the probabilities of the case , only nodded in reply , and walked away . The girls were now hunting for the Laconia ; and Captain Wentworth could not deny himself the pleasure of taking the precious volume into his own hands to save them the trouble , and once more read aloud the little statement of her name and rate , and present non - commissioned class , observing over it that she too had been one of the best friends man ever had . "" Ah !"
austen#those were pleasant days when I had the Laconia ! How fast I made money in her . A friend of mine and I had such a lovely cruise together off the Western Islands . Poor Harville , sister ! You know how much he wanted money : worse than myself . He had a wife .
austen#"Excellent fellow . I shall never forget his happiness . He felt it all , so much for her sake . I wished for him again the next summer , when I had still the same luck in the Mediterranean ."" "" And I am sure , Sir ."" said Mrs Musgrove , "" it was a lucky day for us , when you were put captain into that ship ."
austen#"We shall never forget what you did ."" Her feelings made her speak low ; and Captain Wentworth , hearing only in part , and probably not having Dick Musgrove at all near his thoughts , looked rather in suspense , and as if waiting for more . "" My brother ,"" whispered one of the girls ; "" mamma is thinking of poor Richard ."" "" Poor dear fellow !"" continued Mrs Musgrove ; "" he was grown so steady , and such an excellent correspondent , while he was under your care ! Ah !"
austen#"it would have been a happy thing , if he had never left you . I assure you , Captain Wentworth , we are very sorry he ever left you ."" There was a momentary expression in Captain Wentworth ' s face at this speech , a certain glance of his bright eye , and curl of his handsome mouth , which convinced Anne , that instead of sharing in Mrs Musgrove ' s kind wishes , as to her son , he had probably been at some pains to get rid of him ; but it was too transient an indulgence of self - amusement to be detected by any who understood him less than herself ; in another moment he was perfectly collected and serious , and almost instantly afterwards coming up to the sofa , on which she and Mrs Musgrove were sitting , took a place by the latter , and entered into conversation with her , in a low voice , about her son , doing it with so much sympathy and natural grace , as shewed the kindest consideration for all that was real and unabsurd in the parent ' s feelings . They were actually on the same sofa , for Mrs Musgrove had most readily made room for him ; they were divided only by Mrs Musgrove . It was no insignificant barrier , indeed . Mrs Musgrove was of a comfortable , substantial size , infinitely more fitted by nature to express good cheer and good humour , than tenderness and sentiment ; and while the agitations of Anne ' s slender form , and pensive face , may be considered as very completely screened , Captain Wentworth should be allowed some credit for the self - command with which he attended to her large fat sighings over the destiny of a son , whom alive nobody had cared for ."
austen#"Personal size and mental sorrow have certainly no necessary proportions . A large bulky figure has as good a right to be in deep affliction , as the most graceful set of limbs in the world . But , fair or not fair , there are unbecoming conjunctions , which reason will patronize in vain -- which taste cannot tolerate -- which ridicule will seize . The Admiral , after taking two or three refreshing turns about the room with his hands behind him , being called to order by his wife , now came up to Captain Wentworth , and without any observation of what he might be interrupting , thinking only of his own thoughts , began with -- "" If you had been a week later at Lisbon , last spring , Frederick , you would have been asked to give a passage to Lady Mary Grierson and her daughters ."" "" Should I ?"
austen#"I am glad I was not a week later then ."" The Admiral abused him for his want of gallantry . He defended himself ; though professing that he would never willingly admit any ladies on board a ship of his , excepting for a ball , or a visit , which a few hours might comprehend . "" But , if I know myself ,"" said he , "" this is from no want of gallantry towards them . It is rather from feeling how impossible it is , with all one ' s efforts , and all one ' s sacrifices , to make the accommodations on board such as women ought to have . There can be no want of gallantry , Admiral , in rating the claims of women to every personal comfort high , and this is what I do ."
austen#"I hate to hear of women on board , or to see them on board ; and no ship under my command shall ever convey a family of ladies anywhere , if I can help it ."" This brought his sister upon him . "" Oh ! Frederick ! But I cannot believe it of you . -- All idle refinement !"
austen#"-- Women may be as comfortable on board , as in the best house in England . I believe I have lived as much on board as most women , and I know nothing superior to the accommodations of a man - of - war . I declare I have not a comfort or an indulgence about me , even at Kellynch Hall ,"" ( with a kind bow to Anne ), "" beyond what I always had in most of the ships I have lived in ; and they have been five altogether ."" "" Nothing to the purpose ,"" replied her brother . "" You were living with your husband , and were the only woman on board ."" "" But you , yourself , brought Mrs Harville , her sister , her cousin , and three children , round from Portsmouth to Plymouth ."
austen#"Where was this superfine , extraordinary sort of gallantry of yours then ?"" "" All merged in my friendship , Sophia . I would assist any brother officer ' s wife that I could , and I would bring anything of Harville ' s from the world ' s end , if he wanted it . But do not imagine that I did not feel it an evil in itself ."" "" Depend upon it , they were all perfectly comfortable ."" "" I might not like them the better for that perhaps ."
austen#"Such a number of women and children have no right to be comfortable on board ."" "" My dear Frederick , you are talking quite idly . Pray , what would become of us poor sailors ' wives , who often want to be conveyed to one port or another , after our husbands , if everybody had your feelings ?"" "" My feelings , you see , did not prevent my taking Mrs Harville and all her family to Plymouth ."" "" But I hate to hear you talking so like a fine gentleman , and as if women were all fine ladies , instead of rational creatures . We none of us expect to be in smooth water all our days ."""
austen#""" Ah ! my dear ,"" said the Admiral , "" when he had got a wife , he will sing a different tune . When he is married , if we have the good luck to live to another war , we shall see him do as you and I , and a great many others , have done . We shall have him very thankful to anybody that will bring him his wife ."" "" Ay , that we shall ."" "" Now I have done ,"" cried Captain Wentworth ."
austen#""" When once married people begin to attack me with ,--` Oh ! you will think very differently , when you are married .' I can only say , ` No , I shall not ;' and then they say again , ` Yes , you will ,' and there is an end of it ."" He got up and moved away . "" What a great traveller you must have been , ma ' am !"" said Mrs Musgrove to Mrs Croft ."
austen#""" Pretty well , ma ' am in the fifteen years of my marriage ; though many women have done more . I have crossed the Atlantic four times , and have been once to the East Indies , and back again , and only once ; besides being in different places about home : Cork , and Lisbon , and Gibraltar . But I never went beyond the Streights , and never was in the West Indies . We do not call Bermuda or Bahama , you know , the West Indies ."" Mrs Musgrove had not a word to say in dissent ; she could not accuse herself of having ever called them anything in the whole course of her life . "" And I do assure you , ma ' am ,"" pursued Mrs Croft , "" that nothing can exceed the accommodations of a man - of - war ; I speak , you know , of the higher rates ."
austen#When you come to a frigate , of course , you are more confined ; though any reasonable woman may be perfectly happy in one of them ; and I can safely say , that the happiest part of my life has been spent on board a ship . While we were together , you know , there was nothing to be feared . Thank God ! I have always been blessed with excellent health , and no climate disagrees with me . A little disordered always the first twenty - four hours of going to sea , but never knew what sickness was afterwards . The only time I ever really suffered in body or mind , the only time that I ever fancied myself unwell , or had any ideas of danger , was the winter that I passed by myself at Deal , when the Admiral ( Captain Croft then ) was in the North Seas .
austen#"I lived in perpetual fright at that time , and had all manner of imaginary complaints from not knowing what to do with myself , or when I should hear from him next ; but as long as we could be together , nothing ever ailed me , and I never met with the smallest inconvenience ."" "" Aye , to be sure . Yes , indeed , oh yes ! I am quite of your opinion , Mrs Croft ,"" was Mrs Musgrove ' s hearty answer . "" There is nothing so bad as a separation . I am quite of your opinion ."
austen#"I know what it is , for Mr Musgrove always attends the assizes , and I am so glad when they are over , and he is safe back again ."" The evening ended with dancing . On its being proposed , Anne offered her services , as usual ; and though her eyes would sometimes fill with tears as she sat at the instrument , she was extremely glad to be employed , and desired nothing in return but to be unobserved . It was a merry , joyous party , and no one seemed in higher spirits than Captain Wentworth . She felt that he had every thing to elevate him which general attention and deference , and especially the attention of all the young women , could do . The Miss Hayters , the females of the family of cousins already mentioned , were apparently admitted to the honour of being in love with him ; and as for Henrietta and Louisa , they both seemed so entirely occupied by him , that nothing but the continued appearance of the most perfect good - will between themselves could have made it credible that they were not decided rivals ."
austen#"If he were a little spoilt by such universal , such eager admiration , who could wonder ? These were some of the thoughts which occupied Anne , while her fingers were mechanically at work , proceeding for half an hour together , equally without error , and without consciousness . Once she felt that he was looking at herself , observing her altered features , perhaps , trying to trace in them the ruins of the face which had once charmed him ; and once she knew that he must have spoken of her ; she was hardly aware of it , till she heard the answer ; but then she was sure of his having asked his partner whether Miss Elliot never danced ? The answer was , "" Oh , no ; never ; she has quite given up dancing . She had rather play . She is never tired of playing ."""
austen#"Once , too , he spoke to her . She had left the instrument on the dancing being over , and he had sat down to try to make out an air which he wished to give the Miss Musgroves an idea of . Unintentionally she returned to that part of the room ; he saw her , and , instantly rising , said , with studied politeness -- "" I beg your pardon , madam , this is your seat ;"" and though she immediately drew back with a decided negative , he was not to be induced to sit down again . Anne did not wish for more of such looks and speeches . His cold politeness , his ceremonious grace , were worse than anything ."
austen#Chapter 9 Captain Wentworth was come to Kellynch as to a home , to stay as long as he liked , being as thoroughly the object of the Admiral ' s fraternal kindness as of his wife ' s . He had intended , on first arriving , to proceed very soon into Shropshire , and visit the brother settled in that country , but the attractions of Uppercross induced him to put this off . There was so much of friendliness , and of flattery , and of everything most bewitching in his reception there ; the old were so hospitable , the young so agreeable , that he could not but resolve to remain where he was , and take all the charms and perfections of Edward ' s wife upon credit a little longer . It was soon Uppercross with him almost every day . The Musgroves could hardly be more ready to invite than he to come , particularly in the morning , when he had no companion at home , for the Admiral and Mrs Croft were generally out of doors together , interesting themselves in their new possessions , their grass , and their sheep , and dawdling about in a way not endurable to a third person , or driving out in a gig , lately added to their establishment .
austen#Hitherto there had been but one opinion of Captain Wentworth among the Musgroves and their dependencies . It was unvarying , warm admiration everywhere ; but this intimate footing was not more than established , when a certain Charles Hayter returned among them , to be a good deal disturbed by it , and to think Captain Wentworth very much in the way . Charles Hayter was the eldest of all the cousins , and a very amiable , pleasing young man , between whom and Henrietta there had been a considerable appearance of attachment previous to Captain Wentworth ' s introduction . He was in orders ; and having a curacy in the neighbourhood , where residence was not required , lived at his father ' s house , only two miles from Uppercross . A short absence from home had left his fair one unguarded by his attentions at this critical period , and when he came back he had the pain of finding very altered manners , and of seeing Captain Wentworth . Mrs Musgrove and Mrs Hayter were sisters .
austen#"They had each had money , but their marriages had made a material difference in their degree of consequence . Mr Hayter had some property of his own , but it was insignificant compared with Mr Musgrove ' s ; and while the Musgroves were in the first class of society in the country , the young Hayters would , from their parents ' inferior , retired , and unpolished way of living , and their own defective education , have been hardly in any class at all , but for their connexion with Uppercross , this eldest son of course excepted , who had chosen to be a scholar and a gentleman , and who was very superior in cultivation and manners to all the rest . The two families had always been on excellent terms , there being no pride on one side , and no envy on the other , and only such a consciousness of superiority in the Miss Musgroves , as made them pleased to improve their cousins . Charles ' s attentions to Henrietta had been observed by her father and mother without any disapprobation . "" It would not be a great match for her ; but if Henrietta liked him ,""-- and Henrietta did seem to like him . Henrietta fully thought so herself , before Captain Wentworth came ; but from that time Cousin Charles had been very much forgotten ."
austen#"Which of the two sisters was preferred by Captain Wentworth was as yet quite doubtful , as far as Anne ' s observation reached . Henrietta was perhaps the prettiest , Louisa had the higher spirits ; and she knew not now , whether the more gentle or the more lively character were most likely to attract him . Mr and Mrs Musgrove , either from seeing little , or from an entire confidence in the discretion of both their daughters , and of all the young men who came near them , seemed to leave everything to take its chance . There was not the smallest appearance of solicitude or remark about them in the Mansion - house ; but it was different at the Cottage : the young couple there were more disposed to speculate and wonder ; and Captain Wentworth had not been above four or five times in the Miss Musgroves ' company , and Charles Hayter had but just reappeared , when Anne had to listen to the opinions of her brother and sister , as to which was the one liked best . Charles gave it for Louisa , Mary for Henrietta , but quite agreeing that to have him marry either could be extremely delightful . Charles "" had never seen a pleasanter man in his life ; and from what he had once heard Captain Wentworth himself say , was very sure that he had not made less than twenty thousand pounds by the war ."
austen#"Here was a fortune at once ; besides which , there would be the chance of what might be done in any future war ; and he was sure Captain Wentworth was as likely a man to distinguish himself as any officer in the navy . Oh ! it would be a capital match for either of his sisters ."" "" Upon my word it would ,"" replied Mary . "" Dear me ! If he should rise to any very great honours !"
austen#"If he should ever be made a baronet ! ` Lady Wentworth ' sounds very well . That would be a noble thing , indeed , for Henrietta ! She would take place of me then , and Henrietta would not dislike that . Sir Frederick and Lady Wentworth ! It would be but a new creation , however , and I never think much of your new creations ."""
austen#"It suited Mary best to think Henrietta the one preferred on the very account of Charles Hayter , whose pretensions she wished to see put an end to . She looked down very decidedly upon the Hayters , and thought it would be quite a misfortune to have the existing connection between the families renewed -- very sad for herself and her children . "" You know ,"" said she , "" I cannot think him at all a fit match for Henrietta ; and considering the alliances which the Musgroves have made , she has no right to throw herself away . I do not think any young woman has a right to make a choice that may be disagreeable and inconvenient to the principal part of her family , and be giving bad connections to those who have not been used to them . And , pray , who is Charles Hayter ? Nothing but a country curate ."
austen#"A most improper match for Miss Musgrove of Uppercross ."" Her husband , however , would not agree with her here ; for besides having a regard for his cousin , Charles Hayter was an eldest son , and he saw things as an eldest son himself . "" Now you are taking nonsense , Mary ,"" was therefore his answer . "" It would not be a great match for Henrietta , but Charles has a very fair chance , through the Spicers , of getting something from the Bishop in the course of a year or two ; and you will please to remember , that he is the eldest son ; whenever my uncle dies , he steps into very pretty property . The estate at Winthrop is not less than two hundred and fifty acres , besides the farm near Taunton , which is some of the best land in the country . I grant you , that any of them but Charles would be a very shocking match for Henrietta , and indeed it could not be ; he is the only one that could be possible ; but he is a very good - natured , good sort of a fellow ; and whenever Winthrop comes into his hands , he will make a different sort of place of it , and live in a very different sort of way ; and with that property , he will never be a contemptible man -- good , freehold property ."
austen#"No , no ; Henrietta might do worse than marry Charles Hayter ; and if she has him , and Louisa can get Captain Wentworth , I shall be very well satisfied ."" "" Charles may say what he pleases ,"" cried Mary to Anne , as soon as he was out of the room , "" but it would be shocking to have Henrietta marry Charles Hayter ; a very bad thing for her , and still worse for me ; and therefore it is very much to be wished that Captain Wentworth may soon put him quite out of her head , and I have very little doubt that he has . She took hardly any notice of Charles Hayter yesterday . I wish you had been there to see her behaviour . And as to Captain Wentworth ' s liking Louisa as well as Henrietta , it is nonsense to say so ; for he certainly does like Henrietta a great deal the best . But Charles is so positive !"
austen#"I wish you had been with us yesterday , for then you might have decided between us ; and I am sure you would have thought as I did , unless you had been determined to give it against me ."" A dinner at Mr Musgrove ' s had been the occasion when all these things should have been seen by Anne ; but she had staid at home , under the mixed plea of a headache of her own , and some return of indisposition in little Charles . She had thought only of avoiding Captain Wentworth ; but an escape from being appealed to as umpire was now added to the advantages of a quiet evening . As to Captain Wentworth ' s views , she deemed it of more consequence that he should know his own mind early enough not to be endangering the happiness of either sister , or impeaching his own honour , than that he should prefer Henrietta to Louisa , or Louisa to Henrietta . Either of them would , in all probability , make him an affectionate , good - humoured wife . With regard to Charles Hayter , she had delicacy which must be pained by any lightness of conduct in a well - meaning young woman , and a heart to sympathize in any of the sufferings it occasioned ; but if Henrietta found herself mistaken in the nature of her feelings , the alternation could not be understood too soon ."
austen#Charles Hayter had met with much to disquiet and mortify him in his cousin ' s behaviour . She had too old a regard for him to be so wholly estranged as might in two meetings extinguish every past hope , and leave him nothing to do but to keep away from Uppercross : but there was such a change as became very alarming , when such a man as Captain Wentworth was to be regarded as the probable cause . He had been absent only two Sundays , and when they parted , had left her interested , even to the height of his wishes , in his prospect of soon quitting his present curacy , and obtaining that of Uppercross instead . It had then seemed the object nearest her heart , that Dr Shirley , the rector , who for more than forty years had been zealously discharging all the duties of his office , but was now growing too infirm for many of them , should be quite fixed on engaging a curate ; should make his curacy quite as good as he could afford , and should give Charles Hayter the promise of it . The advantage of his having to come only to Uppercross , instead of going six miles another way ; of his having , in every respect , a better curacy ; of his belonging to their dear Dr Shirley , and of dear , good Dr Shirley ' s being relieved from the duty which he could no longer get through without most injurious fatigue , had been a great deal , even to Louisa , but had been almost everything to Henrietta . When he came back , alas !
austen#"the zeal of the business was gone by . Louisa could not listen at all to his account of a conversation which he had just held with Dr Shirley : she was at a window , looking out for Captain Wentworth ; and even Henrietta had at best only a divided attention to give , and seemed to have forgotten all the former doubt and solicitude of the negotiation . "" Well , I am very glad indeed : but I always thought you would have it ; I always thought you sure . It did not appear to me that -- in short , you know , Dr Shirley must have a curate , and you had secured his promise . Is he coming , Louisa ?"" One morning , very soon after the dinner at the Musgroves , at which Anne had not been present , Captain Wentworth walked into the drawing - room at the Cottage , where were only herself and the little invalid Charles , who was lying on the sofa ."
austen#"The surprise of finding himself almost alone with Anne Elliot , deprived his manners of their usual composure : he started , and could only say , "" I thought the Miss Musgroves had been here : Mrs Musgrove told me I should find them here ,"" before he walked to the window to recollect himself , and feel how he ought to behave . "" They are up stairs with my sister : they will be down in a few moments , I dare say ,"" had been Anne ' s reply , in all the confusion that was natural ; and if the child had not called her to come and do something for him , she would have been out of the room the next moment , and released Captain Wentworth as well as herself . He continued at the window ; and after calmly and politely saying , "" I hope the little boy is better ,"" was silent . She was obliged to kneel down by the sofa , and remain there to satisfy her patient ; and thus they continued a few minutes , when , to her very great satisfaction , she heard some other person crossing the little vestibule . She hoped , on turning her head , to see the master of the house ; but it proved to be one much less calculated for making matters easy -- Charles Hayter , probably not at all better pleased by the sight of Captain Wentworth than Captain Wentworth had been by the sight of Anne . She only attempted to say , "" How do you do ?"
austen#"Will you not sit down ? The others will be here presently ."" Captain Wentworth , however , came from his window , apparently not ill - disposed for conversation ; but Charles Hayter soon put an end to his attempts by seating himself near the table , and taking up the newspaper ; and Captain Wentworth returned to his window . Another minute brought another addition . The younger boy , a remarkable stout , forward child , of two years old , having got the door opened for him by some one without , made his determined appearance among them , and went straight to the sofa to see what was going on , and put in his claim to anything good that might be giving away . There being nothing to eat , he could only have some play ; and as his aunt would not let him tease his sick brother , he began to fasten himself upon her , as she knelt , in such a way that , busy as she was about Charles , she could not shake him off ."
austen#"She spoke to him , ordered , entreated , and insisted in vain . Once she did contrive to push him away , but the boy had the greater pleasure in getting upon her back again directly . "" Walter ,"" said she , "" get down this moment . You are extremely troublesome . I am very angry with you ."" "" Walter ,"" cried Charles Hayter , "" why do you not do as you are bid ?"
austen#"Do not you hear your aunt speak ? Come to me , Walter , come to cousin Charles ."" But not a bit did Walter stir . In another moment , however , she found herself in the state of being released from him ; some one was taking him from her , though he had bent down her head so much , that his little sturdy hands were unfastened from around her neck , and he was resolutely borne away , before she knew that Captain Wentworth had done it . Her sensations on the discovery made her perfectly speechless . She could not even thank him ."
austen#"She could only hang over little Charles , with most disordered feelings . His kindness in stepping forward to her relief , the manner , the silence in which it had passed , the little particulars of the circumstance , with the conviction soon forced on her by the noise he was studiously making with the child , that he meant to avoid hearing her thanks , and rather sought to testify that her conversation was the last of his wants , produced such a confusion of varying , but very painful agitation , as she could not recover from , till enabled by the entrance of Mary and the Miss Musgroves to make over her little patient to their cares , and leave the room . She could not stay . It might have been an opportunity of watching the loves and jealousies of the four -- they were now altogether ; but she could stay for none of it . It was evident that Charles Hayter was not well inclined towards Captain Wentworth . She had a strong impression of his having said , in a vext tone of voice , after Captain Wentworth ' s interference , "" You ought to have minded me , Walter ; I told you not to teaze your aunt ;"" and could comprehend his regretting that Captain Wentworth should do what he ought to have done himself ."
austen#But neither Charles Hayter ' s feelings , nor anybody ' s feelings , could interest her , till she had a little better arranged her own . She was ashamed of herself , quite ashamed of being so nervous , so overcome by such a trifle ; but so it was , and it required a long application of solitude and reflection to recover her . Chapter 10 Other opportunities of making her observations could not fail to occur . Anne had soon been in company with all the four together often enough to have an opinion , though too wise to acknowledge as much at home , where she knew it would have satisfied neither husband nor wife ; for while she considered Louisa to be rather the favourite , she could not but think , as far as she might dare to judge from memory and experience , that Captain Wentworth was not in love with either . They were more in love with him ; yet there it was not love .
austen#It was a little fever of admiration ; but it might , probably must , end in love with some . Charles Hayter seemed aware of being slighted , and yet Henrietta had sometimes the air of being divided between them . Anne longed for the power of representing to them all what they were about , and of pointing out some of the evils they were exposing themselves to . She did not attribute guile to any . It was the highest satisfaction to her to believe Captain Wentworth not in the least aware of the pain he was occasioning . There was no triumph , no pitiful triumph in his manner .
austen#He had , probably , never heard , and never thought of any claims of Charles Hayter . He was only wrong in accepting the attentions ( for accepting must be the word ) of two young women at once . After a short struggle , however , Charles Hayter seemed to quit the field . Three days had passed without his coming once to Uppercross ; a most decided change . He had even refused one regular invitation to dinner ; and having been found on the occasion by Mr Musgrove with some large books before him , Mr and Mrs Musgrove were sure all could not be right , and talked , with grave faces , of his studying himself to death . It was Mary ' s hope and belief that he had received a positive dismissal from Henrietta , and her husband lived under the constant dependence of seeing him to - morrow .
austen#"Anne could only feel that Charles Hayter was wise . One morning , about this time Charles Musgrove and Captain Wentworth being gone a - shooting together , as the sisters in the Cottage were sitting quietly at work , they were visited at the window by the sisters from the Mansion - house . It was a very fine November day , and the Miss Musgroves came through the little grounds , and stopped for no other purpose than to say , that they were going to take a long walk , and therefore concluded Mary could not like to go with them ; and when Mary immediately replied , with some jealousy at not being supposed a good walker , "" Oh , yes , I should like to join you very much , I am very fond of a long walk ;"" Anne felt persuaded , by the looks of the two girls , that it was precisely what they did not wish , and admired again the sort of necessity which the family habits seemed to produce , of everything being to be communicated , and everything being to be done together , however undesired and inconvenient . She tried to dissuade Mary from going , but in vain ; and that being the case , thought it best to accept the Miss Musgroves ' much more cordial invitation to herself to go likewise , as she might be useful in turning back with her sister , and lessening the interference in any plan of their own . "" I cannot imagine why they should suppose I should not like a long walk ,"" said Mary , as she went up stairs . "" Everybody is always supposing that I am not a good walker ; and yet they would not have been pleased , if we had refused to join them ."
austen#"When people come in this manner on purpose to ask us , how can one say no ?"" Just as they were setting off , the gentlemen returned . They had taken out a young dog , who had spoilt their sport , and sent them back early . Their time and strength , and spirits , were , therefore , exactly ready for this walk , and they entered into it with pleasure . Could Anne have foreseen such a junction , she would have staid at home ; but , from some feelings of interest and curiosity , she fancied now that it was too late to retract , and the whole six set forward together in the direction chosen by the Miss Musgroves , who evidently considered the walk as under their guidance . Anne ' s object was , not to be in the way of anybody ; and where the narrow paths across the fields made many separations necessary , to keep with her brother and sister ."
austen#Her pleasure in the walk must arise from the exercise and the day , from the view of the last smiles of the year upon the tawny leaves , and withered hedges , and from repeating to herself some few of the thousand poetical descriptions extant of autumn , that season of peculiar and inexhaustible influence on the mind of taste and tenderness , that season which had drawn from every poet , worthy of being read , some attempt at description , or some lines of feeling . She occupied her mind as much as possible in such like musings and quotations ; but it was not possible , that when within reach of Captain Wentworth ' s conversation with either of the Miss Musgroves , she should not try to hear it ; yet she caught little very remarkable . It was mere lively chat , such as any young persons , on an intimate footing , might fall into . He was more engaged with Louisa than with Henrietta . Louisa certainly put more forward for his notice than her sister . This distinction appeared to increase , and there was one speech of Louisa ' s which struck her .
austen#"After one of the many praises of the day , which were continually bursting forth , Captain Wentworth added : -- "" What glorious weather for the Admiral and my sister ! They meant to take a long drive this morning ; perhaps we may hail them from some of these hills . They talked of coming into this side of the country . I wonder whereabouts they will upset to - day . Oh !"
austen#"it does happen very often , I assure you ; but my sister makes nothing of it ; she would as lieve be tossed out as not ."" "" Ah ! You make the most of it , I know ,"" cried Louisa , "" but if it were really so , I should do just the same in her place . If I loved a man , as she loves the Admiral , I would always be with him , nothing should ever separate us , and I would rather be overturned by him , than driven safely by anybody else ."" It was spoken with enthusiasm . "" Had you ?"""
austen#"cried he , catching the same tone ; "" I honour you !"" And there was silence between them for a little while . Anne could not immediately fall into a quotation again . The sweet scenes of autumn were for a while put by , unless some tender sonnet , fraught with the apt analogy of the declining year , with declining happiness , and the images of youth and hope , and spring , all gone together , blessed her memory . She roused herself to say , as they struck by order into another path , "" Is not this one of the ways to Winthrop ?"" But nobody heard , or , at least , nobody answered her ."
austen#"Winthrop , however , or its environs -- for young men are , sometimes to be met with , strolling about near home -- was their destination ; and after another half mile of gradual ascent through large enclosures , where the ploughs at work , and the fresh made path spoke the farmer counteracting the sweets of poetical despondence , and meaning to have spring again , they gained the summit of the most considerable hill , which parted Uppercross and Winthrop , and soon commanded a full view of the latter , at the foot of the hill on the other side . Winthrop , without beauty and without dignity , was stretched before them an indifferent house , standing low , and hemmed in by the barns and buildings of a farm - yard . Mary exclaimed , "" Bless me ! here is Winthrop . I declare I had no idea ! Well now , I think we had better turn back ; I am excessively tired ."""
austen#"Henrietta , conscious and ashamed , and seeing no cousin Charles walking along any path , or leaning against any gate , was ready to do as Mary wished ; but "" No !"" said Charles Musgrove , and "" No , no !"" cried Louisa more eagerly , and taking her sister aside , seemed to be arguing the matter warmly . Charles , in the meanwhile , was very decidedly declaring his resolution of calling on his aunt , now that he was so near ; and very evidently , though more fearfully , trying to induce his wife to go too . But this was one of the points on which the lady shewed her strength ; and when he recommended the advantage of resting herself a quarter of an hour at Winthrop , as she felt so tired , she resolutely answered , "" Oh ! no , indeed !"
austen#"walking up that hill again would do her more harm than any sitting down could do her good ;"" and , in short , her look and manner declared , that go she would not . After a little succession of these sort of debates and consultations , it was settled between Charles and his two sisters , that he and Henrietta should just run down for a few minutes , to see their aunt and cousins , while the rest of the party waited for them at the top of the hill . Louisa seemed the principal arranger of the plan ; and , as she went a little way with them , down the hill , still talking to Henrietta , Mary took the opportunity of looking scornfully around her , and saying to Captain Wentworth -- "" It is very unpleasant , having such connexions ! But , I assure you , I have never been in the house above twice in my life ."" She received no other answer , than an artificial , assenting smile , followed by a contemptuous glance , as he turned away , which Anne perfectly knew the meaning of ."
austen#The brow of the hill , where they remained , was a cheerful spot : Louisa returned ; and Mary , finding a comfortable seat for herself on the step of a stile , was very well satisfied so long as the others all stood about her ; but when Louisa drew Captain Wentworth away , to try for a gleaning of nuts in an adjoining hedge - row , and they were gone by degrees quite out of sight and sound , Mary was happy no longer ; she quarrelled with her own seat , was sure Louisa had got a much better somewhere , and nothing could prevent her from going to look for a better also . She turned through the same gate , but could not see them . Anne found a nice seat for her , on a dry sunny bank , under the hedge - row , in which she had no doubt of their still being , in some spot or other . Mary sat down for a moment , but it would not do ; she was sure Louisa had found a better seat somewhere else , and she would go on till she overtook her . Anne , really tired herself , was glad to sit down ; and she very soon heard Captain Wentworth and Louisa in the hedge - row , behind her , as if making their way back along the rough , wild sort of channel , down the centre . They were speaking as they drew near .
austen#"Louisa ' s voice was the first distinguished . She seemed to be in the middle of some eager speech . What Anne first heard was -- "" And so , I made her go . I could not bear that she should be frightened from the visit by such nonsense . What !"
austen#"would I be turned back from doing a thing that I had determined to do , and that I knew to be right , by the airs and interference of such a person , or of any person I may say ? No , I have no idea of being so easily persuaded . When I have made up my mind , I have made it ; and Henrietta seemed entirely to have made up hers to call at Winthrop to - day ; and yet , she was as near giving it up , out of nonsensical complaisance !"" "" She would have turned back then , but for you ?"" "" She would indeed . I am almost ashamed to say it ."""
austen#""" Happy for her , to have such a mind as yours at hand ! After the hints you gave just now , which did but confirm my own observations , the last time I was in company with him , I need not affect to have no comprehension of what is going on . I see that more than a mere dutiful morning visit to your aunt was in question ; and woe betide him , and her too , when it comes to things of consequence , when they are placed in circumstances requiring fortitude and strength of mind , if she have not resolution enough to resist idle interference in such a trifle as this . Your sister is an amiable creature ; but yours is the character of decision and firmness , I see . If you value her conduct or happiness , infuse as much of your own spirit into her as you can . But this , no doubt , you have been always doing ."
austen#"It is the worst evil of too yielding and indecisive a character , that no influence over it can be depended on . You are never sure of a good impression being durable ; everybody may sway it . Let those who would be happy be firm . Here is a nut ,"" said he , catching one down from an upper bough . "" to exemplify : a beautiful glossy nut , which , blessed with original strength , has outlived all the storms of autumn . Not a puncture , not a weak spot anywhere ."
austen#"This nut ,"" he continued , with playful solemnity , "" while so many of his brethren have fallen and been trodden under foot , is still in possession of all the happiness that a hazel nut can be supposed capable of ."" Then returning to his former earnest tone -- "" My first wish for all whom I am interested in , is that they should be firm . If Louisa Musgrove would be beautiful and happy in her November of life , she will cherish all her present powers of mind ."" He had done , and was unanswered . It would have surprised Anne if Louisa could have readily answered such a speech : words of such interest , spoken with such serious warmth ! She could imagine what Louisa was feeling ."
austen#"For herself , she feared to move , lest she should be seen . While she remained , a bush of low rambling holly protected her , and they were moving on . Before they were beyond her hearing , however , Louisa spoke again . "" Mary is good - natured enough in many respects ,"" said she ; "" but she does sometimes provoke me excessively , by her nonsense and pride -- the Elliot pride . She has a great deal too much of the Elliot pride . We do so wish that Charles had married Anne instead ."
austen#"I suppose you know he wanted to marry Anne ?"" After a moment ' s pause , Captain Wentworth said -- "" Do you mean that she refused him ?"" "" Oh ! yes ; certainly ."" "" When did that happen ?"""
austen#""" I do not exactly know , for Henrietta and I were at school at the time ; but I believe about a year before he married Mary . I wish she had accepted him . We should all have liked her a great deal better ; and papa and mamma always think it was her great friend Lady Russell ' s doing , that she did not . They think Charles might not be learned and bookish enough to please Lady Russell , and that therefore , she persuaded Anne to refuse him ."" The sounds were retreating , and Anne distinguished no more . Her own emotions still kept her fixed ."
austen#She had much to recover from , before she could move . The listener ' s proverbial fate was not absolutely hers ; she had heard no evil of herself , but she had heard a great deal of very painful import . She saw how her own character was considered by Captain Wentworth , and there had been just that degree of feeling and curiosity about her in his manner which must give her extreme agitation . As soon as she could , she went after Mary , and having found , and walked back with her to their former station , by the stile , felt some comfort in their whole party being immediately afterwards collected , and once more in motion together . Her spirits wanted the solitude and silence which only numbers could give . Charles and Henrietta returned , bringing , as may be conjectured , Charles Hayter with them .
austen#The minutiae of the business Anne could not attempt to understand ; even Captain Wentworth did not seem admitted to perfect confidence here ; but that there had been a withdrawing on the gentleman ' s side , and a relenting on the lady ' s , and that they were now very glad to be together again , did not admit a doubt . Henrietta looked a little ashamed , but very well pleased ;-- Charles Hayter exceedingly happy : and they were devoted to each other almost from the first instant of their all setting forward for Uppercross . Everything now marked out Louisa for Captain Wentworth ; nothing could be plainer ; and where many divisions were necessary , or even where they were not , they walked side by side nearly as much as the other two . In a long strip of meadow land , where there was ample space for all , they were thus divided , forming three distinct parties ; and to that party of the three which boasted least animation , and least complaisance , Anne necessarily belonged . She joined Charles and Mary , and was tired enough to be very glad of Charles ' s other arm ; but Charles , though in very good humour with her , was out of temper with his wife . Mary had shewn herself disobliging to him , and was now to reap the consequence , which consequence was his dropping her arm almost every moment to cut off the heads of some nettles in the hedge with his switch ; and when Mary began to complain of it , and lament her being ill - used , according to custom , in being on the hedge side , while Anne was never incommoded on the other , he dropped the arms of both to hunt after a weasel which he had a momentary glance of , and they could hardly get him along at all .
austen#This long meadow bordered a lane , which their footpath , at the end of it was to cross , and when the party had all reached the gate of exit , the carriage advancing in the same direction , which had been some time heard , was just coming up , and proved to be Admiral Croft ' s gig . He and his wife had taken their intended drive , and were returning home . Upon hearing how long a walk the young people had engaged in , they kindly offered a seat to any lady who might be particularly tired ; it would save her a full mile , and they were going through Uppercross . The invitation was general , and generally declined . The Miss Musgroves were not at all tired , and Mary was either offended , by not being asked before any of the others , or what Louisa called the Elliot pride could not endure to make a third in a one horse chaise . The walking party had crossed the lane , and were surmounting an opposite stile , and the Admiral was putting his horse in motion again , when Captain Wentworth cleared the hedge in a moment to say something to his sister .
austen#"The something might be guessed by its effects . "" Miss Elliot , I am sure you are tired ,"" cried Mrs Croft . "" Do let us have the pleasure of taking you home . Here is excellent room for three , I assure you . If we were all like you , I believe we might sit four . You must , indeed , you must ."""
austen#Anne was still in the lane ; and though instinctively beginning to decline , she was not allowed to proceed . The Admiral ' s kind urgency came in support of his wife ' s ; they would not be refused ; they compressed themselves into the smallest possible space to leave her a corner , and Captain Wentworth , without saying a word , turned to her , and quietly obliged her to be assisted into the carriage . Yes ; he had done it . She was in the carriage , and felt that he had placed her there , that his will and his hands had done it , that she owed it to his perception of her fatigue , and his resolution to give her rest . She was very much affected by the view of his disposition towards her , which all these things made apparent . This little circumstance seemed the completion of all that had gone before .
austen#She understood him . He could not forgive her , but he could not be unfeeling . Though condemning her for the past , and considering it with high and unjust resentment , though perfectly careless of her , and though becoming attached to another , still he could not see her suffer , without the desire of giving her relief . It was a remainder of former sentiment ; it was an impulse of pure , though unacknowledged friendship ; it was a proof of his own warm and amiable heart , which she could not contemplate without emotions so compounded of pleasure and pain , that she knew not which prevailed . Her answers to the kindness and the remarks of her companions were at first unconsciously given . They had travelled half their way along the rough lane , before she was quite awake to what they said .
austen#"She then found them talking of "" Frederick ."" "" He certainly means to have one or other of those two girls , Sophy ,"" said the Admiral ; "" but there is no saying which . He has been running after them , too , long enough , one would think , to make up his mind . Ay , this comes of the peace . If it were war now , he would have settled it long ago . We sailors , Miss Elliot , cannot afford to make long courtships in time of war ."
austen#"How many days was it , my dear , between the first time of my seeing you and our sitting down together in our lodgings at North Yarmouth ?"" "" We had better not talk about it , my dear ,"" replied Mrs Croft , pleasantly ; "" for if Miss Elliot were to hear how soon we came to an understanding , she would never be persuaded that we could be happy together . I had known you by character , however , long before ."" "" Well , and I had heard of you as a very pretty girl , and what were we to wait for besides ? I do not like having such things so long in hand . I wish Frederick would spread a little more canvass , and bring us home one of these young ladies to Kellynch ."
austen#"Then there would always be company for them . And very nice young ladies they both are ; I hardly know one from the other ."" "" Very good humoured , unaffected girls , indeed ,"" said Mrs Croft , in a tone of calmer praise , such as made Anne suspect that her keener powers might not consider either of them as quite worthy of her brother ; "" and a very respectable family . One could not be connected with better people . My dear Admiral , that post ! we shall certainly take that post ."""
austen#But by coolly giving the reins a better direction herself they happily passed the danger ; and by once afterwards judiciously putting out her hand they neither fell into a rut , nor ran foul of a dung - cart ; and Anne , with some amusement at their style of driving , which she imagined no bad representation of the general guidance of their affairs , found herself safely deposited by them at the Cottage . Chapter 11 The time now approached for Lady Russell ' s return : the day was even fixed ; and Anne , being engaged to join her as soon as she was resettled , was looking forward to an early removal to Kellynch , and beginning to think how her own comfort was likely to be affected by it . It would place her in the same village with Captain Wentworth , within half a mile of him ; they would have to frequent the same church , and there must be intercourse between the two families . This was against her ; but on the other hand , he spent so much of his time at Uppercross , that in removing thence she might be considered rather as leaving him behind , than as going towards him ; and , upon the whole , she believed she must , on this interesting question , be the gainer , almost as certainly as in her change of domestic society , in leaving poor Mary for Lady Russell . She wished it might be possible for her to avoid ever seeing Captain Wentworth at the Hall : those rooms had witnessed former meetings which would be brought too painfully before her ; but she was yet more anxious for the possibility of Lady Russell and Captain Wentworth never meeting anywhere .
austen#They did not like each other , and no renewal of acquaintance now could do any good ; and were Lady Russell to see them together , she might think that he had too much self - possession , and she too little . These points formed her chief solicitude in anticipating her removal from Uppercross , where she felt she had been stationed quite long enough . Her usefulness to little Charles would always give some sweetness to the memory of her two months ' visit there , but he was gaining strength apace , and she had nothing else to stay for . The conclusion of her visit , however , was diversified in a way which she had not at all imagined . Captain Wentworth , after being unseen and unheard of at Uppercross for two whole days , appeared again among them to justify himself by a relation of what had kept him away . A letter from his friend , Captain Harville , having found him out at last , had brought intelligence of Captain Harville ' s being settled with his family at Lyme for the winter ; of their being therefore , quite unknowingly , within twenty miles of each other .
austen#Captain Harville had never been in good health since a severe wound which he received two years before , and Captain Wentworth ' s anxiety to see him had determined him to go immediately to Lyme . He had been there for four - and - twenty hours . His acquittal was complete , his friendship warmly honoured , a lively interest excited for his friend , and his description of the fine country about Lyme so feelingly attended to by the party , that an earnest desire to see Lyme themselves , and a project for going thither was the consequence . The young people were all wild to see Lyme . Captain Wentworth talked of going there again himself , it was only seventeen miles from Uppercross ; though November , the weather was by no means bad ; and , in short , Louisa , who was the most eager of the eager , having formed the resolution to go , and besides the pleasure of doing as she liked , being now armed with the idea of merit in maintaining her own way , bore down all the wishes of her father and mother for putting it off till summer ; and to Lyme they were to go -- Charles , Mary , Anne , Henrietta , Louisa , and Captain Wentworth . The first heedless scheme had been to go in the morning and return at night ; but to this Mr Musgrove , for the sake of his horses , would not consent ; and when it came to be rationally considered , a day in the middle of November would not leave much time for seeing a new place , after deducting seven hours , as the nature of the country required , for going and returning .
austen#They were , consequently , to stay the night there , and not to be expected back till the next day ' s dinner . This was felt to be a considerable amendment ; and though they all met at the Great House at rather an early breakfast hour , and set off very punctually , it was so much past noon before the two carriages , Mr Musgrove ' s coach containing the four ladies , and Charles ' s curricle , in which he drove Captain Wentworth , were descending the long hill into Lyme , and entering upon the still steeper street of the town itself , that it was very evident they would not have more than time for looking about them , before the light and warmth of the day were gone . After securing accommodations , and ordering a dinner at one of the inns , the next thing to be done was unquestionably to walk directly down to the sea . They were come too late in the year for any amusement or variety which Lyme , as a public place , might offer . The rooms were shut up , the lodgers almost all gone , scarcely any family but of the residents left ; and , as there is nothing to admire in the buildings themselves , the remarkable situation of the town , the principal street almost hurrying into the water , the walk to the Cobb , skirting round the pleasant little bay , which , in the season , is animated with bathing machines and company ; the Cobb itself , its old wonders and new improvements , with the very beautiful line of cliffs stretching out to the east of the town , are what the stranger ' s eye will seek ; and a very strange stranger it must be , who does not see charms in the immediate environs of Lyme , to make him wish to know it better . The scenes in its neighbourhood , Charmouth , with its high grounds and extensive sweeps of country , and still more , its sweet , retired bay , backed by dark cliffs , where fragments of low rock among the sands , make it the happiest spot for watching the flow of the tide , for sitting in unwearied contemplation ; the woody varieties of the cheerful village of Up Lyme ; and , above all , Pinny , with its green chasms between romantic rocks , where the scattered forest trees and orchards of luxuriant growth , declare that many a generation must have passed away since the first partial falling of the cliff prepared the ground for such a state , where a scene so wonderful and so lovely is exhibited , as may more than equal any of the resembling scenes of the far - famed Isle of Wight : these places must be visited , and visited again , to make the worth of Lyme understood .
austen#The party from Uppercross passing down by the now deserted and melancholy looking rooms , and still descending , soon found themselves on the sea - shore ; and lingering only , as all must linger and gaze on a first return to the sea , who ever deserved to look on it at all , proceeded towards the Cobb , equally their object in itself and on Captain Wentworth ' s account : for in a small house , near the foot of an old pier of unknown date , were the Harvilles settled . Captain Wentworth turned in to call on his friend ; the others walked on , and he was to join them on the Cobb . They were by no means tired of wondering and admiring ; and not even Louisa seemed to feel that they had parted with Captain Wentworth long , when they saw him coming after them , with three companions , all well known already , by description , to be Captain and Mrs Harville , and a Captain Benwick , who was staying with them . Captain Benwick had some time ago been first lieutenant of the Laconia ; and the account which Captain Wentworth had given of him , on his return from Lyme before , his warm praise of him as an excellent young man and an officer , whom he had always valued highly , which must have stamped him well in the esteem of every listener , had been followed by a little history of his private life , which rendered him perfectly interesting in the eyes of all the ladies . He had been engaged to Captain Harville ' s sister , and was now mourning her loss . They had been a year or two waiting for fortune and promotion .
austen#Fortune came , his prize - money as lieutenant being great ; promotion , too , came at last ; but Fanny Harville did not live to know it . She had died the preceding summer while he was at sea . Captain Wentworth believed it impossible for man to be more attached to woman than poor Benwick had been to Fanny Harville , or to be more deeply afflicted under the dreadful change . He considered his disposition as of the sort which must suffer heavily , uniting very strong feelings with quiet , serious , and retiring manners , and a decided taste for reading , and sedentary pursuits . To finish the interest of the story , the friendship between him and the Harvilles seemed , if possible , augmented by the event which closed all their views of alliance , and Captain Benwick was now living with them entirely . Captain Harville had taken his present house for half a year ; his taste , and his health , and his fortune , all directing him to a residence inexpensive , and by the sea ; and the grandeur of the country , and the retirement of Lyme in the winter , appeared exactly adapted to Captain Benwick ' s state of mind .
austen#"The sympathy and good - will excited towards Captain Benwick was very great . "" And yet ,"" said Anne to herself , as they now moved forward to meet the party , "" he has not , perhaps , a more sorrowing heart than I have . I cannot believe his prospects so blighted for ever . He is younger than I am ; younger in feeling , if not in fact ; younger as a man . He will rally again , and be happy with another ."" They all met , and were introduced ."
austen#Captain Harville was a tall , dark man , with a sensible , benevolent countenance ; a little lame ; and from strong features and want of health , looking much older than Captain Wentworth . Captain Benwick looked , and was , the youngest of the three , and , compared with either of them , a little man . He had a pleasing face and a melancholy air , just as he ought to have , and drew back from conversation . Captain Harville , though not equalling Captain Wentworth in manners , was a perfect gentleman , unaffected , warm , and obliging . Mrs Harville , a degree less polished than her husband , seemed , however , to have the same good feelings ; and nothing could be more pleasant than their desire of considering the whole party as friends of their own , because the friends of Captain Wentworth , or more kindly hospitable than their entreaties for their all promising to dine with them . The dinner , already ordered at the inn , was at last , though unwillingly , accepted as a excuse ; but they seemed almost hurt that Captain Wentworth should have brought any such party to Lyme , without considering it as a thing of course that they should dine with them .
austen#"There was so much attachment to Captain Wentworth in all this , and such a bewitching charm in a degree of hospitality so uncommon , so unlike the usual style of give - and - take invitations , and dinners of formality and display , that Anne felt her spirits not likely to be benefited by an increasing acquaintance among his brother - officers . "" These would have been all my friends ,"" was her thought ; and she had to struggle against a great tendency to lowness . On quitting the Cobb , they all went in - doors with their new friends , and found rooms so small as none but those who invite from the heart could think capable of accommodating so many . Anne had a moment ' s astonishment on the subject herself ; but it was soon lost in the pleasanter feelings which sprang from the sight of all the ingenious contrivances and nice arrangements of Captain Harville , to turn the actual space to the best account , to supply the deficiencies of lodging - house furniture , and defend the windows and doors against the winter storms to be expected . The varieties in the fitting - up of the rooms , where the common necessaries provided by the owner , in the common indifferent plight , were contrasted with some few articles of a rare species of wood , excellently worked up , and with something curious and valuable from all the distant countries Captain Harville had visited , were more than amusing to Anne ; connected as it all was with his profession , the fruit of its labours , the effect of its influence on his habits , the picture of repose and domestic happiness it presented , made it to her a something more , or less , than gratification . Captain Harville was no reader ; but he had contrived excellent accommodations , and fashioned very pretty shelves , for a tolerable collection of well - bound volumes , the property of Captain Benwick ."
austen#"His lameness prevented him from taking much exercise ; but a mind of usefulness and ingenuity seemed to furnish him with constant employment within . He drew , he varnished , he carpentered , he glued ; he made toys for the children ; he fashioned new netting - needles and pins with improvements ; and if everything else was done , sat down to his large fishing - net at one corner of the room . Anne thought she left great happiness behind her when they quitted the house ; and Louisa , by whom she found herself walking , burst forth into raptures of admiration and delight on the character of the navy ; their friendliness , their brotherliness , their openness , their uprightness ; protesting that she was convinced of sailors having more worth and warmth than any other set of men in England ; that they only knew how to live , and they only deserved to be respected and loved . They went back to dress and dine ; and so well had the scheme answered already , that nothing was found amiss ; though its being "" so entirely out of season ,"" and the "" no thoroughfare of Lyme ,"" and the "" no expectation of company ,"" had brought many apologies from the heads of the inn . Anne found herself by this time growing so much more hardened to being in Captain Wentworth ' s company than she had at first imagined could ever be , that the sitting down to the same table with him now , and the interchange of the common civilities attending on it ( they never got beyond ), was become a mere nothing . The nights were too dark for the ladies to meet again till the morrow , but Captain Harville had promised them a visit in the evening ; and he came , bringing his friend also , which was more than had been expected , it having been agreed that Captain Benwick had all the appearance of being oppressed by the presence of so many strangers ."
austen#He ventured among them again , however , though his spirits certainly did not seem fit for the mirth of the party in general . While Captains Wentworth and Harville led the talk on one side of the room , and by recurring to former days , supplied anecdotes in abundance to occupy and entertain the others , it fell to Anne ' s lot to be placed rather apart with Captain Benwick ; and a very good impulse of her nature obliged her to begin an acquaintance with him . He was shy , and disposed to abstraction ; but the engaging mildness of her countenance , and gentleness of her manners , soon had their effect ; and Anne was well repaid the first trouble of exertion . He was evidently a young man of considerable taste in reading , though principally in poetry ; and besides the persuasion of having given him at least an evening ' s indulgence in the discussion of subjects , which his usual companions had probably no concern in , she had the hope of being of real use to him in some suggestions as to the duty and benefit of struggling against affliction , which had naturally grown out of their conversation . For , though shy , he did not seem reserved ; it had rather the appearance of feelings glad to burst their usual restraints ; and having talked of poetry , the richness of the present age , and gone through a brief comparison of opinion as to the first - rate poets , trying to ascertain whether Marmion or The Lady of the Lake were to be preferred , and how ranked the Giaour and The Bride of Abydos ; and moreover , how the Giaour was to be pronounced , he showed himself so intimately acquainted with all the tenderest songs of the one poet , and all the impassioned descriptions of hopeless agony of the other ; he repeated , with such tremulous feeling , the various lines which imaged a broken heart , or a mind destroyed by wretchedness , and looked so entirely as if he meant to be understood , that she ventured to hope he did not always read only poetry , and to say , that she thought it was the misfortune of poetry to be seldom safely enjoyed by those who enjoyed it completely ; and that the strong feelings which alone could estimate it truly were the very feelings which ought to taste it but sparingly . His looks shewing him not pained , but pleased with this allusion to his situation , she was emboldened to go on ; and feeling in herself the right of seniority of mind , she ventured to recommend a larger allowance of prose in his daily study ; and on being requested to particularize , mentioned such works of our best moralists , such collections of the finest letters , such memoirs of characters of worth and suffering , as occurred to her at the moment as calculated to rouse and fortify the mind by the highest precepts , and the strongest examples of moral and religious endurances .
austen#Captain Benwick listened attentively , and seemed grateful for the interest implied ; and though with a shake of the head , and sighs which declared his little faith in the efficacy of any books on grief like his , noted down the names of those she recommended , and promised to procure and read them . When the evening was over , Anne could not but be amused at the idea of her coming to Lyme to preach patience and resignation to a young man whom she had never seen before ; nor could she help fearing , on more serious reflection , that , like many other great moralists and preachers , she had been eloquent on a point in which her own conduct would ill bear examination . Chapter 12 Anne and Henrietta , finding themselves the earliest of the party the next morning , agreed to stroll down to the sea before breakfast . They went to the sands , to watch the flowing of the tide , which a fine south - easterly breeze was bringing in with all the grandeur which so flat a shore admitted . They praised the morning ; gloried in the sea ; sympathized in the delight of the fresh - feeling breeze -- and were silent ; till Henrietta suddenly began again with --
austen#""" Oh ! yes ,-- I am quite convinced that , with very few exceptions , the sea - air always does good . There can be no doubt of its having been of the greatest service to Dr Shirley , after his illness , last spring twelve - month . He declares himself , that coming to Lyme for a month , did him more good than all the medicine he took ; and , that being by the sea , always makes him feel young again . Now , I cannot help thinking it a pity that he does not live entirely by the sea . I do think he had better leave Uppercross entirely , and fix at Lyme ."
austen#Do not you , Anne ? Do not you agree with me , that it is the best thing he could do , both for himself and Mrs Shirley ? She has cousins here , you know , and many acquaintance , which would make it cheerful for her , and I am sure she would be glad to get to a place where she could have medical attendance at hand , in case of his having another seizure . Indeed I think it quite melancholy to have such excellent people as Dr and Mrs Shirley , who have been doing good all their lives , wearing out their last days in a place like Uppercross , where , excepting our family , they seem shut out from all the world . I wish his friends would propose it to him . I really think they ought .
austen#"And , as to procuring a dispensation , there could be no difficulty at his time of life , and with his character . My only doubt is , whether anything could persuade him to leave his parish . He is so very strict and scrupulous in his notions ; over - scrupulous I must say . Do not you think , Anne , it is being over - scrupulous ? Do not you think it is quite a mistaken point of conscience , when a clergyman sacrifices his health for the sake of duties , which may be just as well performed by another person ? And at Lyme too , only seventeen miles off , he would be near enough to hear , if people thought there was anything to complain of ."""
austen#"Anne smiled more than once to herself during this speech , and entered into the subject , as ready to do good by entering into the feelings of a young lady as of a young man , though here it was good of a lower standard , for what could be offered but general acquiescence ? She said all that was reasonable and proper on the business ; felt the claims of Dr Shirley to repose as she ought ; saw how very desirable it was that he should have some active , respectable young man , as a resident curate , and was even courteous enough to hint at the advantage of such resident curate ' s being married . "" I wish ,"" said Henrietta , very well pleased with her companion , "" I wish Lady Russell lived at Uppercross , and were intimate with Dr Shirley . I have always heard of Lady Russell as a woman of the greatest influence with everybody ! I always look upon her as able to persuade a person to anything ! I am afraid of her , as I have told you before , quite afraid of her , because she is so very clever ; but I respect her amazingly , and wish we had such a neighbour at Uppercross ."""
austen#Anne was amused by Henrietta ' s manner of being grateful , and amused also that the course of events and the new interests of Henrietta ' s views should have placed her friend at all in favour with any of the Musgrove family ; she had only time , however , for a general answer , and a wish that such another woman were at Uppercross , before all subjects suddenly ceased , on seeing Louisa and Captain Wentworth coming towards them . They came also for a stroll till breakfast was likely to be ready ; but Louisa recollecting , immediately afterwards that she had something to procure at a shop , invited them all to go back with her into the town . They were all at her disposal . When they came to the steps , leading upwards from the beach , a gentleman , at the same moment preparing to come down , politely drew back , and stopped to give them way . They ascended and passed him ; and as they passed , Anne ' s face caught his eye , and he looked at her with a degree of earnest admiration , which she could not be insensible of . She was looking remarkably well ; her very regular , very pretty features , having the bloom and freshness of youth restored by the fine wind which had been blowing on her complexion , and by the animation of eye which it had also produced .
austen#"It was evident that the gentleman , ( completely a gentleman in manner ) admired her exceedingly . Captain Wentworth looked round at her instantly in a way which shewed his noticing of it . He gave her a momentary glance , a glance of brightness , which seemed to say , "" That man is struck with you , and even I , at this moment , see something like Anne Elliot again ."" After attending Louisa through her business , and loitering about a little longer , they returned to the inn ; and Anne , in passing afterwards quickly from her own chamber to their dining - room , had nearly run against the very same gentleman , as he came out of an adjoining apartment . She had before conjectured him to be a stranger like themselves , and determined that a well - looking groom , who was strolling about near the two inns as they came back , should be his servant . Both master and man being in mourning assisted the idea ."
austen#It was now proved that he belonged to the same inn as themselves ; and this second meeting , short as it was , also proved again by the gentleman ' s looks , that he thought hers very lovely , and by the readiness and propriety of his apologies , that he was a man of exceedingly good manners . He seemed about thirty , and though not handsome , had an agreeable person . Anne felt that she should like to know who he was . They had nearly done breakfast , when the sound of a carriage , ( almost the first they had heard since entering Lyme ) drew half the party to the window . It was a gentleman ' s carriage , a curricle , but only coming round from the stable - yard to the front door ; somebody must be going away . It was driven by a servant in mourning .
austen#"The word curricle made Charles Musgrove jump up that he might compare it with his own ; the servant in mourning roused Anne ' s curiosity , and the whole six were collected to look , by the time the owner of the curricle was to be seen issuing from the door amidst the bows and civilities of the household , and taking his seat , to drive off . "" Ah !"" cried Captain Wentworth , instantly , and with half a glance at Anne , "" it is the very man we passed ."" The Miss Musgroves agreed to it ; and having all kindly watched him as far up the hill as they could , they returned to the breakfast table . The waiter came into the room soon afterwards . "" Pray ,"" said Captain Wentworth , immediately , "" can you tell us the name of the gentleman who is just gone away ?"""
austen#""" Yes , Sir , a Mr Elliot , a gentleman of large fortune , came in last night from Sidmouth . Dare say you heard the carriage , sir , while you were at dinner ; and going on now for Crewkherne , in his way to Bath and London ."" "" Elliot !"" Many had looked on each other , and many had repeated the name , before all this had been got through , even by the smart rapidity of a waiter . "" Bless me !"" cried Mary ; "" it must be our cousin ; it must be our Mr Elliot , it must , indeed !"
austen#Charles , Anne , must not it ? In mourning , you see , just as our Mr Elliot must be . How very extraordinary ! In the very same inn with us ! Anne , must not it be our Mr Elliot ? my father ' s next heir ?
austen#"Pray sir ,"" turning to the waiter , "" did not you hear , did not his servant say whether he belonged to the Kellynch family ?"" "" No , ma ' am , he did not mention no particular family ; but he said his master was a very rich gentleman , and would be a baronight some day ."" "" There ! you see !"" cried Mary in an ecstasy , "" just as I said ! Heir to Sir Walter Elliot !"
austen#I was sure that would come out , if it was so . Depend upon it , that is a circumstance which his servants take care to publish , wherever he goes . But , Anne , only conceive how extraordinary ! I wish I had looked at him more . I wish we had been aware in time , who it was , that he might have been introduced to us . What a pity that we should not have been introduced to each other !
austen#"Do you think he had the Elliot countenance ? I hardly looked at him , I was looking at the horses ; but I think he had something of the Elliot countenance , I wonder the arms did not strike me ! Oh ! the great - coat was hanging over the panel , and hid the arms , so it did ; otherwise , I am sure , I should have observed them , and the livery too ; if the servant had not been in mourning , one should have known him by the livery ."" "" Putting all these very extraordinary circumstances together ,"" said Captain Wentworth , "" we must consider it to be the arrangement of Providence , that you should not be introduced to your cousin ."" When she could command Mary ' s attention , Anne quietly tried to convince her that their father and Mr Elliot had not , for many years , been on such terms as to make the power of attempting an introduction at all desirable ."
austen#"At the same time , however , it was a secret gratification to herself to have seen her cousin , and to know that the future owner of Kellynch was undoubtedly a gentleman , and had an air of good sense . She would not , upon any account , mention her having met with him the second time ; luckily Mary did not much attend to their having passed close by him in their earlier walk , but she would have felt quite ill - used by Anne ' s having actually run against him in the passage , and received his very polite excuses , while she had never been near him at all ; no , that cousinly little interview must remain a perfect secret . "" Of course ,"" said Mary , "" you will mention our seeing Mr Elliot , the next time you write to Bath . I think my father certainly ought to hear of it ; do mention all about him ."" Anne avoided a direct reply , but it was just the circumstance which she considered as not merely unnecessary to be communicated , but as what ought to be suppressed . The offence which had been given her father , many years back , she knew ; Elizabeth ' s particular share in it she suspected ; and that Mr Elliot ' s idea always produced irritation in both was beyond a doubt ."
austen#"Mary never wrote to Bath herself ; all the toil of keeping up a slow and unsatisfactory correspondence with Elizabeth fell on Anne . Breakfast had not been long over , when they were joined by Captain and Mrs Harville and Captain Benwick ; with whom they had appointed to take their last walk about Lyme . They ought to be setting off for Uppercross by one , and in the mean while were to be all together , and out of doors as long as they could . Anne found Captain Benwick getting near her , as soon as they were all fairly in the street . Their conversation the preceding evening did not disincline him to seek her again ; and they walked together some time , talking as before of Mr Scott and Lord Byron , and still as unable as before , and as unable as any other two readers , to think exactly alike of the merits of either , till something occasioned an almost general change amongst their party , and instead of Captain Benwick , she had Captain Harville by her side . "" Miss Elliot ,"" said he , speaking rather low , "" you have done a good deed in making that poor fellow talk so much ."
austen#"I wish he could have such company oftener . It is bad for him , I know , to be shut up as he is ; but what can we do ? We cannot part ."" "" No ,"" said Anne , "" that I can easily believe to be impossible ; but in time , perhaps -- we know what time does in every case of affliction , and you must remember , Captain Harville , that your friend may yet be called a young mourner -- only last summer , I understand ."" "" Ay , true enough ,"" ( with a deep sigh ) "" only June ."" "" And not known to him , perhaps , so soon ."""
austen#""" Not till the first week of August , when he came home from the Cape , just made into the Grappler . I was at Plymouth dreading to hear of him ; he sent in letters , but the Grappler was under orders for Portsmouth . There the news must follow him , but who was to tell it ? not I . I would as soon have been run up to the yard - arm . Nobody could do it , but that good fellow "" ( pointing to Captain Wentworth .) "" The Laconia had come into Plymouth the week before ; no danger of her being sent to sea again ."
austen#"He stood his chance for the rest ; wrote up for leave of absence , but without waiting the return , travelled night and day till he got to Portsmouth , rowed off to the Grappler that instant , and never left the poor fellow for a week . That ' s what he did , and nobody else could have saved poor James . You may think , Miss Elliot , whether he is dear to us !"" Anne did think on the question with perfect decision , and said as much in reply as her own feeling could accomplish , or as his seemed able to bear , for he was too much affected to renew the subject , and when he spoke again , it was of something totally different . Mrs Harville ' s giving it as her opinion that her husband would have quite walking enough by the time he reached home , determined the direction of all the party in what was to be their last walk ; they would accompany them to their door , and then return and set off themselves . By all their calculations there was just time for this ; but as they drew near the Cobb , there was such a general wish to walk along it once more , all were so inclined , and Louisa soon grew so determined , that the difference of a quarter of an hour , it was found , would be no difference at all ; so with all the kind leave - taking , and all the kind interchange of invitations and promises which may be imagined , they parted from Captain and Mrs Harville at their own door , and still accompanied by Captain Benwick , who seemed to cling to them to the last , proceeded to make the proper adieus to the Cobb ."
austen#"Anne found Captain Benwick again drawing near her . Lord Byron ' s "" dark blue seas "" could not fail of being brought forward by their present view , and she gladly gave him all her attention as long as attention was possible . It was soon drawn , perforce another way . There was too much wind to make the high part of the new Cobb pleasant for the ladies , and they agreed to get down the steps to the lower , and all were contented to pass quietly and carefully down the steep flight , excepting Louisa ; she must be jumped down them by Captain Wentworth . In all their walks , he had had to jump her from the stiles ; the sensation was delightful to her . The hardness of the pavement for her feet , made him less willing upon the present occasion ; he did it , however ."
austen#"She was safely down , and instantly , to show her enjoyment , ran up the steps to be jumped down again . He advised her against it , thought the jar too great ; but no , he reasoned and talked in vain , she smiled and said , "" I am determined I will :"" he put out his hands ; she was too precipitate by half a second , she fell on the pavement on the Lower Cobb , and was taken up lifeless ! There was no wound , no blood , no visible bruise ; but her eyes were closed , she breathed not , her face was like death . The horror of the moment to all who stood around ! Captain Wentworth , who had caught her up , knelt with her in his arms , looking on her with a face as pallid as her own , in an agony of silence . "" She is dead !"
austen#"she is dead !"" screamed Mary , catching hold of her husband , and contributing with his own horror to make him immoveable ; and in another moment , Henrietta , sinking under the conviction , lost her senses too , and would have fallen on the steps , but for Captain Benwick and Anne , who caught and supported her between them . "" Is there no one to help me ?"" were the first words which burst from Captain Wentworth , in a tone of despair , and as if all his own strength were gone . "" Go to him , go to him ,"" cried Anne , "" for heaven ' s sake go to him . I can support her myself ."
austen#"Leave me , and go to him . Rub her hands , rub her temples ; here are salts ; take them , take them ."" Captain Benwick obeyed , and Charles at the same moment , disengaging himself from his wife , they were both with him ; and Louisa was raised up and supported more firmly between them , and everything was done that Anne had prompted , but in vain ; while Captain Wentworth , staggering against the wall for his support , exclaimed in the bitterest agony -- "" Oh God ! her father and mother !"" "" A surgeon !"""
austen#"said Anne . He caught the word ; it seemed to rouse him at once , and saying only -- "" True , true , a surgeon this instant ,"" was darting away , when Anne eagerly suggested -- "" Captain Benwick , would not it be better for Captain Benwick ? He knows where a surgeon is to be found ."" Every one capable of thinking felt the advantage of the idea , and in a moment ( it was all done in rapid moments ) Captain Benwick had resigned the poor corpse - like figure entirely to the brother ' s care , and was off for the town with the utmost rapidity . As to the wretched party left behind , it could scarcely be said which of the three , who were completely rational , was suffering most : Captain Wentworth , Anne , or Charles , who , really a very affectionate brother , hung over Louisa with sobs of grief , and could only turn his eyes from one sister , to see the other in a state as insensible , or to witness the hysterical agitations of his wife , calling on him for help which he could not give ."
austen#"Anne , attending with all the strength and zeal , and thought , which instinct supplied , to Henrietta , still tried , at intervals , to suggest comfort to the others , tried to quiet Mary , to animate Charles , to assuage the feelings of Captain Wentworth . Both seemed to look to her for directions . "" Anne , Anne ,"" cried Charles , "" What is to be done next ? What , in heaven ' s name , is to be done next ?"" Captain Wentworth ' s eyes were also turned towards her . "" Had not she better be carried to the inn ?"
austen#"Yes , I am sure : carry her gently to the inn ."" "" Yes , yes , to the inn ,"" repeated Captain Wentworth , comparatively collected , and eager to be doing something . "" I will carry her myself . Musgrove , take care of the others ."" By this time the report of the accident had spread among the workmen and boatmen about the Cobb , and many were collected near them , to be useful if wanted , at any rate , to enjoy the sight of a dead young lady , nay , two dead young ladies , for it proved twice as fine as the first report . To some of the best - looking of these good people Henrietta was consigned , for , though partially revived , she was quite helpless ; and in this manner , Anne walking by her side , and Charles attending to his wife , they set forward , treading back with feelings unutterable , the ground , which so lately , so very lately , and so light of heart , they had passed along ."
austen#They were not off the Cobb , before the Harvilles met them . Captain Benwick had been seen flying by their house , with a countenance which showed something to be wrong ; and they had set off immediately , informed and directed as they passed , towards the spot . Shocked as Captain Harville was , he brought senses and nerves that could be instantly useful ; and a look between him and his wife decided what was to be done . She must be taken to their house ; all must go to their house ; and await the surgeon ' s arrival there . They would not listen to scruples : he was obeyed ; they were all beneath his roof ; and while Louisa , under Mrs Harville ' s direction , was conveyed up stairs , and given possession of her own bed , assistance , cordials , restoratives were supplied by her husband to all who needed them . Louisa had once opened her eyes , but soon closed them again , without apparent consciousness .
austen#This had been a proof of life , however , of service to her sister ; and Henrietta , though perfectly incapable of being in the same room with Louisa , was kept , by the agitation of hope and fear , from a return of her own insensibility . Mary , too , was growing calmer . The surgeon was with them almost before it had seemed possible . They were sick with horror , while he examined ; but he was not hopeless . The head had received a severe contusion , but he had seen greater injuries recovered from : he was by no means hopeless ; he spoke cheerfully . That he did not regard it as a desperate case , that he did not say a few hours must end it , was at first felt , beyond the hope of most ; and the ecstasy of such a reprieve , the rejoicing , deep and silent , after a few fervent ejaculations of gratitude to Heaven had been offered , may be conceived .
austen#"The tone , the look , with which "" Thank God !"" was uttered by Captain Wentworth , Anne was sure could never be forgotten by her ; nor the sight of him afterwards , as he sat near a table , leaning over it with folded arms and face concealed , as if overpowered by the various feelings of his soul , and trying by prayer and reflection to calm them . Louisa ' s limbs had escaped . There was no injury but to the head . It now became necessary for the party to consider what was best to be done , as to their general situation . They were now able to speak to each other and consult ."
austen#"That Louisa must remain where she was , however distressing to her friends to be involving the Harvilles in such trouble , did not admit a doubt . Her removal was impossible . The Harvilles silenced all scruples ; and , as much as they could , all gratitude . They had looked forward and arranged everything before the others began to reflect . Captain Benwick must give up his room to them , and get another bed elsewhere ; and the whole was settled . They were only concerned that the house could accommodate no more ; and yet perhaps , by "" putting the children away in the maid ' s room , or swinging a cot somewhere ,"" they could hardly bear to think of not finding room for two or three besides , supposing they might wish to stay ; though , with regard to any attendance on Miss Musgrove , there need not be the least uneasiness in leaving her to Mrs Harville ' s care entirely ."
austen#"Mrs Harville was a very experienced nurse , and her nursery - maid , who had lived with her long , and gone about with her everywhere , was just such another . Between these two , she could want no possible attendance by day or night . And all this was said with a truth and sincerity of feeling irresistible . Charles , Henrietta , and Captain Wentworth were the three in consultation , and for a little while it was only an interchange of perplexity and terror . "" Uppercross , the necessity of some one ' s going to Uppercross ; the news to be conveyed ; how it could be broken to Mr and Mrs Musgrove ; the lateness of the morning ; an hour already gone since they ought to have been off ; the impossibility of being in tolerable time ."" At first , they were capable of nothing more to the purpose than such exclamations ; but , after a while , Captain Wentworth , exerting himself , said --"
austen#""" We must be decided , and without the loss of another minute . Every minute is valuable . Some one must resolve on being off for Uppercross instantly . Musgrove , either you or I must go ."" Charles agreed , but declared his resolution of not going away . He would be as little incumbrance as possible to Captain and Mrs Harville ; but as to leaving his sister in such a state , he neither ought , nor would ."
austen#So far it was decided ; and Henrietta at first declared the same . She , however , was soon persuaded to think differently . The usefulness of her staying ! She who had not been able to remain in Louisa ' s room , or to look at her , without sufferings which made her worse than helpless ! She was forced to acknowledge that she could do no good , yet was still unwilling to be away , till , touched by the thought of her father and mother , she gave it up ; she consented , she was anxious to be at home . The plan had reached this point , when Anne , coming quietly down from Louisa ' s room , could not but hear what followed , for the parlour door was open .
austen#""" Then it is settled , Musgrove ,"" cried Captain Wentworth , "" that you stay , and that I take care of your sister home . But as to the rest , as to the others , if one stays to assist Mrs Harville , I think it need be only one . Mrs Charles Musgrove will , of course , wish to get back to her children ; but if Anne will stay , no one so proper , so capable as Anne ."" She paused a moment to recover from the emotion of hearing herself so spoken of . The other two warmly agreed with what he said , and she then appeared . "" You will stay , I am sure ; you will stay and nurse her ;"" cried he , turning to her and speaking with a glow , and yet a gentleness , which seemed almost restoring the past ."
austen#"She coloured deeply , and he recollected himself and moved away . She expressed herself most willing , ready , happy to remain . "" It was what she had been thinking of , and wishing to be allowed to do . A bed on the floor in Louisa ' s room would be sufficient for her , if Mrs Harville would but think so ."" One thing more , and all seemed arranged . Though it was rather desirable that Mr and Mrs Musgrove should be previously alarmed by some share of delay ; yet the time required by the Uppercross horses to take them back , would be a dreadful extension of suspense ; and Captain Wentworth proposed , and Charles Musgrove agreed , that it would be much better for him to take a chaise from the inn , and leave Mr Musgrove ' s carriage and horses to be sent home the next morning early , when there would be the farther advantage of sending an account of Louisa ' s night ."
austen#Captain Wentworth now hurried off to get everything ready on his part , and to be soon followed by the two ladies . When the plan was made known to Mary , however , there was an end of all peace in it . She was so wretched and so vehement , complained so much of injustice in being expected to go away instead of Anne ; Anne , who was nothing to Louisa , while she was her sister , and had the best right to stay in Henrietta ' s stead ! Why was not she to be as useful as Anne ? And to go home without Charles , too , without her husband ! No , it was too unkind .
austen#And in short , she said more than her husband could long withstand , and as none of the others could oppose when he gave way , there was no help for it ; the change of Mary for Anne was inevitable . Anne had never submitted more reluctantly to the jealous and ill - judging claims of Mary ; but so it must be , and they set off for the town , Charles taking care of his sister , and Captain Benwick attending to her . She gave a moment ' s recollection , as they hurried along , to the little circumstances which the same spots had witnessed earlier in the morning . There she had listened to Henrietta ' s schemes for Dr Shirley ' s leaving Uppercross ; farther on , she had first seen Mr Elliot ; a moment seemed all that could now be given to any one but Louisa , or those who were wrapt up in her welfare . Captain Benwick was most considerately attentive to her ; and , united as they all seemed by the distress of the day , she felt an increasing degree of good - will towards him , and a pleasure even in thinking that it might , perhaps , be the occasion of continuing their acquaintance . Captain Wentworth was on the watch for them , and a chaise and four in waiting , stationed for their convenience in the lowest part of the street ; but his evident surprise and vexation at the substitution of one sister for the other , the change in his countenance , the astonishment , the expressions begun and suppressed , with which Charles was listened to , made but a mortifying reception of Anne ; or must at least convince her that she was valued only as she could be useful to Louisa .
austen#She endeavoured to be composed , and to be just . Without emulating the feelings of an Emma towards her Henry , she would have attended on Louisa with a zeal above the common claims of regard , for his sake ; and she hoped he would not long be so unjust as to suppose she would shrink unnecessarily from the office of a friend . In the mean while she was in the carriage . He had handed them both in , and placed himself between them ; and in this manner , under these circumstances , full of astonishment and emotion to Anne , she quitted Lyme . How the long stage would pass ; how it was to affect their manners ; what was to be their sort of intercourse , she could not foresee . It was all quite natural , however .
austen#"He was devoted to Henrietta ; always turning towards her ; and when he spoke at all , always with the view of supporting her hopes and raising her spirits . In general , his voice and manner were studiously calm . To spare Henrietta from agitation seemed the governing principle . Once only , when she had been grieving over the last ill - judged , ill - fated walk to the Cobb , bitterly lamenting that it ever had been thought of , he burst forth , as if wholly overcome -- "" Don ' t talk of it , don ' t talk of it ,"" he cried . "" Oh God !"
austen#"that I had not given way to her at the fatal moment ! Had I done as I ought ! But so eager and so resolute ! Dear , sweet Louisa !"" Anne wondered whether it ever occurred to him now , to question the justness of his own previous opinion as to the universal felicity and advantage of firmness of character ; and whether it might not strike him that , like all other qualities of the mind , it should have its proportions and limits . She thought it could scarcely escape him to feel that a persuadable temper might sometimes be as much in favour of happiness as a very resolute character ."
austen#"They got on fast . Anne was astonished to recognise the same hills and the same objects so soon . Their actual speed , heightened by some dread of the conclusion , made the road appear but half as long as on the day before . It was growing quite dusk , however , before they were in the neighbourhood of Uppercross , and there had been total silence among them for some time , Henrietta leaning back in the corner , with a shawl over her face , giving the hope of her having cried herself to sleep ; when , as they were going up their last hill , Anne found herself all at once addressed by Captain Wentworth . In a low , cautious voice , he said : -- "" I have been considering what we had best do ."
austen#"She must not appear at first . She could not stand it . I have been thinking whether you had not better remain in the carriage with her , while I go in and break it to Mr and Mrs Musgrove . Do you think this is a good plan ?"" She did : he was satisfied , and said no more . But the remembrance of the appeal remained a pleasure to her , as a proof of friendship , and of deference for her judgement , a great pleasure ; and when it became a sort of parting proof , its value did not lessen ."
austen#When the distressing communication at Uppercross was over , and he had seen the father and mother quite as composed as could be hoped , and the daughter all the better for being with them , he announced his intention of returning in the same carriage to Lyme ; and when the horses were baited , he was off . ( End of volume one .) Chapter 13 The remainder of Anne ' s time at Uppercross , comprehending only two days , was spent entirely at the Mansion House ; and she had the satisfaction of knowing herself extremely useful there , both as an immediate companion , and as assisting in all those arrangements for the future , which , in Mr and Mrs Musgrove ' s distressed state of spirits , would have been difficulties . They had an early account from Lyme the next morning . Louisa was much the same .
austen#"No symptoms worse than before had appeared . Charles came a few hours afterwards , to bring a later and more particular account . He was tolerably cheerful . A speedy cure must not be hoped , but everything was going on as well as the nature of the case admitted . In speaking of the Harvilles , he seemed unable to satisfy his own sense of their kindness , especially of Mrs Harville ' s exertions as a nurse . "" She really left nothing for Mary to do ."
austen#"He and Mary had been persuaded to go early to their inn last night . Mary had been hysterical again this morning . When he came away , she was going to walk out with Captain Benwick , which , he hoped , would do her good . He almost wished she had been prevailed on to come home the day before ; but the truth was , that Mrs Harville left nothing for anybody to do ."" Charles was to return to Lyme the same afternoon , and his father had at first half a mind to go with him , but the ladies could not consent . It would be going only to multiply trouble to the others , and increase his own distress ; and a much better scheme followed and was acted upon ."
austen#A chaise was sent for from Crewkherne , and Charles conveyed back a far more useful person in the old nursery - maid of the family , one who having brought up all the children , and seen the very last , the lingering and long - petted Master Harry , sent to school after his brothers , was now living in her deserted nursery to mend stockings and dress all the blains and bruises she could get near her , and who , consequently , was only too happy in being allowed to go and help nurse dear Miss Louisa . Vague wishes of getting Sarah thither , had occurred before to Mrs Musgrove and Henrietta ; but without Anne , it would hardly have been resolved on , and found practicable so soon . They were indebted , the next day , to Charles Hayter , for all the minute knowledge of Louisa , which it was so essential to obtain every twenty - four hours . He made it his business to go to Lyme , and his account was still encouraging . The intervals of sense and consciousness were believed to be stronger . Every report agreed in Captain Wentworth ' s appearing fixed in Lyme .
austen#"Anne was to leave them on the morrow , an event which they all dreaded . "" What should they do without her ? They were wretched comforters for one another ."" And so much was said in this way , that Anne thought she could not do better than impart among them the general inclination to which she was privy , and persuaded them all to go to Lyme at once . She had little difficulty ; it was soon determined that they would go ; go to - morrow , fix themselves at the inn , or get into lodgings , as it suited , and there remain till dear Louisa could be moved . They must be taking off some trouble from the good people she was with ; they might at least relieve Mrs Harville from the care of her own children ; and in short , they were so happy in the decision , that Anne was delighted with what she had done , and felt that she could not spend her last morning at Uppercross better than in assisting their preparations , and sending them off at an early hour , though her being left to the solitary range of the house was the consequence ."
austen#She was the last , excepting the little boys at the cottage , she was the very last , the only remaining one of all that had filled and animated both houses , of all that had given Uppercross its cheerful character . A few days had made a change indeed ! If Louisa recovered , it would all be well again . More than former happiness would be restored . There could not be a doubt , to her mind there was none , of what would follow her recovery . A few months hence , and the room now so deserted , occupied but by her silent , pensive self , might be filled again with all that was happy and gay , all that was glowing and bright in prosperous love , all that was most unlike Anne Elliot !
austen#An hour ' s complete leisure for such reflections as these , on a dark November day , a small thick rain almost blotting out the very few objects ever to be discerned from the windows , was enough to make the sound of Lady Russell ' s carriage exceedingly welcome ; and yet , though desirous to be gone , she could not quit the Mansion House , or look an adieu to the Cottage , with its black , dripping and comfortless veranda , or even notice through the misty glasses the last humble tenements of the village , without a saddened heart . Scenes had passed in Uppercross which made it precious . It stood the record of many sensations of pain , once severe , but now softened ; and of some instances of relenting feeling , some breathings of friendship and reconciliation , which could never be looked for again , and which could never cease to be dear . She left it all behind her , all but the recollection that such things had been . Anne had never entered Kellynch since her quitting Lady Russell ' s house in September . It had not been necessary , and the few occasions of its being possible for her to go to the Hall she had contrived to evade and escape from .
austen#Her first return was to resume her place in the modern and elegant apartments of the Lodge , and to gladden the eyes of its mistress . There was some anxiety mixed with Lady Russell ' s joy in meeting her . She knew who had been frequenting Uppercross . But happily , either Anne was improved in plumpness and looks , or Lady Russell fancied her so ; and Anne , in receiving her compliments on the occasion , had the amusement of connecting them with the silent admiration of her cousin , and of hoping that she was to be blessed with a second spring of youth and beauty . When they came to converse , she was soon sensible of some mental change . The subjects of which her heart had been full on leaving Kellynch , and which she had felt slighted , and been compelled to smother among the Musgroves , were now become but of secondary interest .
austen#She had lately lost sight even of her father and sister and Bath . Their concerns had been sunk under those of Uppercross ; and when Lady Russell reverted to their former hopes and fears , and spoke her satisfaction in the house in Camden Place , which had been taken , and her regret that Mrs Clay should still be with them , Anne would have been ashamed to have it known how much more she was thinking of Lyme and Louisa Musgrove , and all her acquaintance there ; how much more interesting to her was the home and the friendship of the Harvilles and Captain Benwick , than her own father ' s house in Camden Place , or her own sister ' s intimacy with Mrs Clay . She was actually forced to exert herself to meet Lady Russell with anything like the appearance of equal solicitude , on topics which had by nature the first claim on her . There was a little awkwardness at first in their discourse on another subject . They must speak of the accident at Lyme . Lady Russell had not been arrived five minutes the day before , when a full account of the whole had burst on her ; but still it must be talked of , she must make enquiries , she must regret the imprudence , lament the result , and Captain Wentworth ' s name must be mentioned by both .
austen#"Anne was conscious of not doing it so well as Lady Russell . She could not speak the name , and look straight forward to Lady Russell ' s eye , till she had adopted the expedient of telling her briefly what she thought of the attachment between him and Louisa . When this was told , his name distressed her no longer . Lady Russell had only to listen composedly , and wish them happy , but internally her heart revelled in angry pleasure , in pleased contempt , that the man who at twenty - three had seemed to understand somewhat of the value of an Anne Elliot , should , eight years afterwards , be charmed by a Louisa Musgrove . The first three or four days passed most quietly , with no circumstance to mark them excepting the receipt of a note or two from Lyme , which found their way to Anne , she could not tell how , and brought a rather improving account of Louisa . At the end of that period , Lady Russell ' s politeness could repose no longer , and the fainter self - threatenings of the past became in a decided tone , "" I must call on Mrs Croft ; I really must call upon her soon ."
austen#"Anne , have you courage to go with me , and pay a visit in that house ? It will be some trial to us both ."" Anne did not shrink from it ; on the contrary , she truly felt as she said , in observing -- "" I think you are very likely to suffer the most of the two ; your feelings are less reconciled to the change than mine . By remaining in the neighbourhood , I am become inured to it ."" She could have said more on the subject ; for she had in fact so high an opinion of the Crofts , and considered her father so very fortunate in his tenants , felt the parish to be so sure of a good example , and the poor of the best attention and relief , that however sorry and ashamed for the necessity of the removal , she could not but in conscience feel that they were gone who deserved not to stay , and that Kellynch Hall had passed into better hands than its owners '."
austen#"These convictions must unquestionably have their own pain , and severe was its kind ; but they precluded that pain which Lady Russell would suffer in entering the house again , and returning through the well - known apartments . In such moments Anne had no power of saying to herself , "" These rooms ought to belong only to us . Oh , how fallen in their destination ! How unworthily occupied ! An ancient family to be so driven away ! Strangers filling their place !"""
austen#No , except when she thought of her mother , and remembered where she had been used to sit and preside , she had no sigh of that description to heave . Mrs Croft always met her with a kindness which gave her the pleasure of fancying herself a favourite , and on the present occasion , receiving her in that house , there was particular attention . The sad accident at Lyme was soon the prevailing topic , and on comparing their latest accounts of the invalid , it appeared that each lady dated her intelligence from the same hour of yestermorn ; that Captain Wentworth had been in Kellynch yesterday ( the first time since the accident ), had brought Anne the last note , which she had not been able to trace the exact steps of ; had staid a few hours and then returned again to Lyme , and without any present intention of quitting it any more . He had enquired after her , she found , particularly ; had expressed his hope of Miss Elliot ' s not being the worse for her exertions , and had spoken of those exertions as great . This was handsome , and gave her more pleasure than almost anything else could have done . As to the sad catastrophe itself , it could be canvassed only in one style by a couple of steady , sensible women , whose judgements had to work on ascertained events ; and it was perfectly decided that it had been the consequence of much thoughtlessness and much imprudence ; that its effects were most alarming , and that it was frightful to think , how long Miss Musgrove ' s recovery might yet be doubtful , and how liable she would still remain to suffer from the concussion hereafter !
austen#"The Admiral wound it up summarily by exclaiming -- "" Ay , a very bad business indeed . A new sort of way this , for a young fellow to be making love , by breaking his mistress ' s head , is not it , Miss Elliot ? This is breaking a head and giving a plaster , truly !"" Admiral Croft ' s manners were not quite of the tone to suit Lady Russell , but they delighted Anne . His goodness of heart and simplicity of character were irresistible ."
austen#""" Now , this must be very bad for you ,"" said he , suddenly rousing from a little reverie , "" to be coming and finding us here . I had not recollected it before , I declare , but it must be very bad . But now , do not stand upon ceremony . Get up and go over all the rooms in the house if you like it ."" "" Another time , Sir , I thank you , not now ."" "" Well , whenever it suits you ."
austen#"You can slip in from the shrubbery at any time ; and there you will find we keep our umbrellas hanging up by that door . A good place is not it ? But ,"" ( checking himself ), "" you will not think it a good place , for yours were always kept in the butler ' s room . Ay , so it always is , I believe . One man ' s ways may be as good as another ' s , but we all like our own best . And so you must judge for yourself , whether it would be better for you to go about the house or not ."""
austen#"Anne , finding she might decline it , did so , very gratefully . "" We have made very few changes either ,"" continued the Admiral , after thinking a moment . "" Very few . We told you about the laundry - door , at Uppercross . That has been a very great improvement . The wonder was , how any family upon earth could bear with the inconvenience of its opening as it did , so long !"
austen#"You will tell Sir Walter what we have done , and that Mr Shepherd thinks it the greatest improvement the house ever had . Indeed , I must do ourselves the justice to say , that the few alterations we have made have been all very much for the better . My wife should have the credit of them , however . I have done very little besides sending away some of the large looking - glasses from my dressing - room , which was your father ' s . A very good man , and very much the gentleman I am sure : but I should think , Miss Elliot ,"" ( looking with serious reflection ), "" I should think he must be rather a dressy man for his time of life . Such a number of looking - glasses !"
austen#"oh Lord ! there was no getting away from one ' s self . So I got Sophy to lend me a hand , and we soon shifted their quarters ; and now I am quite snug , with my little shaving glass in one corner , and another great thing that I never go near ."" Anne , amused in spite of herself , was rather distressed for an answer , and the Admiral , fearing he might not have been civil enough , took up the subject again , to say -- "" The next time you write to your good father , Miss Elliot , pray give him my compliments and Mrs Croft ' s , and say that we are settled here quite to our liking , and have no fault at all to find with the place . The breakfast - room chimney smokes a little , I grant you , but it is only when the wind is due north and blows hard , which may not happen three times a winter ."
austen#"And take it altogether , now that we have been into most of the houses hereabouts and can judge , there is not one that we like better than this . Pray say so , with my compliments . He will be glad to hear it ."" Lady Russell and Mrs Croft were very well pleased with each other : but the acquaintance which this visit began was fated not to proceed far at present ; for when it was returned , the Crofts announced themselves to be going away for a few weeks , to visit their connexions in the north of the county , and probably might not be at home again before Lady Russell would be removing to Bath . So ended all danger to Anne of meeting Captain Wentworth at Kellynch Hall , or of seeing him in company with her friend . Everything was safe enough , and she smiled over the many anxious feelings she had wasted on the subject ."
austen#Chapter 14 Though Charles and Mary had remained at Lyme much longer after Mr and Mrs Musgrove ' s going than Anne conceived they could have been at all wanted , they were yet the first of the family to be at home again ; and as soon as possible after their return to Uppercross they drove over to the Lodge . They had left Louisa beginning to sit up ; but her head , though clear , was exceedingly weak , and her nerves susceptible to the highest extreme of tenderness ; and though she might be pronounced to be altogether doing very well , it was still impossible to say when she might be able to bear the removal home ; and her father and mother , who must return in time to receive their younger children for the Christmas holidays , had hardly a hope of being allowed to bring her with them . They had been all in lodgings together . Mrs Musgrove had got Mrs Harville ' s children away as much as she could , every possible supply from Uppercross had been furnished , to lighten the inconvenience to the Harvilles , while the Harvilles had been wanting them to come to dinner every day ; and in short , it seemed to have been only a struggle on each side as to which should be most disinterested and hospitable . Mary had had her evils ; but upon the whole , as was evident by her staying so long , she had found more to enjoy than to suffer .
austen#"Charles Hayter had been at Lyme oftener than suited her ; and when they dined with the Harvilles there had been only a maid - servant to wait , and at first Mrs Harville had always given Mrs Musgrove precedence ; but then , she had received so very handsome an apology from her on finding out whose daughter she was , and there had been so much going on every day , there had been so many walks between their lodgings and the Harvilles , and she had got books from the library , and changed them so often , that the balance had certainly been much in favour of Lyme . She had been taken to Charmouth too , and she had bathed , and she had gone to church , and there were a great many more people to look at in the church at Lyme than at Uppercross ; and all this , joined to the sense of being so very useful , had made really an agreeable fortnight . Anne enquired after Captain Benwick , Mary ' s face was clouded directly . Charles laughed . "" Oh ! Captain Benwick is very well , I believe , but he is a very odd young man ."
austen#"I do not know what he would be at . We asked him to come home with us for a day or two : Charles undertook to give him some shooting , and he seemed quite delighted , and , for my part , I thought it was all settled ; when behold ! on Tuesday night , he made a very awkward sort of excuse ; ` he never shot ' and he had ` been quite misunderstood ,' and he had promised this and he had promised that , and the end of it was , I found , that he did not mean to come . I suppose he was afraid of finding it dull ; but upon my word I should have thought we were lively enough at the Cottage for such a heart - broken man as Captain Benwick ."" Charles laughed again and said , "" Now Mary , you know very well how it really was . It was all your doing ,"" ( turning to Anne .)"
austen#""" He fancied that if he went with us , he should find you close by : he fancied everybody to be living in Uppercross ; and when he discovered that Lady Russell lived three miles off , his heart failed him , and he had not courage to come . That is the fact , upon my honour , Mary knows it is ."" But Mary did not give into it very graciously , whether from not considering Captain Benwick entitled by birth and situation to be in love with an Elliot , or from not wanting to believe Anne a greater attraction to Uppercross than herself , must be left to be guessed . Anne ' s good - will , however , was not to be lessened by what she heard . She boldly acknowledged herself flattered , and continued her enquiries . "" Oh !"
austen#"he talks of you ,"" cried Charles , "" in such terms --"" Mary interrupted him . "" I declare , Charles , I never heard him mention Anne twice all the time I was there . I declare , Anne , he never talks of you at all ."" "" No ,"" admitted Charles , "" I do not know that he ever does , in a general way ; but however , it is a very clear thing that he admires you exceedingly . His head is full of some books that he is reading upon your recommendation , and he wants to talk to you about them ; he has found out something or other in one of them which he thinks -- oh ! I cannot pretend to remember it , but it was something very fine -- I overheard him telling Henrietta all about it ; and then ` Miss Elliot ' was spoken of in the highest terms !"
austen#"Now Mary , I declare it was so , I heard it myself , and you were in the other room . ` Elegance , sweetness , beauty .' Oh ! there was no end of Miss Elliot ' s charms ."" "" And I am sure ,"" cried Mary , warmly , "" it was a very little to his credit , if he did . Miss Harville only died last June ."
austen#"Such a heart is very little worth having ; is it , Lady Russell ? I am sure you will agree with me ."" "" I must see Captain Benwick before I decide ,"" said Lady Russell , smiling . "" And that you are very likely to do very soon , I can tell you , ma ' am ,"" said Charles . "" Though he had not nerves for coming away with us , and setting off again afterwards to pay a formal visit here , he will make his way over to Kellynch one day by himself , you may depend on it . I told him the distance and the road , and I told him of the church ' s being so very well worth seeing ; for as he has a taste for those sort of things , I thought that would be a good excuse , and he listened with all his understanding and soul ; and I am sure from his manner that you will have him calling here soon ."
austen#"So , I give you notice , Lady Russell ."" "" Any acquaintance of Anne ' s will always be welcome to me ,"" was Lady Russell ' s kind answer . "" Oh ! as to being Anne ' s acquaintance ,"" said Mary , "" I think he is rather my acquaintance , for I have been seeing him every day this last fortnight ."" "" Well , as your joint acquaintance , then , I shall be very happy to see Captain Benwick ."" "" You will not find anything very agreeable in him , I assure you , ma ' am ."
austen#"He is one of the dullest young men that ever lived . He has walked with me , sometimes , from one end of the sands to the other , without saying a word . He is not at all a well - bred young man . I am sure you will not like him ."" "" There we differ , Mary ,"" said Anne . "" I think Lady Russell would like him ."
austen#"I think she would be so much pleased with his mind , that she would very soon see no deficiency in his manner ."" "" So do I , Anne ,"" said Charles . "" I am sure Lady Russell would like him . He is just Lady Russell ' s sort . Give him a book , and he will read all day long ."" "" Yes , that he will !"""
austen#"exclaimed Mary , tauntingly . "" He will sit poring over his book , and not know when a person speaks to him , or when one drop ' s one ' s scissors , or anything that happens . Do you think Lady Russell would like that ?"" Lady Russell could not help laughing . "" Upon my word ,"" said she , "" I should not have supposed that my opinion of any one could have admitted of such difference of conjecture , steady and matter of fact as I may call myself . I have really a curiosity to see the person who can give occasion to such directly opposite notions ."
austen#"I wish he may be induced to call here . And when he does , Mary , you may depend upon hearing my opinion ; but I am determined not to judge him beforehand ."" "" You will not like him , I will answer for it ."" Lady Russell began talking of something else . Mary spoke with animation of their meeting with , or rather missing , Mr Elliot so extraordinarily . "" He is a man ,"" said Lady Russell , "" whom I have no wish to see ."
austen#"His declining to be on cordial terms with the head of his family , has left a very strong impression in his disfavour with me ."" This decision checked Mary ' s eagerness , and stopped her short in the midst of the Elliot countenance . With regard to Captain Wentworth , though Anne hazarded no enquiries , there was voluntary communication sufficient . His spirits had been greatly recovering lately as might be expected . As Louisa improved , he had improved , and he was now quite a different creature from what he had been the first week . He had not seen Louisa ; and was so extremely fearful of any ill consequence to her from an interview , that he did not press for it at all ; and , on the contrary , seemed to have a plan of going away for a week or ten days , till her head was stronger ."
austen#He had talked of going down to Plymouth for a week , and wanted to persuade Captain Benwick to go with him ; but , as Charles maintained to the last , Captain Benwick seemed much more disposed to ride over to Kellynch . There can be no doubt that Lady Russell and Anne were both occasionally thinking of Captain Benwick , from this time . Lady Russell could not hear the door - bell without feeling that it might be his herald ; nor could Anne return from any stroll of solitary indulgence in her father ' s grounds , or any visit of charity in the village , without wondering whether she might see him or hear of him . Captain Benwick came not , however . He was either less disposed for it than Charles had imagined , or he was too shy ; and after giving him a week ' s indulgence , Lady Russell determined him to be unworthy of the interest which he had been beginning to excite . The Musgroves came back to receive their happy boys and girls from school , bringing with them Mrs Harville ' s little children , to improve the noise of Uppercross , and lessen that of Lyme .
austen#Henrietta remained with Louisa ; but all the rest of the family were again in their usual quarters . Lady Russell and Anne paid their compliments to them once , when Anne could not but feel that Uppercross was already quite alive again . Though neither Henrietta , nor Louisa , nor Charles Hayter , nor Captain Wentworth were there , the room presented as strong a contrast as could be wished to the last state she had seen it in . Immediately surrounding Mrs Musgrove were the little Harvilles , whom she was sedulously guarding from the tyranny of the two children from the Cottage , expressly arrived to amuse them . On one side was a table occupied by some chattering girls , cutting up silk and gold paper ; and on the other were tressels and trays , bending under the weight of brawn and cold pies , where riotous boys were holding high revel ; the whole completed by a roaring Christmas fire , which seemed determined to be heard , in spite of all the noise of the others . Charles and Mary also came in , of course , during their visit , and Mr Musgrove made a point of paying his respects to Lady Russell , and sat down close to her for ten minutes , talking with a very raised voice , but from the clamour of the children on his knees , generally in vain .
austen#It was a fine family - piece . Anne , judging from her own temperament , would have deemed such a domestic hurricane a bad restorative of the nerves , which Louisa ' s illness must have so greatly shaken . But Mrs Musgrove , who got Anne near her on purpose to thank her most cordially , again and again , for all her attentions to them , concluded a short recapitulation of what she had suffered herself by observing , with a happy glance round the room , that after all she had gone through , nothing was so likely to do her good as a little quiet cheerfulness at home . Louisa was now recovering apace . Her mother could even think of her being able to join their party at home , before her brothers and sisters went to school again . The Harvilles had promised to come with her and stay at Uppercross , whenever she returned .
austen#"Captain Wentworth was gone , for the present , to see his brother in Shropshire . "" I hope I shall remember , in future ,"" said Lady Russell , as soon as they were reseated in the carriage , "" not to call at Uppercross in the Christmas holidays ."" Everybody has their taste in noises as well as in other matters ; and sounds are quite innoxious , or most distressing , by their sort rather than their quantity . When Lady Russell not long afterwards , was entering Bath on a wet afternoon , and driving through the long course of streets from the Old Bridge to Camden Place , amidst the dash of other carriages , the heavy rumble of carts and drays , the bawling of newspapermen , muffin - men and milkmen , and the ceaseless clink of pattens , she made no complaint . No , these were noises which belonged to the winter pleasures ; her spirits rose under their influence ; and like Mrs Musgrove , she was feeling , though not saying , that after being long in the country , nothing could be so good for her as a little quiet cheerfulness . Anne did not share these feelings ."
austen#She persisted in a very determined , though very silent disinclination for Bath ; caught the first dim view of the extensive buildings , smoking in rain , without any wish of seeing them better ; felt their progress through the streets to be , however disagreeable , yet too rapid ; for who would be glad to see her when she arrived ? And looked back , with fond regret , to the bustles of Uppercross and the seclusion of Kellynch . Elizabeth ' s last letter had communicated a piece of news of some interest . Mr Elliot was in Bath . He had called in Camden Place ; had called a second time , a third ; had been pointedly attentive . If Elizabeth and her father did not deceive themselves , had been taking much pains to seek the acquaintance , and proclaim the value of the connection , as he had formerly taken pains to shew neglect .
austen#"This was very wonderful if it were true ; and Lady Russell was in a state of very agreeable curiosity and perplexity about Mr Elliot , already recanting the sentiment she had so lately expressed to Mary , of his being "" a man whom she had no wish to see ."" She had a great wish to see him . If he really sought to reconcile himself like a dutiful branch , he must be forgiven for having dismembered himself from the paternal tree . Anne was not animated to an equal pitch by the circumstance , but she felt that she would rather see Mr Elliot again than not , which was more than she could say for many other persons in Bath . She was put down in Camden Place ; and Lady Russell then drove to her own lodgings , in Rivers Street . Chapter 15"
austen#"Sir Walter had taken a very good house in Camden Place , a lofty dignified situation , such as becomes a man of consequence ; and both he and Elizabeth were settled there , much to their satisfaction . Anne entered it with a sinking heart , anticipating an imprisonment of many months , and anxiously saying to herself , "" Oh ! when shall I leave you again ?"" A degree of unexpected cordiality , however , in the welcome she received , did her good . Her father and sister were glad to see her , for the sake of shewing her the house and furniture , and met her with kindness . Her making a fourth , when they sat down to dinner , was noticed as an advantage ."
austen#Mrs Clay was very pleasant , and very smiling , but her courtesies and smiles were more a matter of course . Anne had always felt that she would pretend what was proper on her arrival , but the complaisance of the others was unlooked for . They were evidently in excellent spirits , and she was soon to listen to the causes . They had no inclination to listen to her . After laying out for some compliments of being deeply regretted in their old neighbourhood , which Anne could not pay , they had only a few faint enquiries to make , before the talk must be all their own . Uppercross excited no interest , Kellynch very little : it was all Bath .
austen#They had the pleasure of assuring her that Bath more than answered their expectations in every respect . Their house was undoubtedly the best in Camden Place ; their drawing - rooms had many decided advantages over all the others which they had either seen or heard of , and the superiority was not less in the style of the fitting - up , or the taste of the furniture . Their acquaintance was exceedingly sought after . Everybody was wanting to visit them . They had drawn back from many introductions , and still were perpetually having cards left by people of whom they knew nothing . Here were funds of enjoyment .
austen#Could Anne wonder that her father and sister were happy ? She might not wonder , but she must sigh that her father should feel no degradation in his change , should see nothing to regret in the duties and dignity of the resident landholder , should find so much to be vain of in the littlenesses of a town ; and she must sigh , and smile , and wonder too , as Elizabeth threw open the folding - doors and walked with exultation from one drawing - room to the other , boasting of their space ; at the possibility of that woman , who had been mistress of Kellynch Hall , finding extent to be proud of between two walls , perhaps thirty feet asunder . But this was not all which they had to make them happy . They had Mr Elliot too . Anne had a great deal to hear of Mr Elliot . He was not only pardoned , they were delighted with him .
austen#He had been in Bath about a fortnight ; ( he had passed through Bath in November , in his way to London , when the intelligence of Sir Walter ' s being settled there had of course reached him , though only twenty - four hours in the place , but he had not been able to avail himself of it ;) but he had now been a fortnight in Bath , and his first object on arriving , had been to leave his card in Camden Place , following it up by such assiduous endeavours to meet , and when they did meet , by such great openness of conduct , such readiness to apologize for the past , such solicitude to be received as a relation again , that their former good understanding was completely re - established . They had not a fault to find in him . He had explained away all the appearance of neglect on his own side . It had originated in misapprehension entirely . He had never had an idea of throwing himself off ; he had feared that he was thrown off , but knew not why , and delicacy had kept him silent . Upon the hint of having spoken disrespectfully or carelessly of the family and the family honours , he was quite indignant .
austen#He , who had ever boasted of being an Elliot , and whose feelings , as to connection , were only too strict to suit the unfeudal tone of the present day . He was astonished , indeed , but his character and general conduct must refute it . He could refer Sir Walter to all who knew him ; and certainly , the pains he had been taking on this , the first opportunity of reconciliation , to be restored to the footing of a relation and heir - presumptive , was a strong proof of his opinions on the subject . The circumstances of his marriage , too , were found to admit of much extenuation . This was an article not to be entered on by himself ; but a very intimate friend of his , a Colonel Wallis , a highly respectable man , perfectly the gentleman , ( and not an ill - looking man , Sir Walter added ), who was living in very good style in Marlborough Buildings , and had , at his own particular request , been admitted to their acquaintance through Mr Elliot , had mentioned one or two things relative to the marriage , which made a material difference in the discredit of it . Colonel Wallis had known Mr Elliot long , had been well acquainted also with his wife , had perfectly understood the whole story .
austen#She was certainly not a woman of family , but well educated , accomplished , rich , and excessively in love with his friend . There had been the charm . She had sought him . Without that attraction , not all her money would have tempted Elliot , and Sir Walter was , moreover , assured of her having been a very fine woman . Here was a great deal to soften the business . A very fine woman with a large fortune , in love with him !
austen#Sir Walter seemed to admit it as complete apology ; and though Elizabeth could not see the circumstance in quite so favourable a light , she allowed it be a great extenuation . Mr Elliot had called repeatedly , had dined with them once , evidently delighted by the distinction of being asked , for they gave no dinners in general ; delighted , in short , by every proof of cousinly notice , and placing his whole happiness in being on intimate terms in Camden Place . Anne listened , but without quite understanding it . Allowances , large allowances , she knew , must be made for the ideas of those who spoke . She heard it all under embellishment . All that sounded extravagant or irrational in the progress of the reconciliation might have no origin but in the language of the relators .
austen#Still , however , she had the sensation of there being something more than immediately appeared , in Mr Elliot ' s wishing , after an interval of so many years , to be well received by them . In a worldly view , he had nothing to gain by being on terms with Sir Walter ; nothing to risk by a state of variance . In all probability he was already the richer of the two , and the Kellynch estate would as surely be his hereafter as the title . A sensible man , and he had looked like a very sensible man , why should it be an object to him ? She could only offer one solution ; it was , perhaps , for Elizabeth ' s sake . There might really have been a liking formerly , though convenience and accident had drawn him a different way ; and now that he could afford to please himself , he might mean to pay his addresses to her .
austen#"Elizabeth was certainly very handsome , with well - bred , elegant manners , and her character might never have been penetrated by Mr Elliot , knowing her but in public , and when very young himself . How her temper and understanding might bear the investigation of his present keener time of life was another concern and rather a fearful one . Most earnestly did she wish that he might not be too nice , or too observant if Elizabeth were his object ; and that Elizabeth was disposed to believe herself so , and that her friend Mrs Clay was encouraging the idea , seemed apparent by a glance or two between them , while Mr Elliot ' s frequent visits were talked of . Anne mentioned the glimpses she had had of him at Lyme , but without being much attended to . "" Oh ! yes , perhaps , it had been Mr Elliot ."
austen#"They did not know . It might be him , perhaps ."" They could not listen to her description of him . They were describing him themselves ; Sir Walter especially . He did justice to his very gentlemanlike appearance , his air of elegance and fashion , his good shaped face , his sensible eye ; but , at the same time , "" must lament his being very much under - hung , a defect which time seemed to have increased ; nor could he pretend to say that ten years had not altered almost every feature for the worse . Mr Elliot appeared to think that he ( Sir Walter ) was looking exactly as he had done when they last parted ;"" but Sir Walter had "" not been able to return the compliment entirely , which had embarrassed him ."
austen#"He did not mean to complain , however . Mr Elliot was better to look at than most men , and he had no objection to being seen with him anywhere ."" Mr Elliot , and his friends in Marlborough Buildings , were talked of the whole evening . "" Colonel Wallis had been so impatient to be introduced to them ! and Mr Elliot so anxious that he should !"" and there was a Mrs Wallis , at present known only to them by description , as she was in daily expectation of her confinement ; but Mr Elliot spoke of her as "" a most charming woman , quite worthy of being known in Camden Place ,"" and as soon as she recovered they were to be acquainted ."
austen#"Sir Walter thought much of Mrs Wallis ; she was said to be an excessively pretty woman , beautiful . "" He longed to see her . He hoped she might make some amends for the many very plain faces he was continually passing in the streets . The worst of Bath was the number of its plain women . He did not mean to say that there were no pretty women , but the number of the plain was out of all proportion . He had frequently observed , as he walked , that one handsome face would be followed by thirty , or five - and - thirty frights ; and once , as he had stood in a shop on Bond Street , he had counted eighty - seven women go by , one after another , without there being a tolerable face among them ."
austen#"It had been a frosty morning , to be sure , a sharp frost , which hardly one woman in a thousand could stand the test of . But still , there certainly were a dreadful multitude of ugly women in Bath ; and as for the men ! they were infinitely worse . Such scarecrows as the streets were full of ! It was evident how little the women were used to the sight of anything tolerable , by the effect which a man of decent appearance produced . He had never walked anywhere arm - in - arm with Colonel Wallis ( who was a fine military figure , though sandy - haired ) without observing that every woman ' s eye was upon him ; every woman ' s eye was sure to be upon Colonel Wallis ."""
austen#"Modest Sir Walter ! He was not allowed to escape , however . His daughter and Mrs Clay united in hinting that Colonel Wallis ' s companion might have as good a figure as Colonel Wallis , and certainly was not sandy - haired . "" How is Mary looking ?"" said Sir Walter , in the height of his good humour . "" The last time I saw her she had a red nose , but I hope that may not happen every day ."""
austen#""" Oh ! no , that must have been quite accidental . In general she has been in very good health and very good looks since Michaelmas ."" "" If I thought it would not tempt her to go out in sharp winds , and grow coarse , I would send her a new hat and pelisse ."" Anne was considering whether she should venture to suggest that a gown , or a cap , would not be liable to any such misuse , when a knock at the door suspended everything . "" A knock at the door !"
austen#and so late ! It was ten o ' clock . Could it be Mr Elliot ? They knew he was to dine in Lansdown Crescent . It was possible that he might stop in his way home to ask them how they did . They could think of no one else .
austen#"Mrs Clay decidedly thought it Mr Elliot ' s knock ."" Mrs Clay was right . With all the state which a butler and foot - boy could give , Mr Elliot was ushered into the room . It was the same , the very same man , with no difference but of dress . Anne drew a little back , while the others received his compliments , and her sister his apologies for calling at so unusual an hour , but "" he could not be so near without wishing to know that neither she nor her friend had taken cold the day before ,"" & c . & c ; which was all as politely done , and as politely taken , as possible , but her part must follow then . Sir Walter talked of his youngest daughter ; "" Mr Elliot must give him leave to present him to his youngest daughter "" ( there was no occasion for remembering Mary ); and Anne , smiling and blushing , very becomingly shewed to Mr Elliot the pretty features which he had by no means forgotten , and instantly saw , with amusement at his little start of surprise , that he had not been at all aware of who she was ."
austen#He looked completely astonished , but not more astonished than pleased ; his eyes brightened ! and with the most perfect alacrity he welcomed the relationship , alluded to the past , and entreated to be received as an acquaintance already . He was quite as good - looking as he had appeared at Lyme , his countenance improved by speaking , and his manners were so exactly what they ought to be , so polished , so easy , so particularly agreeable , that she could compare them in excellence to only one person ' s manners . They were not the same , but they were , perhaps , equally good . He sat down with them , and improved their conversation very much . There could be no doubt of his being a sensible man .
austen#Ten minutes were enough to certify that . His tone , his expressions , his choice of subject , his knowing where to stop ; it was all the operation of a sensible , discerning mind . As soon as he could , he began to talk to her of Lyme , wanting to compare opinions respecting the place , but especially wanting to speak of the circumstance of their happening to be guests in the same inn at the same time ; to give his own route , understand something of hers , and regret that he should have lost such an opportunity of paying his respects to her . She gave him a short account of her party and business at Lyme . His regret increased as he listened . He had spent his whole solitary evening in the room adjoining theirs ; had heard voices , mirth continually ; thought they must be a most delightful set of people , longed to be with them , but certainly without the smallest suspicion of his possessing the shadow of a right to introduce himself .
austen#"If he had but asked who the party were ! The name of Musgrove would have told him enough . "" Well , it would serve to cure him of an absurd practice of never asking a question at an inn , which he had adopted , when quite a young man , on the principal of its being very ungenteel to be curious . "" The notions of a young man of one or two and twenty ,"" said he , "" as to what is necessary in manners to make him quite the thing , are more absurd , I believe , than those of any other set of beings in the world . The folly of the means they often employ is only to be equalled by the folly of what they have in view ."" But he must not be addressing his reflections to Anne alone : he knew it ; he was soon diffused again among the others , and it was only at intervals that he could return to Lyme ."
austen#"His enquiries , however , produced at length an account of the scene she had been engaged in there , soon after his leaving the place . Having alluded to "" an accident ,"" he must hear the whole . When he questioned , Sir Walter and Elizabeth began to question also , but the difference in their manner of doing it could not be unfelt . She could only compare Mr Elliot to Lady Russell , in the wish of really comprehending what had passed , and in the degree of concern for what she must have suffered in witnessing it . He staid an hour with them . The elegant little clock on the mantel - piece had struck "" eleven with its silver sounds ,"" and the watchman was beginning to be heard at a distance telling the same tale , before Mr Elliot or any of them seemed to feel that he had been there long ."
austen#"Anne could not have supposed it possible that her first evening in Camden Place could have passed so well ! Chapter 16 There was one point which Anne , on returning to her family , would have been more thankful to ascertain even than Mr Elliot ' s being in love with Elizabeth , which was , her father ' s not being in love with Mrs Clay ; and she was very far from easy about it , when she had been at home a few hours . On going down to breakfast the next morning , she found there had just been a decent pretence on the lady ' s side of meaning to leave them . She could imagine Mrs Clay to have said , that "" now Miss Anne was come , she could not suppose herself at all wanted ;"" for Elizabeth was replying in a sort of whisper , "" That must not be any reason , indeed . I assure you I feel it none ."
austen#"She is nothing to me , compared with you ;"" and she was in full time to hear her father say , "" My dear madam , this must not be . As yet , you have seen nothing of Bath . You have been here only to be useful . You must not run away from us now . You must stay to be acquainted with Mrs Wallis , the beautiful Mrs Wallis . To your fine mind , I well know the sight of beauty is a real gratification ."""
austen#"He spoke and looked so much in earnest , that Anne was not surprised to see Mrs Clay stealing a glance at Elizabeth and herself . Her countenance , perhaps , might express some watchfulness ; but the praise of the fine mind did not appear to excite a thought in her sister . The lady could not but yield to such joint entreaties , and promise to stay . In the course of the same morning , Anne and her father chancing to be alone together , he began to compliment her on her improved looks ; he thought her "" less thin in her person , in her cheeks ; her skin , her complexion , greatly improved ; clearer , fresher . Had she been using any thing in particular ?"" "" No , nothing ."""
austen#""" Merely Gowland ,"" he supposed . "" No , nothing at all ."" "" Ha ! he was surprised at that ;"" and added , "" certainly you cannot do better than to continue as you are ; you cannot be better than well ; or I should recommend Gowland , the constant use of Gowland , during the spring months . Mrs Clay has been using it at my recommendation , and you see what it has done for her . You see how it has carried away her freckles ."""
austen#If Elizabeth could but have heard this ! Such personal praise might have struck her , especially as it did not appear to Anne that the freckles were at all lessened . But everything must take its chance . The evil of a marriage would be much diminished , if Elizabeth were also to marry . As for herself , she might always command a home with Lady Russell . Lady Russell ' s composed mind and polite manners were put to some trial on this point , in her intercourse in Camden Place .
austen#"The sight of Mrs Clay in such favour , and of Anne so overlooked , was a perpetual provocation to her there ; and vexed her as much when she was away , as a person in Bath who drinks the water , gets all the new publications , and has a very large acquaintance , has time to be vexed . As Mr Elliot became known to her , she grew more charitable , or more indifferent , towards the others . His manners were an immediate recommendation ; and on conversing with him she found the solid so fully supporting the superficial , that she was at first , as she told Anne , almost ready to exclaim , "" Can this be Mr Elliot ?"" and could not seriously picture to herself a more agreeable or estimable man . Everything united in him ; good understanding , correct opinions , knowledge of the world , and a warm heart . He had strong feelings of family attachment and family honour , without pride or weakness ; he lived with the liberality of a man of fortune , without display ; he judged for himself in everything essential , without defying public opinion in any point of worldly decorum ."
austen#He was steady , observant , moderate , candid ; never run away with by spirits or by selfishness , which fancied itself strong feeling ; and yet , with a sensibility to what was amiable and lovely , and a value for all the felicities of domestic life , which characters of fancied enthusiasm and violent agitation seldom really possess . She was sure that he had not been happy in marriage . Colonel Wallis said it , and Lady Russell saw it ; but it had been no unhappiness to sour his mind , nor ( she began pretty soon to suspect ) to prevent his thinking of a second choice . Her satisfaction in Mr Elliot outweighed all the plague of Mrs Clay . It was now some years since Anne had begun to learn that she and her excellent friend could sometimes think differently ; and it did not surprise her , therefore , that Lady Russell should see nothing suspicious or inconsistent , nothing to require more motives than appeared , in Mr Elliot ' s great desire of a reconciliation . In Lady Russell ' s view , it was perfectly natural that Mr Elliot , at a mature time of life , should feel it a most desirable object , and what would very generally recommend him among all sensible people , to be on good terms with the head of his family ; the simplest process in the world of time upon a head naturally clear , and only erring in the heyday of youth .
austen#"Anne presumed , however , still to smile about it , and at last to mention "" Elizabeth ."" Lady Russell listened , and looked , and made only this cautious reply :--"" Elizabeth ! very well ; time will explain ."" It was a reference to the future , which Anne , after a little observation , felt she must submit to . She could determine nothing at present . In that house Elizabeth must be first ; and she was in the habit of such general observance as "" Miss Elliot ,"" that any particularity of attention seemed almost impossible ."
austen#Mr Elliot , too , it must be remembered , had not been a widower seven months . A little delay on his side might be very excusable . In fact , Anne could never see the crape round his hat , without fearing that she was the inexcusable one , in attributing to him such imaginations ; for though his marriage had not been very happy , still it had existed so many years that she could not comprehend a very rapid recovery from the awful impression of its being dissolved . However it might end , he was without any question their pleasantest acquaintance in Bath : she saw nobody equal to him ; and it was a great indulgence now and then to talk to him about Lyme , which he seemed to have as lively a wish to see again , and to see more of , as herself . They went through the particulars of their first meeting a great many times . He gave her to understand that he had looked at her with some earnestness .
austen#She knew it well ; and she remembered another person ' s look also . They did not always think alike . His value for rank and connexion she perceived was greater than hers . It was not merely complaisance , it must be a liking to the cause , which made him enter warmly into her father and sister ' s solicitudes on a subject which she thought unworthy to excite them . The Bath paper one morning announced the arrival of the Dowager Viscountess Dalrymple , and her daughter , the Honourable Miss Carteret ; and all the comfort of No .--, Camden Place , was swept away for many days ; for the Dalrymples ( in Anne ' s opinion , most unfortunately ) were cousins of the Elliots ; and the agony was how to introduce themselves properly . Anne had never seen her father and sister before in contact with nobility , and she must acknowledge herself disappointed .
austen#"She had hoped better things from their high ideas of their own situation in life , and was reduced to form a wish which she had never foreseen ; a wish that they had more pride ; for "" our cousins Lady Dalrymple and Miss Carteret ;"" "" our cousins , the Dalrymples ,"" sounded in her ears all day long . Sir Walter had once been in company with the late viscount , but had never seen any of the rest of the family ; and the difficulties of the case arose from there having been a suspension of all intercourse by letters of ceremony , ever since the death of that said late viscount , when , in consequence of a dangerous illness of Sir Walter ' s at the same time , there had been an unlucky omission at Kellynch . No letter of condolence had been sent to Ireland . The neglect had been visited on the head of the sinner ; for when poor Lady Elliot died herself , no letter of condolence was received at Kellynch , and , consequently , there was but too much reason to apprehend that the Dalrymples considered the relationship as closed . How to have this anxious business set to rights , and be admitted as cousins again , was the question : and it was a question which , in a more rational manner , neither Lady Russell nor Mr Elliot thought unimportant . "" Family connexions were always worth preserving , good company always worth seeking ; Lady Dalrymple had taken a house , for three months , in Laura Place , and would be living in style ."
austen#"She had been at Bath the year before , and Lady Russell had heard her spoken of as a charming woman . It was very desirable that the connexion should be renewed , if it could be done , without any compromise of propriety on the side of the Elliots ."" Sir Walter , however , would choose his own means , and at last wrote a very fine letter of ample explanation , regret , and entreaty , to his right honourable cousin . Neither Lady Russell nor Mr Elliot could admire the letter ; but it did all that was wanted , in bringing three lines of scrawl from the Dowager Viscountess . "" She was very much honoured , and should be happy in their acquaintance ."" The toils of the business were over , the sweets began ."
austen#"They visited in Laura Place , they had the cards of Dowager Viscountess Dalrymple , and the Honourable Miss Carteret , to be arranged wherever they might be most visible : and "" Our cousins in Laura Place ,""--"" Our cousin , Lady Dalrymple and Miss Carteret ,"" were talked of to everybody . Anne was ashamed . Had Lady Dalrymple and her daughter even been very agreeable , she would still have been ashamed of the agitation they created , but they were nothing . There was no superiority of manner , accomplishment , or understanding . Lady Dalrymple had acquired the name of "" a charming woman ,"" because she had a smile and a civil answer for everybody . Miss Carteret , with still less to say , was so plain and so awkward , that she would never have been tolerated in Camden Place but for her birth ."
austen#"Lady Russell confessed she had expected something better ; but yet "" it was an acquaintance worth having ;"" and when Anne ventured to speak her opinion of them to Mr Elliot , he agreed to their being nothing in themselves , but still maintained that , as a family connexion , as good company , as those who would collect good company around them , they had their value . Anne smiled and said , "" My idea of good company , Mr Elliot , is the company of clever , well - informed people , who have a great deal of conversation ; that is what I call good company ."" "" You are mistaken ,"" said he gently , "" that is not good company ; that is the best . Good company requires only birth , education , and manners , and with regard to education is not very nice . Birth and good manners are essential ; but a little learning is by no means a dangerous thing in good company ; on the contrary , it will do very well ."
austen#"My cousin Anne shakes her head . She is not satisfied . She is fastidious . My dear cousin "" ( sitting down by her ), "" you have a better right to be fastidious than almost any other woman I know ; but will it answer ? Will it make you happy ? Will it not be wiser to accept the society of those good ladies in Laura Place , and enjoy all the advantages of the connexion as far as possible ?"
austen#"You may depend upon it , that they will move in the first set in Bath this winter , and as rank is rank , your being known to be related to them will have its use in fixing your family ( our family let me say ) in that degree of consideration which we must all wish for ."" "" Yes ,"" sighed Anne , "" we shall , indeed , be known to be related to them !"" then recollecting herself , and not wishing to be answered , she added , "" I certainly do think there has been by far too much trouble taken to procure the acquaintance . I suppose "" ( smiling ) "" I have more pride than any of you ; but I confess it does vex me , that we should be so solicitous to have the relationship acknowledged , which we may be very sure is a matter of perfect indifference to them ."" "" Pardon me , dear cousin , you are unjust in your own claims . In London , perhaps , in your present quiet style of living , it might be as you say : but in Bath ; Sir Walter Elliot and his family will always be worth knowing : always acceptable as acquaintance ."""
austen#""" Well ,"" said Anne , "" I certainly am proud , too proud to enjoy a welcome which depends so entirely upon place ."" "" I love your indignation ,"" said he ; "" it is very natural . But here you are in Bath , and the object is to be established here with all the credit and dignity which ought to belong to Sir Walter Elliot . You talk of being proud ; I am called proud , I know , and I shall not wish to believe myself otherwise ; for our pride , if investigated , would have the same object , I have no doubt , though the kind may seem a little different . In one point , I am sure , my dear cousin ,"" ( he continued , speaking lower , though there was no one else in the room ) "" in one point , I am sure , we must feel alike . We must feel that every addition to your father ' s society , among his equals or superiors , may be of use in diverting his thoughts from those who are beneath him ."""
austen#He looked , as he spoke , to the seat which Mrs Clay had been lately occupying : a sufficient explanation of what he particularly meant ; and though Anne could not believe in their having the same sort of pride , she was pleased with him for not liking Mrs Clay ; and her conscience admitted that his wishing to promote her father ' s getting great acquaintance was more than excusable in the view of defeating her . Chapter 17 While Sir Walter and Elizabeth were assiduously pushing their good fortune in Laura Place , Anne was renewing an acquaintance of a very different description . She had called on her former governess , and had heard from her of there being an old school - fellow in Bath , who had the two strong claims on her attention of past kindness and present suffering . Miss Hamilton , now Mrs Smith , had shewn her kindness in one of those periods of her life when it had been most valuable . Anne had gone unhappy to school , grieving for the loss of a mother whom she had dearly loved , feeling her separation from home , and suffering as a girl of fourteen , of strong sensibility and not high spirits , must suffer at such a time ; and Miss Hamilton , three years older than herself , but still from the want of near relations and a settled home , remaining another year at school , had been useful and good to her in a way which had considerably lessened her misery , and could never be remembered with indifference .
austen#Miss Hamilton had left school , had married not long afterwards , was said to have married a man of fortune , and this was all that Anne had known of her , till now that their governess ' s account brought her situation forward in a more decided but very different form . She was a widow and poor . Her husband had been extravagant ; and at his death , about two years before , had left his affairs dreadfully involved . She had had difficulties of every sort to contend with , and in addition to these distresses had been afflicted with a severe rheumatic fever , which , finally settling in her legs , had made her for the present a cripple . She had come to Bath on that account , and was now in lodgings near the hot baths , living in a very humble way , unable even to afford herself the comfort of a servant , and of course almost excluded from society . Their mutual friend answered for the satisfaction which a visit from Miss Elliot would give Mrs Smith , and Anne therefore lost no time in going .
austen#She mentioned nothing of what she had heard , or what she intended , at home . It would excite no proper interest there . She only consulted Lady Russell , who entered thoroughly into her sentiments , and was most happy to convey her as near to Mrs Smith ' s lodgings in Westgate Buildings , as Anne chose to be taken . The visit was paid , their acquaintance re - established , their interest in each other more than re - kindled . The first ten minutes had its awkwardness and its emotion . Twelve years were gone since they had parted , and each presented a somewhat different person from what the other had imagined .
austen#Twelve years had changed Anne from the blooming , silent , unformed girl of fifteen , to the elegant little woman of seven - and - twenty , with every beauty except bloom , and with manners as consciously right as they were invariably gentle ; and twelve years had transformed the fine - looking , well - grown Miss Hamilton , in all the glow of health and confidence of superiority , into a poor , infirm , helpless widow , receiving the visit of her former protegee as a favour ; but all that was uncomfortable in the meeting had soon passed away , and left only the interesting charm of remembering former partialities and talking over old times . Anne found in Mrs Smith the good sense and agreeable manners which she had almost ventured to depend on , and a disposition to converse and be cheerful beyond her expectation . Neither the dissipations of the past -- and she had lived very much in the world -- nor the restrictions of the present , neither sickness nor sorrow seemed to have closed her heart or ruined her spirits . In the course of a second visit she talked with great openness , and Anne ' s astonishment increased . She could scarcely imagine a more cheerless situation in itself than Mrs Smith ' s . She had been very fond of her husband : she had buried him .
austen#She had been used to affluence : it was gone . She had no child to connect her with life and happiness again , no relations to assist in the arrangement of perplexed affairs , no health to make all the rest supportable . Her accommodations were limited to a noisy parlour , and a dark bedroom behind , with no possibility of moving from one to the other without assistance , which there was only one servant in the house to afford , and she never quitted the house but to be conveyed into the warm bath . Yet , in spite of all this , Anne had reason to believe that she had moments only of languor and depression , to hours of occupation and enjoyment . How could it be ? She watched , observed , reflected , and finally determined that this was not a case of fortitude or of resignation only .
austen#A submissive spirit might be patient , a strong understanding would supply resolution , but here was something more ; here was that elasticity of mind , that disposition to be comforted , that power of turning readily from evil to good , and of finding employment which carried her out of herself , which was from nature alone . It was the choicest gift of Heaven ; and Anne viewed her friend as one of those instances in which , by a merciful appointment , it seems designed to counterbalance almost every other want . There had been a time , Mrs Smith told her , when her spirits had nearly failed . She could not call herself an invalid now , compared with her state on first reaching Bath . Then she had , indeed , been a pitiable object ; for she had caught cold on the journey , and had hardly taken possession of her lodgings before she was again confined to her bed and suffering under severe and constant pain ; and all this among strangers , with the absolute necessity of having a regular nurse , and finances at that moment particularly unfit to meet any extraordinary expense . She had weathered it , however , and could truly say that it had done her good .
austen#"It had increased her comforts by making her feel herself to be in good hands . She had seen too much of the world , to expect sudden or disinterested attachment anywhere , but her illness had proved to her that her landlady had a character to preserve , and would not use her ill ; and she had been particularly fortunate in her nurse , as a sister of her landlady , a nurse by profession , and who had always a home in that house when unemployed , chanced to be at liberty just in time to attend her . "" And she ,"" said Mrs Smith , "" besides nursing me most admirably , has really proved an invaluable acquaintance . As soon as I could use my hands she taught me to knit , which has been a great amusement ; and she put me in the way of making these little thread - cases , pin - cushions and card - racks , which you always find me so busy about , and which supply me with the means of doing a little good to one or two very poor families in this neighbourhood . She had a large acquaintance , of course professionally , among those who can afford to buy , and she disposes of my merchandise . She always takes the right time for applying ."
austen#"Everybody ' s heart is open , you know , when they have recently escaped from severe pain , or are recovering the blessing of health , and Nurse Rooke thoroughly understands when to speak . She is a shrewd , intelligent , sensible woman . Hers is a line for seeing human nature ; and she has a fund of good sense and observation , which , as a companion , make her infinitely superior to thousands of those who having only received ` the best education in the world ,' know nothing worth attending to . Call it gossip , if you will , but when Nurse Rooke has half an hour ' s leisure to bestow on me , she is sure to have something to relate that is entertaining and profitable : something that makes one know one ' s species better . One likes to hear what is going on , to be au fait as to the newest modes of being trifling and silly . To me , who live so much alone , her conversation , I assure you , is a treat ."""
austen#"Anne , far from wishing to cavil at the pleasure , replied , "" I can easily believe it . Women of that class have great opportunities , and if they are intelligent may be well worth listening to . Such varieties of human nature as they are in the habit of witnessing ! And it is not merely in its follies , that they are well read ; for they see it occasionally under every circumstance that can be most interesting or affecting . What instances must pass before them of ardent , disinterested , self - denying attachment , of heroism , fortitude , patience , resignation : of all the conflicts and all the sacrifices that ennoble us most . A sick chamber may often furnish the worth of volumes ."""
austen#""" Yes ,"" said Mrs Smith more doubtingly , "" sometimes it may , though I fear its lessons are not often in the elevated style you describe . Here and there , human nature may be great in times of trial ; but generally speaking , it is its weakness and not its strength that appears in a sick chamber : it is selfishness and impatience rather than generosity and fortitude , that one hears of . There is so little real friendship in the world ! and unfortunately "" ( speaking low and tremulously ) "" there are so many who forget to think seriously till it is almost too late ."" Anne saw the misery of such feelings . The husband had not been what he ought , and the wife had been led among that part of mankind which made her think worse of the world than she hoped it deserved ."
austen#"It was but a passing emotion however with Mrs Smith ; she shook it off , and soon added in a different tone -- "" I do not suppose the situation my friend Mrs Rooke is in at present , will furnish much either to interest or edify me . She is only nursing Mrs Wallis of Marlborough Buildings ; a mere pretty , silly , expensive , fashionable woman , I believe ; and of course will have nothing to report but of lace and finery . I mean to make my profit of Mrs Wallis , however . She has plenty of money , and I intend she shall buy all the high - priced things I have in hand now ."" Anne had called several times on her friend , before the existence of such a person was known in Camden Place ."
austen#"At last , it became necessary to speak of her . Sir Walter , Elizabeth and Mrs Clay , returned one morning from Laura Place , with a sudden invitation from Lady Dalrymple for the same evening , and Anne was already engaged , to spend that evening in Westgate Buildings . She was not sorry for the excuse . They were only asked , she was sure , because Lady Dalrymple being kept at home by a bad cold , was glad to make use of the relationship which had been so pressed on her ; and she declined on her own account with great alacrity --"" She was engaged to spend the evening with an old schoolfellow ."" They were not much interested in anything relative to Anne ; but still there were questions enough asked , to make it understood what this old schoolfellow was ; and Elizabeth was disdainful , and Sir Walter severe . "" Westgate Buildings !"""
austen#"said he , "" and who is Miss Anne Elliot to be visiting in Westgate Buildings ? A Mrs Smith . A widow Mrs Smith ; and who was her husband ? One of five thousand Mr Smiths whose names are to be met with everywhere . And what is her attraction ? That she is old and sickly ."
austen#"Upon my word , Miss Anne Elliot , you have the most extraordinary taste ! Everything that revolts other people , low company , paltry rooms , foul air , disgusting associations are inviting to you . But surely you may put off this old lady till to - morrow : she is not so near her end , I presume , but that she may hope to see another day . What is her age ? Forty ?"" "" No , sir , she is not one - and - thirty ; but I do not think I can put off my engagement , because it is the only evening for some time which will at once suit her and myself ."
austen#"She goes into the warm bath to - morrow , and for the rest of the week , you know , we are engaged ."" "" But what does Lady Russell think of this acquaintance ?"" asked Elizabeth . "" She sees nothing to blame in it ,"" replied Anne ; "" on the contrary , she approves it , and has generally taken me when I have called on Mrs Smith . "" Westgate Buildings must have been rather surprised by the appearance of a carriage drawn up near its pavement ,"" observed Sir Walter . "" Sir Henry Russell ' s widow , indeed , has no honours to distinguish her arms , but still it is a handsome equipage , and no doubt is well known to convey a Miss Elliot ."
austen#"A widow Mrs Smith lodging in Westgate Buildings ! A poor widow barely able to live , between thirty and forty ; a mere Mrs Smith , an every - day Mrs Smith , of all people and all names in the world , to be the chosen friend of Miss Anne Elliot , and to be preferred by her to her own family connections among the nobility of England and Ireland ! Mrs Smith ! Such a name !"" Mrs Clay , who had been present while all this passed , now thought it advisable to leave the room , and Anne could have said much , and did long to say a little in defence of her friend ' s not very dissimilar claims to theirs , but her sense of personal respect to her father prevented her . She made no reply ."
austen#She left it to himself to recollect , that Mrs Smith was not the only widow in Bath between thirty and forty , with little to live on , and no surname of dignity . Anne kept her appointment ; the others kept theirs , and of course she heard the next morning that they had had a delightful evening . She had been the only one of the set absent , for Sir Walter and Elizabeth had not only been quite at her ladyship ' s service themselves , but had actually been happy to be employed by her in collecting others , and had been at the trouble of inviting both Lady Russell and Mr Elliot ; and Mr Elliot had made a point of leaving Colonel Wallis early , and Lady Russell had fresh arranged all her evening engagements in order to wait on her . Anne had the whole history of all that such an evening could supply from Lady Russell . To her , its greatest interest must be , in having been very much talked of between her friend and Mr Elliot ; in having been wished for , regretted , and at the same time honoured for staying away in such a cause . Her kind , compassionate visits to this old schoolfellow , sick and reduced , seemed to have quite delighted Mr Elliot .
austen#He thought her a most extraordinary young woman ; in her temper , manners , mind , a model of female excellence . He could meet even Lady Russell in a discussion of her merits ; and Anne could not be given to understand so much by her friend , could not know herself to be so highly rated by a sensible man , without many of those agreeable sensations which her friend meant to create . Lady Russell was now perfectly decided in her opinion of Mr Elliot . She was as much convinced of his meaning to gain Anne in time as of his deserving her , and was beginning to calculate the number of weeks which would free him from all the remaining restraints of widowhood , and leave him at liberty to exert his most open powers of pleasing . She would not speak to Anne with half the certainty she felt on the subject , she would venture on little more than hints of what might be hereafter , of a possible attachment on his side , of the desirableness of the alliance , supposing such attachment to be real and returned . Anne heard her , and made no violent exclamations ; she only smiled , blushed , and gently shook her head .
austen#""" I am no match - maker , as you well know ,"" said Lady Russell , "" being much too well aware of the uncertainty of all human events and calculations . I only mean that if Mr Elliot should some time hence pay his addresses to you , and if you should be disposed to accept him , I think there would be every possibility of your being happy together . A most suitable connection everybody must consider it , but I think it might be a very happy one ."" "" Mr Elliot is an exceedingly agreeable man , and in many respects I think highly of him ,"" said Anne ; "" but we should not suit ."" Lady Russell let this pass , and only said in rejoinder , "" I own that to be able to regard you as the future mistress of Kellynch , the future Lady Elliot , to look forward and see you occupying your dear mother ' s place , succeeding to all her rights , and all her popularity , as well as to all her virtues , would be the highest possible gratification to me . You are your mother ' s self in countenance and disposition ; and if I might be allowed to fancy you such as she was , in situation and name , and home , presiding and blessing in the same spot , and only superior to her in being more highly valued !"
austen#"My dearest Anne , it would give me more delight than is often felt at my time of life !"" Anne was obliged to turn away , to rise , to walk to a distant table , and , leaning there in pretended employment , try to subdue the feelings this picture excited . For a few moments her imagination and her heart were bewitched . The idea of becoming what her mother had been ; of having the precious name of "" Lady Elliot "" first revived in herself ; of being restored to Kellynch , calling it her home again , her home for ever , was a charm which she could not immediately resist . Lady Russell said not another word , willing to leave the matter to its own operation ; and believing that , could Mr Elliot at that moment with propriety have spoken for himself !-- she believed , in short , what Anne did not believe . The same image of Mr Elliot speaking for himself brought Anne to composure again ."
austen#"The charm of Kellynch and of "" Lady Elliot "" all faded away . She never could accept him . And it was not only that her feelings were still adverse to any man save one ; her judgement , on a serious consideration of the possibilities of such a case was against Mr Elliot . Though they had now been acquainted a month , she could not be satisfied that she really knew his character . That he was a sensible man , an agreeable man , that he talked well , professed good opinions , seemed to judge properly and as a man of principle , this was all clear enough . He certainly knew what was right , nor could she fix on any one article of moral duty evidently transgressed ; but yet she would have been afraid to answer for his conduct ."
austen#She distrusted the past , if not the present . The names which occasionally dropt of former associates , the allusions to former practices and pursuits , suggested suspicions not favourable of what he had been . She saw that there had been bad habits ; that Sunday travelling had been a common thing ; that there had been a period of his life ( and probably not a short one ) when he had been , at least , careless in all serious matters ; and , though he might now think very differently , who could answer for the true sentiments of a clever , cautious man , grown old enough to appreciate a fair character ? How could it ever be ascertained that his mind was truly cleansed ? Mr Elliot was rational , discreet , polished , but he was not open . There was never any burst of feeling , any warmth of indignation or delight , at the evil or good of others .
austen#This , to Anne , was a decided imperfection . Her early impressions were incurable . She prized the frank , the open - hearted , the eager character beyond all others . Warmth and enthusiasm did captivate her still . She felt that she could so much more depend upon the sincerity of those who sometimes looked or said a careless or a hasty thing , than of those whose presence of mind never varied , whose tongue never slipped . Mr Elliot was too generally agreeable .
austen#Various as were the tempers in her father ' s house , he pleased them all . He endured too well , stood too well with every body . He had spoken to her with some degree of openness of Mrs Clay ; had appeared completely to see what Mrs Clay was about , and to hold her in contempt ; and yet Mrs Clay found him as agreeable as any body . Lady Russell saw either less or more than her young friend , for she saw nothing to excite distrust . She could not imagine a man more exactly what he ought to be than Mr Elliot ; nor did she ever enjoy a sweeter feeling than the hope of seeing him receive the hand of her beloved Anne in Kellynch church , in the course of the following autumn . Chapter 18
austen#It was the beginning of February ; and Anne , having been a month in Bath , was growing very eager for news from Uppercross and Lyme . She wanted to hear much more than Mary had communicated . It was three weeks since she had heard at all . She only knew that Henrietta was at home again ; and that Louisa , though considered to be recovering fast , was still in Lyme ; and she was thinking of them all very intently one evening , when a thicker letter than usual from Mary was delivered to her ; and , to quicken the pleasure and surprise , with Admiral and Mrs Croft ' s compliments . The Crofts must be in Bath ! A circumstance to interest her .
austen#"They were people whom her heart turned to very naturally . "" What is this ?"" cried Sir Walter . "" The Crofts have arrived in Bath ? The Crofts who rent Kellynch ? What have they brought you ?"""
austen#""" A letter from Uppercross Cottage , Sir ."" "" Oh ! those letters are convenient passports . They secure an introduction . I should have visited Admiral Croft , however , at any rate . I know what is due to my tenant ."""
austen#"Anne could listen no longer ; she could not even have told how the poor Admiral ' s complexion escaped ; her letter engrossed her . It had been begun several days back . "" February 1st . "" My dear Anne ,-- I make no apology for my silence , because I know how little people think of letters in such a place as Bath . You must be a great deal too happy to care for Uppercross , which , as you well know , affords little to write about . We have had a very dull Christmas ; Mr and Mrs Musgrove have not had one dinner party all the holidays ."
austen#I do not reckon the Hayters as anybody . The holidays , however , are over at last : I believe no children ever had such long ones . I am sure I had not . The house was cleared yesterday , except of the little Harvilles ; but you will be surprised to hear they have never gone home . Mrs Harville must be an odd mother to part with them so long . I do not understand it .
austen#They are not at all nice children , in my opinion ; but Mrs Musgrove seems to like them quite as well , if not better , than her grandchildren . What dreadful weather we have had ! It may not be felt in Bath , with your nice pavements ; but in the country it is of some consequence . I have not had a creature call on me since the second week in January , except Charles Hayter , who had been calling much oftener than was welcome . Between ourselves , I think it a great pity Henrietta did not remain at Lyme as long as Louisa ; it would have kept her a little out of his way . The carriage is gone to - day , to bring Louisa and the Harvilles to - morrow .
austen#We are not asked to dine with them , however , till the day after , Mrs Musgrove is so afraid of her being fatigued by the journey , which is not very likely , considering the care that will be taken of her ; and it would be much more convenient to me to dine there to - morrow . I am glad you find Mr Elliot so agreeable , and wish I could be acquainted with him too ; but I have my usual luck : I am always out of the way when any thing desirable is going on ; always the last of my family to be noticed . What an immense time Mrs Clay has been staying with Elizabeth ! Does she never mean to go away ? But perhaps if she were to leave the room vacant , we might not be invited . Let me know what you think of this .
austen#I do not expect my children to be asked , you know . I can leave them at the Great House very well , for a month or six weeks . I have this moment heard that the Crofts are going to Bath almost immediately ; they think the Admiral gouty . Charles heard it quite by chance ; they have not had the civility to give me any notice , or of offering to take anything . I do not think they improve at all as neighbours . We see nothing of them , and this is really an instance of gross inattention .
austen#"Charles joins me in love , and everything proper . Yours affectionately , "" Mary M ---. "" I am sorry to say that I am very far from well ; and Jemima has just told me that the butcher says there is a bad sore - throat very much about . I dare say I shall catch it ; and my sore - throats , you know , are always worse than anybody ' s ."" So ended the first part , which had been afterwards put into an envelope , containing nearly as much more ."
austen#""" I kept my letter open , that I might send you word how Louisa bore her journey , and now I am extremely glad I did , having a great deal to add . In the first place , I had a note from Mrs Croft yesterday , offering to convey anything to you ; a very kind , friendly note indeed , addressed to me , just as it ought ; I shall therefore be able to make my letter as long as I like . The Admiral does not seem very ill , and I sincerely hope Bath will do him all the good he wants . I shall be truly glad to have them back again . Our neighbourhood cannot spare such a pleasant family . But now for Louisa ."
austen#I have something to communicate that will astonish you not a little . She and the Harvilles came on Tuesday very safely , and in the evening we went to ask her how she did , when we were rather surprised not to find Captain Benwick of the party , for he had been invited as well as the Harvilles ; and what do you think was the reason ? Neither more nor less than his being in love with Louisa , and not choosing to venture to Uppercross till he had had an answer from Mr Musgrove ; for it was all settled between him and her before she came away , and he had written to her father by Captain Harville . True , upon my honour ! Are not you astonished ? I shall be surprised at least if you ever received a hint of it , for I never did .
austen#Mrs Musgrove protests solemnly that she knew nothing of the matter . We are all very well pleased , however , for though it is not equal to her marrying Captain Wentworth , it is infinitely better than Charles Hayter ; and Mr Musgrove has written his consent , and Captain Benwick is expected to - day . Mrs Harville says her husband feels a good deal on his poor sister ' s account ; but , however , Louisa is a great favourite with both . Indeed , Mrs Harville and I quite agree that we love her the better for having nursed her . Charles wonders what Captain Wentworth will say ; but if you remember , I never thought him attached to Louisa ; I never could see anything of it . And this is the end , you see , of Captain Benwick ' s being supposed to be an admirer of yours .
austen#"How Charles could take such a thing into his head was always incomprehensible to me . I hope he will be more agreeable now . Certainly not a great match for Louisa Musgrove , but a million times better than marrying among the Hayters ."" Mary need not have feared her sister ' s being in any degree prepared for the news . She had never in her life been more astonished . Captain Benwick and Louisa Musgrove !"
austen#"It was almost too wonderful for belief , and it was with the greatest effort that she could remain in the room , preserve an air of calmness , and answer the common questions of the moment . Happily for her , they were not many . Sir Walter wanted to know whether the Crofts travelled with four horses , and whether they were likely to be situated in such a part of Bath as it might suit Miss Elliot and himself to visit in ; but had little curiosity beyond . "" How is Mary ?"" said Elizabeth ; and without waiting for an answer , "" And pray what brings the Crofts to Bath ?"" "" They come on the Admiral ' s account ."
austen#"He is thought to be gouty ."" "" Gout and decrepitude !"" said Sir Walter . "" Poor old gentleman ."" "" Have they any acquaintance here ?"" asked Elizabeth ."
austen#""" I do not know ; but I can hardly suppose that , at Admiral Croft ' s time of life , and in his profession , he should not have many acquaintance in such a place as this ."" "" I suspect ,"" said Sir Walter coolly , "" that Admiral Croft will be best known in Bath as the renter of Kellynch Hall . Elizabeth , may we venture to present him and his wife in Laura Place ?"" "" Oh , no ! I think not . Situated as we are with Lady Dalrymple , cousins , we ought to be very careful not to embarrass her with acquaintance she might not approve ."
austen#"If we were not related , it would not signify ; but as cousins , she would feel scrupulous as to any proposal of ours . We had better leave the Crofts to find their own level . There are several odd - looking men walking about here , who , I am told , are sailors . The Crofts will associate with them ."" This was Sir Walter and Elizabeth ' s share of interest in the letter ; when Mrs Clay had paid her tribute of more decent attention , in an enquiry after Mrs Charles Musgrove , and her fine little boys , Anne was at liberty . In her own room , she tried to comprehend it ."
austen#Well might Charles wonder how Captain Wentworth would feel ! Perhaps he had quitted the field , had given Louisa up , had ceased to love , had found he did not love her . She could not endure the idea of treachery or levity , or anything akin to ill usage between him and his friend . She could not endure that such a friendship as theirs should be severed unfairly . Captain Benwick and Louisa Musgrove ! The high - spirited , joyous - talking Louisa Musgrove , and the dejected , thinking , feeling , reading , Captain Benwick , seemed each of them everything that would not suit the other .
austen#Their minds most dissimilar ! Where could have been the attraction ? The answer soon presented itself . It had been in situation . They had been thrown together several weeks ; they had been living in the same small family party : since Henrietta ' s coming away , they must have been depending almost entirely on each other , and Louisa , just recovering from illness , had been in an interesting state , and Captain Benwick was not inconsolable . That was a point which Anne had not been able to avoid suspecting before ; and instead of drawing the same conclusion as Mary , from the present course of events , they served only to confirm the idea of his having felt some dawning of tenderness toward herself .
austen#She did not mean , however , to derive much more from it to gratify her vanity , than Mary might have allowed . She was persuaded that any tolerably pleasing young woman who had listened and seemed to feel for him would have received the same compliment . He had an affectionate heart . He must love somebody . She saw no reason against their being happy . Louisa had fine naval fervour to begin with , and they would soon grow more alike .
austen#He would gain cheerfulness , and she would learn to be an enthusiast for Scott and Lord Byron ; nay , that was probably learnt already ; of course they had fallen in love over poetry . The idea of Louisa Musgrove turned into a person of literary taste , and sentimental reflection was amusing , but she had no doubt of its being so . The day at Lyme , the fall from the Cobb , might influence her health , her nerves , her courage , her character to the end of her life , as thoroughly as it appeared to have influenced her fate . The conclusion of the whole was , that if the woman who had been sensible of Captain Wentworth ' s merits could be allowed to prefer another man , there was nothing in the engagement to excite lasting wonder ; and if Captain Wentworth lost no friend by it , certainly nothing to be regretted . No , it was not regret which made Anne ' s heart beat in spite of herself , and brought the colour into her cheeks when she thought of Captain Wentworth unshackled and free . She had some feelings which she was ashamed to investigate .
austen#They were too much like joy , senseless joy ! She longed to see the Crofts ; but when the meeting took place , it was evident that no rumour of the news had yet reached them . The visit of ceremony was paid and returned ; and Louisa Musgrove was mentioned , and Captain Benwick , too , without even half a smile . The Crofts had placed themselves in lodgings in Gay Street , perfectly to Sir Walter ' s satisfaction . He was not at all ashamed of the acquaintance , and did , in fact , think and talk a great deal more about the Admiral , than the Admiral ever thought or talked about him . The Crofts knew quite as many people in Bath as they wished for , and considered their intercourse with the Elliots as a mere matter of form , and not in the least likely to afford them any pleasure .
austen#They brought with them their country habit of being almost always together . He was ordered to walk to keep off the gout , and Mrs Croft seemed to go shares with him in everything , and to walk for her life to do him good . Anne saw them wherever she went . Lady Russell took her out in her carriage almost every morning , and she never failed to think of them , and never failed to see them . Knowing their feelings as she did , it was a most attractive picture of happiness to her . She always watched them as long as she could , delighted to fancy she understood what they might be talking of , as they walked along in happy independence , or equally delighted to see the Admiral ' s hearty shake of the hand when he encountered an old friend , and observe their eagerness of conversation when occasionally forming into a little knot of the navy , Mrs Croft looking as intelligent and keen as any of the officers around her .
austen#"Anne was too much engaged with Lady Russell to be often walking herself ; but it so happened that one morning , about a week or ten days after the Croft ' s arrival , it suited her best to leave her friend , or her friend ' s carriage , in the lower part of the town , and return alone to Camden Place , and in walking up Milsom Street she had the good fortune to meet with the Admiral . He was standing by himself at a printshop window , with his hands behind him , in earnest contemplation of some print , and she not only might have passed him unseen , but was obliged to touch as well as address him before she could catch his notice . When he did perceive and acknowledge her , however , it was done with all his usual frankness and good humour . "" Ha ! is it you ? Thank you , thank you ."
austen#This is treating me like a friend . Here I am , you see , staring at a picture . I can never get by this shop without stopping . But what a thing here is , by way of a boat ! Do look at it . Did you ever see the like ?
austen#"What queer fellows your fine painters must be , to think that anybody would venture their lives in such a shapeless old cockleshell as that ? And yet here are two gentlemen stuck up in it mightily at their ease , and looking about them at the rocks and mountains , as if they were not to be upset the next moment , which they certainly must be . I wonder where that boat was built !"" ( laughing heartily ); "" I would not venture over a horsepond in it . Well ,"" ( turning away ), "" now , where are you bound ? Can I go anywhere for you , or with you ?"
austen#"Can I be of any use ?"" "" None , I thank you , unless you will give me the pleasure of your company the little way our road lies together . I am going home ."" "" That I will , with all my heart , and farther , too . Yes , yes we will have a snug walk together , and I have something to tell you as we go along . There , take my arm ; that ' s right ; I do not feel comfortable if I have not a woman there ."
austen#"Lord ! what a boat it is !"" taking a last look at the picture , as they began to be in motion . "" Did you say that you had something to tell me , sir ?"" "" Yes , I have , presently . But here comes a friend , Captain Brigden ; I shall only say , ` How d ' ye do ?'"
austen#as we pass , however . I shall not stop . ` How d ' ye do ?' Brigden stares to see anybody with me but my wife . She , poor soul , is tied by the leg . She has a blister on one of her heels , as large as a three - shilling piece .
austen#If you look across the street , you will see Admiral Brand coming down and his brother . Shabby fellows , both of them ! I am glad they are not on this side of the way . Sophy cannot bear them . They played me a pitiful trick once : got away with some of my best men . I will tell you the whole story another time .
austen#There comes old Sir Archibald Drew and his grandson . Look , he sees us ; he kisses his hand to you ; he takes you for my wife . Ah ! the peace has come too soon for that younker . Poor old Sir Archibald ! How do you like Bath , Miss Elliot ?
austen#"It suits us very well . We are always meeting with some old friend or other ; the streets full of them every morning ; sure to have plenty of chat ; and then we get away from them all , and shut ourselves in our lodgings , and draw in our chairs , and are snug as if we were at Kellynch , ay , or as we used to be even at North Yarmouth and Deal . We do not like our lodgings here the worse , I can tell you , for putting us in mind of those we first had at North Yarmouth . The wind blows through one of the cupboards just in the same way ."" When they were got a little farther , Anne ventured to press again for what he had to communicate . She hoped when clear of Milsom Street to have her curiosity gratified ; but she was still obliged to wait , for the Admiral had made up his mind not to begin till they had gained the greater space and quiet of Belmont ; and as she was not really Mrs Croft , she must let him have his own way ."
austen#"As soon as they were fairly ascending Belmont , he began -- "" Well , now you shall hear something that will surprise you . But first of all , you must tell me the name of the young lady I am going to talk about . That young lady , you know , that we have all been so concerned for . The Miss Musgrove , that all this has been happening to . Her Christian name : I always forget her Christian name ."""
austen#"Anne had been ashamed to appear to comprehend so soon as she really did ; but now she could safely suggest the name of "" Louisa ."" "" Ay , ay , Miss Louisa Musgrove , that is the name . I wish young ladies had not such a number of fine Christian names . I should never be out if they were all Sophys , or something of that sort . Well , this Miss Louisa , we all thought , you know , was to marry Frederick . He was courting her week after week ."
austen#The only wonder was , what they could be waiting for , till the business at Lyme came ; then , indeed , it was clear enough that they must wait till her brain was set to right . But even then there was something odd in their way of going on . Instead of staying at Lyme , he went off to Plymouth , and then he went off to see Edward . When we came back from Minehead he was gone down to Edward ' s , and there he has been ever since . We have seen nothing of him since November . Even Sophy could not understand it .
austen#"But now , the matter has take the strangest turn of all ; for this young lady , the same Miss Musgrove , instead of being to marry Frederick , is to marry James Benwick . You know James Benwick ."" "" A little . I am a little acquainted with Captain Benwick ."" "" Well , she is to marry him . Nay , most likely they are married already , for I do not know what they should wait for ."""
austen#""" I thought Captain Benwick a very pleasing young man ,"" said Anne , "" and I understand that he bears an excellent character ."" "" Oh ! yes , yes , there is not a word to be said against James Benwick . He is only a commander , it is true , made last summer , and these are bad times for getting on , but he has not another fault that I know of . An excellent , good - hearted fellow , I assure you ; a very active , zealous officer too , which is more than you would think for , perhaps , for that soft sort of manner does not do him justice ."" "" Indeed you are mistaken there , sir ; I should never augur want of spirit from Captain Benwick ' s manners ."
austen#"I thought them particularly pleasing , and I will answer for it , they would generally please ."" "" Well , well , ladies are the best judges ; but James Benwick is rather too piano for me ; and though very likely it is all our partiality , Sophy and I cannot help thinking Frederick ' s manners better than his . There is something about Frederick more to our taste ."" Anne was caught . She had only meant to oppose the too common idea of spirit and gentleness being incompatible with each other , not at all to represent Captain Benwick ' s manners as the very best that could possibly be ; and , after a little hesitation , she was beginning to say , "" I was not entering into any comparison of the two friends ,"" but the Admiral interrupted her with -- "" And the thing is certainly true ."
austen#"It is not a mere bit of gossip . We have it from Frederick himself . His sister had a letter from him yesterday , in which he tells us of it , and he had just had it in a letter from Harville , written upon the spot , from Uppercross . I fancy they are all at Uppercross ."" This was an opportunity which Anne could not resist ; she said , therefore , "" I hope , Admiral , I hope there is nothing in the style of Captain Wentworth ' s letter to make you and Mrs Croft particularly uneasy . It did seem , last autumn , as if there were an attachment between him and Louisa Musgrove ; but I hope it may be understood to have worn out on each side equally , and without violence ."
austen#"I hope his letter does not breathe the spirit of an ill - used man ."" "" Not at all , not at all ; there is not an oath or a murmur from beginning to end ."" Anne looked down to hide her smile . "" No , no ; Frederick is not a man to whine and complain ; he has too much spirit for that . If the girl likes another man better , it is very fit she should have him ."" "" Certainly ."
austen#"But what I mean is , that I hope there is nothing in Captain Wentworth ' s manner of writing to make you suppose he thinks himself ill - used by his friend , which might appear , you know , without its being absolutely said . I should be very sorry that such a friendship as has subsisted between him and Captain Benwick should be destroyed , or even wounded , by a circumstance of this sort ."" "" Yes , yes , I understand you . But there is nothing at all of that nature in the letter . He does not give the least fling at Benwick ; does not so much as say , ` I wonder at it , I have a reason of my own for wondering at it .' No , you would not guess , from his way of writing , that he had ever thought of this Miss ( what ' s her name ?)"
austen#"for himself . He very handsomely hopes they will be happy together ; and there is nothing very unforgiving in that , I think ."" Anne did not receive the perfect conviction which the Admiral meant to convey , but it would have been useless to press the enquiry farther . She therefore satisfied herself with common - place remarks or quiet attention , and the Admiral had it all his own way . "" Poor Frederick !"" said he at last ."
austen#""" Now he must begin all over again with somebody else . I think we must get him to Bath . Sophy must write , and beg him to come to Bath . Here are pretty girls enough , I am sure . It would be of no use to go to Uppercross again , for that other Miss Musgrove , I find , is bespoke by her cousin , the young parson . Do not you think , Miss Elliot , we had better try to get him to Bath ?"""
austen#Chapter 19 While Admiral Croft was taking this walk with Anne , and expressing his wish of getting Captain Wentworth to Bath , Captain Wentworth was already on his way thither . Before Mrs Croft had written , he was arrived , and the very next time Anne walked out , she saw him . Mr Elliot was attending his two cousins and Mrs Clay . They were in Milsom Street . It began to rain , not much , but enough to make shelter desirable for women , and quite enough to make it very desirable for Miss Elliot to have the advantage of being conveyed home in Lady Dalrymple ' s carriage , which was seen waiting at a little distance ; she , Anne , and Mrs Clay , therefore , turned into Molland ' s , while Mr Elliot stepped to Lady Dalrymple , to request her assistance .
austen#He soon joined them again , successful , of course ; Lady Dalrymple would be most happy to take them home , and would call for them in a few minutes . Her ladyship ' s carriage was a barouche , and did not hold more than four with any comfort . Miss Carteret was with her mother ; consequently it was not reasonable to expect accommodation for all the three Camden Place ladies . There could be no doubt as to Miss Elliot . Whoever suffered inconvenience , she must suffer none , but it occupied a little time to settle the point of civility between the other two . The rain was a mere trifle , and Anne was most sincere in preferring a walk with Mr Elliot .
austen#But the rain was also a mere trifle to Mrs Clay ; she would hardly allow it even to drop at all , and her boots were so thick ! much thicker than Miss Anne ' s ; and , in short , her civility rendered her quite as anxious to be left to walk with Mr Elliot as Anne could be , and it was discussed between them with a generosity so polite and so determined , that the others were obliged to settle it for them ; Miss Elliot maintaining that Mrs Clay had a little cold already , and Mr Elliot deciding on appeal , that his cousin Anne ' s boots were rather the thickest . It was fixed accordingly , that Mrs Clay should be of the party in the carriage ; and they had just reached this point , when Anne , as she sat near the window , descried , most decidedly and distinctly , Captain Wentworth walking down the street . Her start was perceptible only to herself ; but she instantly felt that she was the greatest simpleton in the world , the most unaccountable and absurd ! For a few minutes she saw nothing before her ; it was all confusion . She was lost , and when she had scolded back her senses , she found the others still waiting for the carriage , and Mr Elliot ( always obliging ) just setting off for Union Street on a commission of Mrs Clay ' s .
austen#She now felt a great inclination to go to the outer door ; she wanted to see if it rained . Why was she to suspect herself of another motive ? Captain Wentworth must be out of sight . She left her seat , she would go ; one half of her should not be always so much wiser than the other half , or always suspecting the other of being worse than it was . She would see if it rained . She was sent back , however , in a moment by the entrance of Captain Wentworth himself , among a party of gentlemen and ladies , evidently his acquaintance , and whom he must have joined a little below Milsom Street .
austen#He was more obviously struck and confused by the sight of her than she had ever observed before ; he looked quite red . For the first time , since their renewed acquaintance , she felt that she was betraying the least sensibility of the two . She had the advantage of him in the preparation of the last few moments . All the overpowering , blinding , bewildering , first effects of strong surprise were over with her . Still , however , she had enough to feel ! It was agitation , pain , pleasure , a something between delight and misery .
austen#He spoke to her , and then turned away . The character of his manner was embarrassment . She could not have called it either cold or friendly , or anything so certainly as embarrassed . After a short interval , however , he came towards her , and spoke again . Mutual enquiries on common subjects passed : neither of them , probably , much the wiser for what they heard , and Anne continuing fully sensible of his being less at ease than formerly . They had by dint of being so very much together , got to speak to each other with a considerable portion of apparent indifference and calmness ; but he could not do it now .
austen#Time had changed him , or Louisa had changed him . There was consciousness of some sort or other . He looked very well , not as if he had been suffering in health or spirits , and he talked of Uppercross , of the Musgroves , nay , even of Louisa , and had even a momentary look of his own arch significance as he named her ; but yet it was Captain Wentworth not comfortable , not easy , not able to feign that he was . It did not surprise , but it grieved Anne to observe that Elizabeth would not know him . She saw that he saw Elizabeth , that Elizabeth saw him , that there was complete internal recognition on each side ; she was convinced that he was ready to be acknowledged as an acquaintance , expecting it , and she had the pain of seeing her sister turn away with unalterable coldness . Lady Dalrymple ' s carriage , for which Miss Elliot was growing very impatient , now drew up ; the servant came in to announce it .
austen#"It was beginning to rain again , and altogether there was a delay , and a bustle , and a talking , which must make all the little crowd in the shop understand that Lady Dalrymple was calling to convey Miss Elliot . At last Miss Elliot and her friend , unattended but by the servant , ( for there was no cousin returned ), were walking off ; and Captain Wentworth , watching them , turned again to Anne , and by manner , rather than words , was offering his services to her . "" I am much obliged to you ,"" was her answer , "" but I am not going with them . The carriage would not accommodate so many . I walk : I prefer walking ."" "" But it rains ."""
austen#""" Oh ! very little , Nothing that I regard ."" After a moment ' s pause he said : "" Though I came only yesterday , I have equipped myself properly for Bath already , you see ,"" ( pointing to a new umbrella ); "" I wish you would make use of it , if you are determined to walk ; though I think it would be more prudent to let me get you a chair ."" She was very much obliged to him , but declined it all , repeating her conviction , that the rain would come to nothing at present , and adding , "" I am only waiting for Mr Elliot . He will be here in a moment , I am sure ."" She had hardly spoken the words when Mr Elliot walked in ."
austen#"Captain Wentworth recollected him perfectly . There was no difference between him and the man who had stood on the steps at Lyme , admiring Anne as she passed , except in the air and look and manner of the privileged relation and friend . He came in with eagerness , appeared to see and think only of her , apologised for his stay , was grieved to have kept her waiting , and anxious to get her away without further loss of time and before the rain increased ; and in another moment they walked off together , her arm under his , a gentle and embarrassed glance , and a "" Good morning to you !"" being all that she had time for , as she passed away . As soon as they were out of sight , the ladies of Captain Wentworth ' s party began talking of them . "" Mr Elliot does not dislike his cousin , I fancy ?"""
austen#""" Oh ! no , that is clear enough . One can guess what will happen there . He is always with them ; half lives in the family , I believe . What a very good - looking man !"" "" Yes , and Miss Atkinson , who dined with him once at the Wallises , says he is the most agreeable man she ever was in company with ."""
austen#""" She is pretty , I think ; Anne Elliot ; very pretty , when one comes to look at her . It is not the fashion to say so , but I confess I admire her more than her sister ."" "" Oh ! so do I ."" "" And so do I . No comparison ."
austen#"But the men are all wild after Miss Elliot . Anne is too delicate for them ."" Anne would have been particularly obliged to her cousin , if he would have walked by her side all the way to Camden Place , without saying a word . She had never found it so difficult to listen to him , though nothing could exceed his solicitude and care , and though his subjects were principally such as were wont to be always interesting : praise , warm , just , and discriminating , of Lady Russell , and insinuations highly rational against Mrs Clay . But just now she could think only of Captain Wentworth . She could not understand his present feelings , whether he were really suffering much from disappointment or not ; and till that point were settled , she could not be quite herself ."
austen#She hoped to be wise and reasonable in time ; but alas ! alas ! she must confess to herself that she was not wise yet . Another circumstance very essential for her to know , was how long he meant to be in Bath ; he had not mentioned it , or she could not recollect it . He might be only passing through . But it was more probable that he should be come to stay .
austen#In that case , so liable as every body was to meet every body in Bath , Lady Russell would in all likelihood see him somewhere . Would she recollect him ? How would it all be ? She had already been obliged to tell Lady Russell that Louisa Musgrove was to marry Captain Benwick . It had cost her something to encounter Lady Russell ' s surprise ; and now , if she were by any chance to be thrown into company with Captain Wentworth , her imperfect knowledge of the matter might add another shade of prejudice against him . The following morning Anne was out with her friend , and for the first hour , in an incessant and fearful sort of watch for him in vain ; but at last , in returning down Pulteney Street , she distinguished him on the right hand pavement at such a distance as to have him in view the greater part of the street .
austen#There were many other men about him , many groups walking the same way , but there was no mistaking him . She looked instinctively at Lady Russell ; but not from any mad idea of her recognising him so soon as she did herself . No , it was not to be supposed that Lady Russell would perceive him till they were nearly opposite . She looked at her however , from time to time , anxiously ; and when the moment approached which must point him out , though not daring to look again ( for her own countenance she knew was unfit to be seen ), she was yet perfectly conscious of Lady Russell ' s eyes being turned exactly in the direction for him -- of her being , in short , intently observing him . She could thoroughly comprehend the sort of fascination he must possess over Lady Russell ' s mind , the difficulty it must be for her to withdraw her eyes , the astonishment she must be feeling that eight or nine years should have passed over him , and in foreign climes and in active service too , without robbing him of one personal grace ! At last , Lady Russell drew back her head .
austen#""" Now , how would she speak of him ?"" "" You will wonder ,"" said she , "" what has been fixing my eye so long ; but I was looking after some window - curtains , which Lady Alicia and Mrs Frankland were telling me of last night . They described the drawing - room window - curtains of one of the houses on this side of the way , and this part of the street , as being the handsomest and best hung of any in Bath , but could not recollect the exact number , and I have been trying to find out which it could be ; but I confess I can see no curtains hereabouts that answer their description ."" Anne sighed and blushed and smiled , in pity and disdain , either at her friend or herself . The part which provoked her most , was that in all this waste of foresight and caution , she should have lost the right moment for seeing whether he saw them . A day or two passed without producing anything ."
austen#The theatre or the rooms , where he was most likely to be , were not fashionable enough for the Elliots , whose evening amusements were solely in the elegant stupidity of private parties , in which they were getting more and more engaged ; and Anne , wearied of such a state of stagnation , sick of knowing nothing , and fancying herself stronger because her strength was not tried , was quite impatient for the concert evening . It was a concert for the benefit of a person patronised by Lady Dalrymple . Of course they must attend . It was really expected to be a good one , and Captain Wentworth was very fond of music . If she could only have a few minutes conversation with him again , she fancied she should be satisfied ; and as to the power of addressing him , she felt all over courage if the opportunity occurred . Elizabeth had turned from him , Lady Russell overlooked him ; her nerves were strengthened by these circumstances ; she felt that she owed him attention .
austen#"She had once partly promised Mrs Smith to spend the evening with her ; but in a short hurried call she excused herself and put it off , with the more decided promise of a longer visit on the morrow . Mrs Smith gave a most good - humoured acquiescence . "" By all means ,"" said she ; "" only tell me all about it , when you do come . Who is your party ?"" Anne named them all . Mrs Smith made no reply ; but when she was leaving her said , and with an expression half serious , half arch , "" Well , I heartily wish your concert may answer ; and do not fail me to - morrow if you can come ; for I begin to have a foreboding that I may not have many more visits from you ."""
austen#"Anne was startled and confused ; but after standing in a moment ' s suspense , was obliged , and not sorry to be obliged , to hurry away . Chapter 20 Sir Walter , his two daughters , and Mrs Clay , were the earliest of all their party at the rooms in the evening ; and as Lady Dalrymple must be waited for , they took their station by one of the fires in the Octagon Room . But hardly were they so settled , when the door opened again , and Captain Wentworth walked in alone . Anne was the nearest to him , and making yet a little advance , she instantly spoke . He was preparing only to bow and pass on , but her gentle "" How do you do ?"""
austen#brought him out of the straight line to stand near her , and make enquiries in return , in spite of the formidable father and sister in the back ground . Their being in the back ground was a support to Anne ; she knew nothing of their looks , and felt equal to everything which she believed right to be done . While they were speaking , a whispering between her father and Elizabeth caught her ear . She could not distinguish , but she must guess the subject ; and on Captain Wentworth ' s making a distant bow , she comprehended that her father had judged so well as to give him that simple acknowledgement of acquaintance , and she was just in time by a side glance to see a slight curtsey from Elizabeth herself . This , though late , and reluctant , and ungracious , was yet better than nothing , and her spirits improved . After talking , however , of the weather , and Bath , and the concert , their conversation began to flag , and so little was said at last , that she was expecting him to go every moment , but he did not ; he seemed in no hurry to leave her ; and presently with renewed spirit , with a little smile , a little glow , he said --
austen#""" I have hardly seen you since our day at Lyme . I am afraid you must have suffered from the shock , and the more from its not overpowering you at the time ."" She assured him that she had not . "" It was a frightful hour ,"" said he , "" a frightful day !"" and he passed his hand across his eyes , as if the remembrance were still too painful , but in a moment , half smiling again , added , "" The day has produced some effects however ; has had some consequences which must be considered as the very reverse of frightful . When you had the presence of mind to suggest that Benwick would be the properest person to fetch a surgeon , you could have little idea of his being eventually one of those most concerned in her recovery ."""
austen#""" Certainly I could have none . But it appears -- I should hope it would be a very happy match . There are on both sides good principles and good temper ."" "" Yes ,"" said he , looking not exactly forward ; "" but there , I think , ends the resemblance . With all my soul I wish them happy , and rejoice over every circumstance in favour of it . They have no difficulties to contend with at home , no opposition , no caprice , no delays ."
austen#"The Musgroves are behaving like themselves , most honourably and kindly , only anxious with true parental hearts to promote their daughter ' s comfort . All this is much , very much in favour of their happiness ; more than perhaps --"" He stopped . A sudden recollection seemed to occur , and to give him some taste of that emotion which was reddening Anne ' s cheeks and fixing her eyes on the ground . After clearing his throat , however , he proceeded thus -- "" I confess that I do think there is a disparity , too great a disparity , and in a point no less essential than mind ."
austen#I regard Louisa Musgrove as a very amiable , sweet - tempered girl , and not deficient in understanding , but Benwick is something more . He is a clever man , a reading man ; and I confess , that I do consider his attaching himself to her with some surprise . Had it been the effect of gratitude , had he learnt to love her , because he believed her to be preferring him , it would have been another thing . But I have no reason to suppose it so . It seems , on the contrary , to have been a perfectly spontaneous , untaught feeling on his side , and this surprises me . A man like him , in his situation !
austen#"with a heart pierced , wounded , almost broken ! Fanny Harville was a very superior creature , and his attachment to her was indeed attachment . A man does not recover from such a devotion of the heart to such a woman . He ought not ; he does not ."" Either from the consciousness , however , that his friend had recovered , or from other consciousness , he went no farther ; and Anne who , in spite of the agitated voice in which the latter part had been uttered , and in spite of all the various noises of the room , the almost ceaseless slam of the door , and ceaseless buzz of persons walking through , had distinguished every word , was struck , gratified , confused , and beginning to breathe very quick , and feel an hundred things in a moment . It was impossible for her to enter on such a subject ; and yet , after a pause , feeling the necessity of speaking , and having not the smallest wish for a total change , she only deviated so far as to say --"
austen#""" You were a good while at Lyme , I think ?"" "" About a fortnight . I could not leave it till Louisa ' s doing well was quite ascertained . I had been too deeply concerned in the mischief to be soon at peace . It had been my doing , solely mine . She would not have been obstinate if I had not been weak ."
austen#"The country round Lyme is very fine . I walked and rode a great deal ; and the more I saw , the more I found to admire ."" "" I should very much like to see Lyme again ,"" said Anne . "" Indeed ! I should not have supposed that you could have found anything in Lyme to inspire such a feeling . The horror and distress you were involved in , the stretch of mind , the wear of spirits !"
austen#"I should have thought your last impressions of Lyme must have been strong disgust ."" "" The last hours were certainly very painful ,"" replied Anne ; "" but when pain is over , the remembrance of it often becomes a pleasure . One does not love a place the less for having suffered in it , unless it has been all suffering , nothing but suffering , which was by no means the case at Lyme . We were only in anxiety and distress during the last two hours , and previously there had been a great deal of enjoyment . So much novelty and beauty ! I have travelled so little , that every fresh place would be interesting to me ; but there is real beauty at Lyme ; and in short "" ( with a faint blush at some recollections ), "" altogether my impressions of the place are very agreeable ."""
austen#"As she ceased , the entrance door opened again , and the very party appeared for whom they were waiting . "" Lady Dalrymple , Lady Dalrymple ,"" was the rejoicing sound ; and with all the eagerness compatible with anxious elegance , Sir Walter and his two ladies stepped forward to meet her . Lady Dalrymple and Miss Carteret , escorted by Mr Elliot and Colonel Wallis , who had happened to arrive nearly at the same instant , advanced into the room . The others joined them , and it was a group in which Anne found herself also necessarily included . She was divided from Captain Wentworth . Their interesting , almost too interesting conversation must be broken up for a time , but slight was the penance compared with the happiness which brought it on !"
austen#She had learnt , in the last ten minutes , more of his feelings towards Louisa , more of all his feelings than she dared to think of ; and she gave herself up to the demands of the party , to the needful civilities of the moment , with exquisite , though agitated sensations . She was in good humour with all . She had received ideas which disposed her to be courteous and kind to all , and to pity every one , as being less happy than herself . The delightful emotions were a little subdued , when on stepping back from the group , to be joined again by Captain Wentworth , she saw that he was gone . She was just in time to see him turn into the Concert Room . He was gone ; he had disappeared , she felt a moment ' s regret .
austen#"But "" they should meet again . He would look for her , he would find her out before the evening were over , and at present , perhaps , it was as well to be asunder . She was in need of a little interval for recollection ."" Upon Lady Russell ' s appearance soon afterwards , the whole party was collected , and all that remained was to marshal themselves , and proceed into the Concert Room ; and be of all the consequence in their power , draw as many eyes , excite as many whispers , and disturb as many people as they could . Very , very happy were both Elizabeth and Anne Elliot as they walked in . Elizabeth arm in arm with Miss Carteret , and looking on the broad back of the dowager Viscountess Dalrymple before her , had nothing to wish for which did not seem within her reach ; and Anne -- but it would be an insult to the nature of Anne ' s felicity , to draw any comparison between it and her sister ' s ; the origin of one all selfish vanity , of the other all generous attachment ."
austen#Anne saw nothing , thought nothing of the brilliancy of the room . Her happiness was from within . Her eyes were bright and her cheeks glowed ; but she knew nothing about it . She was thinking only of the last half hour , and as they passed to their seats , her mind took a hasty range over it . His choice of subjects , his expressions , and still more his manner and look , had been such as she could see in only one light . His opinion of Louisa Musgrove ' s inferiority , an opinion which he had seemed solicitous to give , his wonder at Captain Benwick , his feelings as to a first , strong attachment ; sentences begun which he could not finish , his half averted eyes and more than half expressive glance , all , all declared that he had a heart returning to her at least ; that anger , resentment , avoidance , were no more ; and that they were succeeded , not merely by friendship and regard , but by the tenderness of the past .
austen#Yes , some share of the tenderness of the past . She could not contemplate the change as implying less . He must love her . These were thoughts , with their attendant visions , which occupied and flurried her too much to leave her any power of observation ; and she passed along the room without having a glimpse of him , without even trying to discern him . When their places were determined on , and they were all properly arranged , she looked round to see if he should happen to be in the same part of the room , but he was not ; her eye could not reach him ; and the concert being just opening , she must consent for a time to be happy in a humbler way . The party was divided and disposed of on two contiguous benches : Anne was among those on the foremost , and Mr Elliot had manoeuvred so well , with the assistance of his friend Colonel Wallis , as to have a seat by her .
austen#"Miss Elliot , surrounded by her cousins , and the principal object of Colonel Wallis ' s gallantry , was quite contented . Anne ' s mind was in a most favourable state for the entertainment of the evening ; it was just occupation enough : she had feelings for the tender , spirits for the gay , attention for the scientific , and patience for the wearisome ; and had never liked a concert better , at least during the first act . Towards the close of it , in the interval succeeding an Italian song , she explained the words of the song to Mr Elliot . They had a concert bill between them . "" This ,"" said she , "" is nearly the sense , or rather the meaning of the words , for certainly the sense of an Italian love - song must not be talked of , but it is as nearly the meaning as I can give ; for I do not pretend to understand the language . I am a very poor Italian scholar ."""
austen#""" Yes , yes , I see you are . I see you know nothing of the matter . You have only knowledge enough of the language to translate at sight these inverted , transposed , curtailed Italian lines , into clear , comprehensible , elegant English . You need not say anything more of your ignorance . Here is complete proof ."" "" I will not oppose such kind politeness ; but I should be sorry to be examined by a real proficient ."""
austen#""" I have not had the pleasure of visiting in Camden Place so long ,"" replied he , "" without knowing something of Miss Anne Elliot ; and I do regard her as one who is too modest for the world in general to be aware of half her accomplishments , and too highly accomplished for modesty to be natural in any other woman ."" "" For shame ! for shame ! this is too much flattery . I forget what we are to have next ,"" turning to the bill . "" Perhaps ,"" said Mr Elliot , speaking low , "" I have had a longer acquaintance with your character than you are aware of ."""
austen#""" Indeed ! How so ? You can have been acquainted with it only since I came to Bath , excepting as you might hear me previously spoken of in my own family ."" "" I knew you by report long before you came to Bath . I had heard you described by those who knew you intimately . I have been acquainted with you by character many years ."
austen#"Your person , your disposition , accomplishments , manner ; they were all present to me ."" Mr Elliot was not disappointed in the interest he hoped to raise . No one can withstand the charm of such a mystery . To have been described long ago to a recent acquaintance , by nameless people , is irresistible ; and Anne was all curiosity . She wondered , and questioned him eagerly ; but in vain . He delighted in being asked , but he would not tell ."
austen#""" No , no , some time or other , perhaps , but not now . He would mention no names now ; but such , he could assure her , had been the fact . He had many years ago received such a description of Miss Anne Elliot as had inspired him with the highest idea of her merit , and excited the warmest curiosity to know her ."" Anne could think of no one so likely to have spoken with partiality of her many years ago as the Mr Wentworth of Monkford , Captain Wentworth ' s brother . He might have been in Mr Elliot ' s company , but she had not courage to ask the question . "" The name of Anne Elliot ,"" said he , "" has long had an interesting sound to me ."
austen#"Very long has it possessed a charm over my fancy ; and , if I dared , I would breathe my wishes that the name might never change ."" Such , she believed , were his words ; but scarcely had she received their sound , than her attention was caught by other sounds immediately behind her , which rendered every thing else trivial . Her father and Lady Dalrymple were speaking . "" A well - looking man ,"" said Sir Walter , "" a very well - looking man ."" "" A very fine young man indeed !"" said Lady Dalrymple ."
austen#""" More air than one often sees in Bath . Irish , I dare say ."" "" No , I just know his name . A bowing acquaintance . Wentworth ; Captain Wentworth of the navy . His sister married my tenant in Somersetshire , the Croft , who rents Kellynch ."""
austen#Before Sir Walter had reached this point , Anne ' s eyes had caught the right direction , and distinguished Captain Wentworth standing among a cluster of men at a little distance . As her eyes fell on him , his seemed to be withdrawn from her . It had that appearance . It seemed as if she had been one moment too late ; and as long as she dared observe , he did not look again : but the performance was recommencing , and she was forced to seem to restore her attention to the orchestra and look straight forward . When she could give another glance , he had moved away . He could not have come nearer to her if he would ; she was so surrounded and shut in : but she would rather have caught his eye .
austen#Mr Elliot ' s speech , too , distressed her . She had no longer any inclination to talk to him . She wished him not so near her . The first act was over . Now she hoped for some beneficial change ; and , after a period of nothing - saying amongst the party , some of them did decide on going in quest of tea . Anne was one of the few who did not choose to move .
austen#She remained in her seat , and so did Lady Russell ; but she had the pleasure of getting rid of Mr Elliot ; and she did not mean , whatever she might feel on Lady Russell ' s account , to shrink from conversation with Captain Wentworth , if he gave her the opportunity . She was persuaded by Lady Russell ' s countenance that she had seen him . He did not come however . Anne sometimes fancied she discerned him at a distance , but he never came . The anxious interval wore away unproductively . The others returned , the room filled again , benches were reclaimed and repossessed , and another hour of pleasure or of penance was to be sat out , another hour of music was to give delight or the gapes , as real or affected taste for it prevailed .
austen#To Anne , it chiefly wore the prospect of an hour of agitation . She could not quit that room in peace without seeing Captain Wentworth once more , without the interchange of one friendly look . In re - settling themselves there were now many changes , the result of which was favourable for her . Colonel Wallis declined sitting down again , and Mr Elliot was invited by Elizabeth and Miss Carteret , in a manner not to be refused , to sit between them ; and by some other removals , and a little scheming of her own , Anne was enabled to place herself much nearer the end of the bench than she had been before , much more within reach of a passer - by . She could not do so , without comparing herself with Miss Larolles , the inimitable Miss Larolles ; but still she did it , and not with much happier effect ; though by what seemed prosperity in the shape of an early abdication in her next neighbours , she found herself at the very end of the bench before the concert closed . Such was her situation , with a vacant space at hand , when Captain Wentworth was again in sight .
austen#She saw him not far off . He saw her too ; yet he looked grave , and seemed irresolute , and only by very slow degrees came at last near enough to speak to her . She felt that something must be the matter . The change was indubitable . The difference between his present air and what it had been in the Octagon Room was strikingly great . Why was it ?
austen#She thought of her father , of Lady Russell . Could there have been any unpleasant glances ? He began by speaking of the concert gravely , more like the Captain Wentworth of Uppercross ; owned himself disappointed , had expected singing ; and in short , must confess that he should not be sorry when it was over . Anne replied , and spoke in defence of the performance so well , and yet in allowance for his feelings so pleasantly , that his countenance improved , and he replied again with almost a smile . They talked for a few minutes more ; the improvement held ; he even looked down towards the bench , as if he saw a place on it well worth occupying ; when at that moment a touch on her shoulder obliged Anne to turn round . It came from Mr Elliot .
austen#"He begged her pardon , but she must be applied to , to explain Italian again . Miss Carteret was very anxious to have a general idea of what was next to be sung . Anne could not refuse ; but never had she sacrificed to politeness with a more suffering spirit . A few minutes , though as few as possible , were inevitably consumed ; and when her own mistress again , when able to turn and look as she had done before , she found herself accosted by Captain Wentworth , in a reserved yet hurried sort of farewell . "" He must wish her good night ; he was going ; he should get home as fast as he could ."" "" Is not this song worth staying for ?"""
austen#"said Anne , suddenly struck by an idea which made her yet more anxious to be encouraging . "" No !"" he replied impressively , "" there is nothing worth my staying for ;"" and he was gone directly . Jealousy of Mr Elliot ! It was the only intelligible motive . Captain Wentworth jealous of her affection !"
austen#Could she have believed it a week ago ; three hours ago ! For a moment the gratification was exquisite . But , alas ! there were very different thoughts to succeed . How was such jealousy to be quieted ? How was the truth to reach him ?
austen#How , in all the peculiar disadvantages of their respective situations , would he ever learn of her real sentiments ? It was misery to think of Mr Elliot ' s attentions . Their evil was incalculable . Chapter 21 Anne recollected with pleasure the next morning her promise of going to Mrs Smith , meaning that it should engage her from home at the time when Mr Elliot would be most likely to call ; for to avoid Mr Elliot was almost a first object . She felt a great deal of good - will towards him .
austen#In spite of the mischief of his attentions , she owed him gratitude and regard , perhaps compassion . She could not help thinking much of the extraordinary circumstances attending their acquaintance , of the right which he seemed to have to interest her , by everything in situation , by his own sentiments , by his early prepossession . It was altogether very extraordinary ; flattering , but painful . There was much to regret . How she might have felt had there been no Captain Wentworth in the case , was not worth enquiry ; for there was a Captain Wentworth ; and be the conclusion of the present suspense good or bad , her affection would be his for ever . Their union , she believed , could not divide her more from other men , than their final separation .
austen#Prettier musings of high - wrought love and eternal constancy , could never have passed along the streets of Bath , than Anne was sporting with from Camden Place to Westgate Buildings . It was almost enough to spread purification and perfume all the way . She was sure of a pleasant reception ; and her friend seemed this morning particularly obliged to her for coming , seemed hardly to have expected her , though it had been an appointment . An account of the concert was immediately claimed ; and Anne ' s recollections of the concert were quite happy enough to animate her features and make her rejoice to talk of it . All that she could tell she told most gladly , but the all was little for one who had been there , and unsatisfactory for such an enquirer as Mrs Smith , who had already heard , through the short cut of a laundress and a waiter , rather more of the general success and produce of the evening than Anne could relate , and who now asked in vain for several particulars of the company . Everybody of any consequence or notoriety in Bath was well know by name to Mrs Smith .
austen#""" The little Durands were there , I conclude ,"" said she , "" with their mouths open to catch the music , like unfledged sparrows ready to be fed . They never miss a concert ."" "" Yes ; I did not see them myself , but I heard Mr Elliot say they were in the room ."" "" The Ibbotsons , were they there ? and the two new beauties , with the tall Irish officer , who is talked of for one of them ."" "" I do not know ."
austen#"I do not think they were ."" "" Old Lady Mary Maclean ? I need not ask after her . She never misses , I know ; and you must have seen her . She must have been in your own circle ; for as you went with Lady Dalrymple , you were in the seats of grandeur , round the orchestra , of course ."" "" No , that was what I dreaded ."
austen#"It would have been very unpleasant to me in every respect . But happily Lady Dalrymple always chooses to be farther off ; and we were exceedingly well placed , that is , for hearing ; I must not say for seeing , because I appear to have seen very little ."" "" Oh ! you saw enough for your own amusement . I can understand . There is a sort of domestic enjoyment to be known even in a crowd , and this you had ."
austen#"You were a large party in yourselves , and you wanted nothing beyond ."" "" But I ought to have looked about me more ,"" said Anne , conscious while she spoke that there had in fact been no want of looking about , that the object only had been deficient . "" No , no ; you were better employed . You need not tell me that you had a pleasant evening . I see it in your eye . I perfectly see how the hours passed : that you had always something agreeable to listen to ."
austen#"In the intervals of the concert it was conversation ."" Anne half smiled and said , "" Do you see that in my eye ?"" "" Yes , I do . Your countenance perfectly informs me that you were in company last night with the person whom you think the most agreeable in the world , the person who interests you at this present time more than all the rest of the world put together ."" A blush overspread Anne ' s cheeks . She could say nothing ."
austen#""" And such being the case ,"" continued Mrs Smith , after a short pause , "" I hope you believe that I do know how to value your kindness in coming to me this morning . It is really very good of you to come and sit with me , when you must have so many pleasanter demands upon your time ."" Anne heard nothing of this . She was still in the astonishment and confusion excited by her friend ' s penetration , unable to imagine how any report of Captain Wentworth could have reached her . After another short silence -- "" Pray ,"" said Mrs Smith , "" is Mr Elliot aware of your acquaintance with me ?"
austen#"Does he know that I am in Bath ?"" "" Mr Elliot !"" repeated Anne , looking up surprised . A moment ' s reflection shewed her the mistake she had been under . She caught it instantaneously ; and recovering her courage with the feeling of safety , soon added , more composedly , "" Are you acquainted with Mr Elliot ?"" "" I have been a good deal acquainted with him ,"" replied Mrs Smith , gravely , "" but it seems worn out now ."
austen#"It is a great while since we met ."" "" I was not at all aware of this . You never mentioned it before . Had I known it , I would have had the pleasure of talking to him about you ."" "" To confess the truth ,"" said Mrs Smith , assuming her usual air of cheerfulness , "" that is exactly the pleasure I want you to have . I want you to talk about me to Mr Elliot ."
austen#"I want your interest with him . He can be of essential service to me ; and if you would have the goodness , my dear Miss Elliot , to make it an object to yourself , of course it is done ."" "" I should be extremely happy ; I hope you cannot doubt my willingness to be of even the slightest use to you ,"" replied Anne ; "" but I suspect that you are considering me as having a higher claim on Mr Elliot , a greater right to influence him , than is really the case . I am sure you have , somehow or other , imbibed such a notion . You must consider me only as Mr Elliot ' s relation . If in that light there is anything which you suppose his cousin might fairly ask of him , I beg you would not hesitate to employ me ."""
austen#"Mrs Smith gave her a penetrating glance , and then , smiling , said -- "" I have been a little premature , I perceive ; I beg your pardon . I ought to have waited for official information , But now , my dear Miss Elliot , as an old friend , do give me a hint as to when I may speak . Next week ? To be sure by next week I may be allowed to think it all settled , and build my own selfish schemes on Mr Elliot ' s good fortune ."" "" No ,"" replied Anne , "" nor next week , nor next , nor next ."
austen#"I assure you that nothing of the sort you are thinking of will be settled any week . I am not going to marry Mr Elliot . I should like to know why you imagine I am ?"" Mrs Smith looked at her again , looked earnestly , smiled , shook her head , and exclaimed -- "" Now , how I do wish I understood you ! How I do wish I knew what you were at !"
austen#I have a great idea that you do not design to be cruel , when the right moment occurs . Till it does come , you know , we women never mean to have anybody . It is a thing of course among us , that every man is refused , till he offers . But why should you be cruel ? Let me plead for my -- present friend I cannot call him , but for my former friend . Where can you look for a more suitable match ?
austen#"Where could you expect a more gentlemanlike , agreeable man ? Let me recommend Mr Elliot . I am sure you hear nothing but good of him from Colonel Wallis ; and who can know him better than Colonel Wallis ?"" "" My dear Mrs Smith , Mr Elliot ' s wife has not been dead much above half a year . He ought not to be supposed to be paying his addresses to any one ."" "" Oh !"
austen#"if these are your only objections ,"" cried Mrs Smith , archly , "" Mr Elliot is safe , and I shall give myself no more trouble about him . Do not forget me when you are married , that ' s all . Let him know me to be a friend of yours , and then he will think little of the trouble required , which it is very natural for him now , with so many affairs and engagements of his own , to avoid and get rid of as he can ; very natural , perhaps . Ninety - nine out of a hundred would do the same . Of course , he cannot be aware of the importance to me . Well , my dear Miss Elliot , I hope and trust you will be very happy ."
austen#"Mr Elliot has sense to understand the value of such a woman . Your peace will not be shipwrecked as mine has been . You are safe in all worldly matters , and safe in his character . He will not be led astray ; he will not be misled by others to his ruin ."" "" No ,"" said Anne , "" I can readily believe all that of my cousin . He seems to have a calm decided temper , not at all open to dangerous impressions ."
austen#I consider him with great respect . I have no reason , from any thing that has fallen within my observation , to do otherwise . But I have not known him long ; and he is not a man , I think , to be known intimately soon . Will not this manner of speaking of him , Mrs Smith , convince you that he is nothing to me ? Surely this must be calm enough . And , upon my word , he is nothing to me .
austen#"Should he ever propose to me ( which I have very little reason to imagine he has any thought of doing ), I shall not accept him . I assure you I shall not . I assure you , Mr Elliot had not the share which you have been supposing , in whatever pleasure the concert of last night might afford : not Mr Elliot ; it is not Mr Elliot that --"" She stopped , regretting with a deep blush that she had implied so much ; but less would hardly have been sufficient . Mrs Smith would hardly have believed so soon in Mr Elliot ' s failure , but from the perception of there being a somebody else . As it was , she instantly submitted , and with all the semblance of seeing nothing beyond ; and Anne , eager to escape farther notice , was impatient to know why Mrs Smith should have fancied she was to marry Mr Elliot ; where she could have received the idea , or from whom she could have heard it ."
austen#""" Do tell me how it first came into your head ."" "" It first came into my head ,"" replied Mrs Smith , "" upon finding how much you were together , and feeling it to be the most probable thing in the world to be wished for by everybody belonging to either of you ; and you may depend upon it that all your acquaintance have disposed of you in the same way . But I never heard it spoken of till two days ago ."" "" And has it indeed been spoken of ?"" "" Did you observe the woman who opened the door to you when you called yesterday ?"" "" No ."
austen#"Was not it Mrs Speed , as usual , or the maid ? I observed no one in particular ."" "" It was my friend Mrs Rooke ; Nurse Rooke ; who , by - the - bye , had a great curiosity to see you , and was delighted to be in the way to let you in . She came away from Marlborough Buildings only on Sunday ; and she it was who told me you were to marry Mr Elliot . She had had it from Mrs Wallis herself , which did not seem bad authority . She sat an hour with me on Monday evening , and gave me the whole history ."""
austen#[ Sense and Sensibility by Jane Austen 1811 ] CHAPTER 1 The family of Dashwood had long been settled in Sussex . Their estate was large , and their residence was at Norland Park , in the centre of their property , where , for many generations , they had lived in so respectable a manner as to engage the general good opinion of their surrounding acquaintance . The late owner of this estate was a single man , who lived to a very advanced age , and who for many years of his life , had a constant companion and housekeeper in his sister . But her death , which happened ten years before his own , produced a great alteration in his home ; for to supply her loss , he invited and received into his house the family of his nephew Mr . Henry Dashwood , the legal inheritor of the Norland estate , and the person to whom he intended to bequeath it .
austen#In the society of his nephew and niece , and their children , the old Gentleman ' s days were comfortably spent . His attachment to them all increased . The constant attention of Mr . and Mrs . Henry Dashwood to his wishes , which proceeded not merely from interest , but from goodness of heart , gave him every degree of solid comfort which his age could receive ; and the cheerfulness of the children added a relish to his existence . By a former marriage , Mr . Henry Dashwood had one son : by his present lady , three daughters . The son , a steady respectable young man , was amply provided for by the fortune of his mother , which had been large , and half of which devolved on him on his coming of age . By his own marriage , likewise , which happened soon afterwards , he added to his wealth .
austen#To him therefore the succession to the Norland estate was not so really important as to his sisters ; for their fortune , independent of what might arise to them from their father ' s inheriting that property , could be but small . Their mother had nothing , and their father only seven thousand pounds in his own disposal ; for the remaining moiety of his first wife ' s fortune was also secured to her child , and he had only a life - interest in it . The old gentleman died : his will was read , and like almost every other will , gave as much disappointment as pleasure . He was neither so unjust , nor so ungrateful , as to leave his estate from his nephew ;-- but he left it to him on such terms as destroyed half the value of the bequest . Mr . Dashwood had wished for it more for the sake of his wife and daughters than for himself or his son ;-- but to his son , and his son ' s son , a child of four years old , it was secured , in such a way , as to leave to himself no power of providing for those who were most dear to him , and who most needed a provision by any charge on the estate , or by any sale of its valuable woods . The whole was tied up for the benefit of this child , who , in occasional visits with his father and mother at Norland , had so far gained on the affections of his uncle , by such attractions as are by no means unusual in children of two or three years old ; an imperfect articulation , an earnest desire of having his own way , many cunning tricks , and a great deal of noise , as to outweigh all the value of all the attention which , for years , he had received from his niece and her daughters .
austen#He meant not to be unkind , however , and , as a mark of his affection for the three girls , he left them a thousand pounds a - piece . Mr . Dashwood ' s disappointment was , at first , severe ; but his temper was cheerful and sanguine ; and he might reasonably hope to live many years , and by living economically , lay by a considerable sum from the produce of an estate already large , and capable of almost immediate improvement . But the fortune , which had been so tardy in coming , was his only one twelvemonth . He survived his uncle no longer ; and ten thousand pounds , including the late legacies , was all that remained for his widow and daughters . His son was sent for as soon as his danger was known , and to him Mr . Dashwood recommended , with all the strength and urgency which illness could command , the interest of his mother - in - law and sisters . Mr . John Dashwood had not the strong feelings of the rest of the family ; but he was affected by a recommendation of such a nature at such a time , and he promised to do every thing in his power to make them comfortable .
austen#His father was rendered easy by such an assurance , and Mr . John Dashwood had then leisure to consider how much there might prudently be in his power to do for them . He was not an ill - disposed young man , unless to be rather cold hearted and rather selfish is to be ill - disposed : but he was , in general , well respected ; for he conducted himself with propriety in the discharge of his ordinary duties . Had he married a more amiable woman , he might have been made still more respectable than he was :-- he might even have been made amiable himself ; for he was very young when he married , and very fond of his wife . But Mrs . John Dashwood was a strong caricature of himself ;-- more narrow - minded and selfish . When he gave his promise to his father , he meditated within himself to increase the fortunes of his sisters by the present of a thousand pounds a - piece . He then really thought himself equal to it .
austen#"The prospect of four thousand a - year , in addition to his present income , besides the remaining half of his own mother ' s fortune , warmed his heart , and made him feel capable of generosity .-- "" Yes , he would give them three thousand pounds : it would be liberal and handsome ! It would be enough to make them completely easy . Three thousand pounds ! he could spare so considerable a sum with little inconvenience ."" -- He thought of it all day long , and for many days successively , and he did not repent . No sooner was his father ' s funeral over , than Mrs . John Dashwood , without sending any notice of her intention to her mother - in - law , arrived with her child and their attendants ."
austen#No one could dispute her right to come ; the house was her husband ' s from the moment of his father ' s decease ; but the indelicacy of her conduct was so much the greater , and to a woman in Mrs . Dashwood ' s situation , with only common feelings , must have been highly unpleasing ;-- but in HER mind there was a sense of honor so keen , a generosity so romantic , that any offence of the kind , by whomsoever given or received , was to her a source of immoveable disgust . Mrs . John Dashwood had never been a favourite with any of her husband ' s family ; but she had had no opportunity , till the present , of shewing them with how little attention to the comfort of other people she could act when occasion required it . So acutely did Mrs . Dashwood feel this ungracious behaviour , and so earnestly did she despise her daughter - in - law for it , that , on the arrival of the latter , she would have quitted the house for ever , had not the entreaty of her eldest girl induced her first to reflect on the propriety of going , and her own tender love for all her three children determined her afterwards to stay , and for their sakes avoid a breach with their brother . Elinor , this eldest daughter , whose advice was so effectual , possessed a strength of understanding , and coolness of judgment , which qualified her , though only nineteen , to be the counsellor of her mother , and enabled her frequently to counteract , to the advantage of them all , that eagerness of mind in Mrs . Dashwood which must generally have led to imprudence . She had an excellent heart ;-- her disposition was affectionate , and her feelings were strong ; but she knew how to govern them : it was a knowledge which her mother had yet to learn ; and which one of her sisters had resolved never to be taught . Marianne ' s abilities were , in many respects , quite equal to Elinor ' s .
austen#She was sensible and clever ; but eager in everything : her sorrows , her joys , could have no moderation . She was generous , amiable , interesting : she was everything but prudent . The resemblance between her and her mother was strikingly great . Elinor saw , with concern , the excess of her sister ' s sensibility ; but by Mrs . Dashwood it was valued and cherished . They encouraged each other now in the violence of their affliction . The agony of grief which overpowered them at first , was voluntarily renewed , was sought for , was created again and again .
austen#They gave themselves up wholly to their sorrow , seeking increase of wretchedness in every reflection that could afford it , and resolved against ever admitting consolation in future . Elinor , too , was deeply afflicted ; but still she could struggle , she could exert herself . She could consult with her brother , could receive her sister - in - law on her arrival , and treat her with proper attention ; and could strive to rouse her mother to similar exertion , and encourage her to similar forbearance . Margaret , the other sister , was a good - humored , well - disposed girl ; but as she had already imbibed a good deal of Marianne ' s romance , without having much of her sense , she did not , at thirteen , bid fair to equal her sisters at a more advanced period of life . CHAPTER 2 Mrs . John Dashwood now installed herself mistress of Norland ; and her mother and sisters - in - law were degraded to the condition of visitors .
austen#As such , however , they were treated by her with quiet civility ; and by her husband with as much kindness as he could feel towards anybody beyond himself , his wife , and their child . He really pressed them , with some earnestness , to consider Norland as their home ; and , as no plan appeared so eligible to Mrs . Dashwood as remaining there till she could accommodate herself with a house in the neighbourhood , his invitation was accepted . A continuance in a place where everything reminded her of former delight , was exactly what suited her mind . In seasons of cheerfulness , no temper could be more cheerful than hers , or possess , in a greater degree , that sanguine expectation of happiness which is happiness itself . But in sorrow she must be equally carried away by her fancy , and as far beyond consolation as in pleasure she was beyond alloy . Mrs . John Dashwood did not at all approve of what her husband intended to do for his sisters .
austen#"To take three thousand pounds from the fortune of their dear little boy would be impoverishing him to the most dreadful degree . She begged him to think again on the subject . How could he answer it to himself to rob his child , and his only child too , of so large a sum ? And what possible claim could the Miss Dashwoods , who were related to him only by half blood , which she considered as no relationship at all , have on his generosity to so large an amount . It was very well known that no affection was ever supposed to exist between the children of any man by different marriages ; and why was he to ruin himself , and their poor little Harry , by giving away all his money to his half sisters ? "" It was my father ' s last request to me ,"" replied her husband , "" that I should assist his widow and daughters ."""
austen#""" He did not know what he was talking of , I dare say ; ten to one but he was light - headed at the time . Had he been in his right senses , he could not have thought of such a thing as begging you to give away half your fortune from your own child ."" "" He did not stipulate for any particular sum , my dear Fanny ; he only requested me , in general terms , to assist them , and make their situation more comfortable than it was in his power to do . Perhaps it would have been as well if he had left it wholly to myself . He could hardly suppose I should neglect them . But as he required the promise , I could not do less than give it ; at least I thought so at the time ."
austen#"The promise , therefore , was given , and must be performed . Something must be done for them whenever they leave Norland and settle in a new home ."" "" Well , then , LET something be done for them ; but THAT something need not be three thousand pounds . Consider ,"" she added , "" that when the money is once parted with , it never can return . Your sisters will marry , and it will be gone for ever . If , indeed , it could be restored to our poor little boy --"""
austen#""" Why , to be sure ,"" said her husband , very gravely , "" that would make great difference . The time may come when Harry will regret that so large a sum was parted with . If he should have a numerous family , for instance , it would be a very convenient addition ."" "" To be sure it would ."" "" Perhaps , then , it would be better for all parties , if the sum were diminished one half .-- Five hundred pounds would be a prodigious increase to their fortunes !"" "" Oh !"
austen#"beyond anything great ! What brother on earth would do half so much for his sisters , even if REALLY his sisters ! And as it is -- only half blood !-- But you have such a generous spirit !"" "" I would not wish to do any thing mean ,"" he replied . "" One had rather , on such occasions , do too much than too little . No one , at least , can think I have not done enough for them : even themselves , they can hardly expect more ."""
austen#""" There is no knowing what THEY may expect ,"" said the lady , "" but we are not to think of their expectations : the question is , what you can afford to do ."" "" Certainly -- and I think I may afford to give them five hundred pounds a - piece . As it is , without any addition of mine , they will each have about three thousand pounds on their mother ' s death -- a very comfortable fortune for any young woman ."" "" To be sure it is ; and , indeed , it strikes me that they can want no addition at all . They will have ten thousand pounds divided amongst them . If they marry , they will be sure of doing well , and if they do not , they may all live very comfortably together on the interest of ten thousand pounds ."""
austen#""" That is very true , and , therefore , I do not know whether , upon the whole , it would not be more advisable to do something for their mother while she lives , rather than for them -- something of the annuity kind I mean .-- My sisters would feel the good effects of it as well as herself . A hundred a year would make them all perfectly comfortable ."" His wife hesitated a little , however , in giving her consent to this plan . "" To be sure ,"" said she , "" it is better than parting with fifteen hundred pounds at once . But , then , if Mrs . Dashwood should live fifteen years we shall be completely taken in ."" "" Fifteen years !"
austen#"my dear Fanny ; her life cannot be worth half that purchase ."" "" Certainly not ; but if you observe , people always live for ever when there is an annuity to be paid them ; and she is very stout and healthy , and hardly forty . An annuity is a very serious business ; it comes over and over every year , and there is no getting rid of it . You are not aware of what you are doing . I have known a great deal of the trouble of annuities ; for my mother was clogged with the payment of three to old superannuated servants by my father ' s will , and it is amazing how disagreeable she found it . Twice every year these annuities were to be paid ; and then there was the trouble of getting it to them ; and then one of them was said to have died , and afterwards it turned out to be no such thing ."
austen#"My mother was quite sick of it . Her income was not her own , she said , with such perpetual claims on it ; and it was the more unkind in my father , because , otherwise , the money would have been entirely at my mother ' s disposal , without any restriction whatever . It has given me such an abhorrence of annuities , that I am sure I would not pin myself down to the payment of one for all the world ."" "" It is certainly an unpleasant thing ,"" replied Mr . Dashwood , "" to have those kind of yearly drains on one ' s income . One ' s fortune , as your mother justly says , is NOT one ' s own . To be tied down to the regular payment of such a sum , on every rent day , is by no means desirable : it takes away one ' s independence ."""
austen#""" Undoubtedly ; and after all you have no thanks for it . They think themselves secure , you do no more than what is expected , and it raises no gratitude at all . If I were you , whatever I did should be done at my own discretion entirely . I would not bind myself to allow them any thing yearly . It may be very inconvenient some years to spare a hundred , or even fifty pounds from our own expenses ."" "" I believe you are right , my love ; it will be better that there should by no annuity in the case ; whatever I may give them occasionally will be of far greater assistance than a yearly allowance , because they would only enlarge their style of living if they felt sure of a larger income , and would not be sixpence the richer for it at the end of the year ."
austen#"It will certainly be much the best way . A present of fifty pounds , now and then , will prevent their ever being distressed for money , and will , I think , be amply discharging my promise to my father ."" "" To be sure it will . Indeed , to say the truth , I am convinced within myself that your father had no idea of your giving them any money at all . The assistance he thought of , I dare say , was only such as might be reasonably expected of you ; for instance , such as looking out for a comfortable small house for them , helping them to move their things , and sending them presents of fish and game , and so forth , whenever they are in season . I ' ll lay my life that he meant nothing farther ; indeed , it would be very strange and unreasonable if he did ."
austen#Do but consider , my dear Mr . Dashwood , how excessively comfortable your mother - in - law and her daughters may live on the interest of seven thousand pounds , besides the thousand pounds belonging to each of the girls , which brings them in fifty pounds a year a - piece , and , of course , they will pay their mother for their board out of it . Altogether , they will have five hundred a - year amongst them , and what on earth can four women want for more than that ?-- They will live so cheap ! Their housekeeping will be nothing at all . They will have no carriage , no horses , and hardly any servants ; they will keep no company , and can have no expenses of any kind ! Only conceive how comfortable they will be ! Five hundred a year !
austen#"I am sure I cannot imagine how they will spend half of it ; and as to your giving them more , it is quite absurd to think of it . They will be much more able to give YOU something ."" "" Upon my word ,"" said Mr . Dashwood , "" I believe you are perfectly right . My father certainly could mean nothing more by his request to me than what you say . I clearly understand it now , and I will strictly fulfil my engagement by such acts of assistance and kindness to them as you have described . When my mother removes into another house my services shall be readily given to accommodate her as far as I can ."
austen#"Some little present of furniture too may be acceptable then ."" "" Certainly ,"" returned Mrs . John Dashwood . "" But , however , ONE thing must be considered . When your father and mother moved to Norland , though the furniture of Stanhill was sold , all the china , plate , and linen was saved , and is now left to your mother . Her house will therefore be almost completely fitted up as soon as she takes it ."" "" That is a material consideration undoubtedly ."
austen#"A valuable legacy indeed ! And yet some of the plate would have been a very pleasant addition to our own stock here ."" "" Yes ; and the set of breakfast china is twice as handsome as what belongs to this house . A great deal too handsome , in my opinion , for any place THEY can ever afford to live in . But , however , so it is . Your father thought only of THEM ."
austen#"And I must say this : that you owe no particular gratitude to him , nor attention to his wishes ; for we very well know that if he could , he would have left almost everything in the world to THEM ."" This argument was irresistible . It gave to his intentions whatever of decision was wanting before ; and he finally resolved , that it would be absolutely unnecessary , if not highly indecorous , to do more for the widow and children of his father , than such kind of neighbourly acts as his own wife pointed out . CHAPTER 3 Mrs . Dashwood remained at Norland several months ; not from any disinclination to move when the sight of every well known spot ceased to raise the violent emotion which it produced for a while ; for when her spirits began to revive , and her mind became capable of some other exertion than that of heightening its affliction by melancholy remembrances , she was impatient to be gone , and indefatigable in her inquiries for a suitable dwelling in the neighbourhood of Norland ; for to remove far from that beloved spot was impossible . But she could hear of no situation that at once answered her notions of comfort and ease , and suited the prudence of her eldest daughter , whose steadier judgment rejected several houses as too large for their income , which her mother would have approved ."
austen#Mrs . Dashwood had been informed by her husband of the solemn promise on the part of his son in their favour , which gave comfort to his last earthly reflections . She doubted the sincerity of this assurance no more than he had doubted it himself , and she thought of it for her daughters ' sake with satisfaction , though as for herself she was persuaded that a much smaller provision than 7000L would support her in affluence . For their brother ' s sake , too , for the sake of his own heart , she rejoiced ; and she reproached herself for being unjust to his merit before , in believing him incapable of generosity . His attentive behaviour to herself and his sisters convinced her that their welfare was dear to him , and , for a long time , she firmly relied on the liberality of his intentions . The contempt which she had , very early in their acquaintance , felt for her daughter - in - law , was very much increased by the farther knowledge of her character , which half a year ' s residence in her family afforded ; and perhaps in spite of every consideration of politeness or maternal affection on the side of the former , the two ladies might have found it impossible to have lived together so long , had not a particular circumstance occurred to give still greater eligibility , according to the opinions of Mrs . Dashwood , to her daughters ' continuance at Norland . This circumstance was a growing attachment between her eldest girl and the brother of Mrs . John Dashwood , a gentleman - like and pleasing young man , who was introduced to their acquaintance soon after his sister ' s establishment at Norland , and who had since spent the greatest part of his time there .
austen#Some mothers might have encouraged the intimacy from motives of interest , for Edward Ferrars was the eldest son of a man who had died very rich ; and some might have repressed it from motives of prudence , for , except a trifling sum , the whole of his fortune depended on the will of his mother . But Mrs . Dashwood was alike uninfluenced by either consideration . It was enough for her that he appeared to be amiable , that he loved her daughter , and that Elinor returned the partiality . It was contrary to every doctrine of her ' s that difference of fortune should keep any couple asunder who were attracted by resemblance of disposition ; and that Elinor ' s merit should not be acknowledged by every one who knew her , was to her comprehension impossible . Edward Ferrars was not recommended to their good opinion by any peculiar graces of person or address . He was not handsome , and his manners required intimacy to make them pleasing .
austen#He was too diffident to do justice to himself ; but when his natural shyness was overcome , his behaviour gave every indication of an open , affectionate heart . His understanding was good , and his education had given it solid improvement . But he was neither fitted by abilities nor disposition to answer the wishes of his mother and sister , who longed to see him distinguished -- as -- they hardly knew what . They wanted him to make a fine figure in the world in some manner or other . His mother wished to interest him in political concerns , to get him into parliament , or to see him connected with some of the great men of the day . Mrs . John Dashwood wished it likewise ; but in the mean while , till one of these superior blessings could be attained , it would have quieted her ambition to see him driving a barouche .
austen#But Edward had no turn for great men or barouches . All his wishes centered in domestic comfort and the quiet of private life . Fortunately he had a younger brother who was more promising . Edward had been staying several weeks in the house before he engaged much of Mrs . Dashwood ' s attention ; for she was , at that time , in such affliction as rendered her careless of surrounding objects . She saw only that he was quiet and unobtrusive , and she liked him for it . He did not disturb the wretchedness of her mind by ill - timed conversation .
austen#"She was first called to observe and approve him farther , by a reflection which Elinor chanced one day to make on the difference between him and his sister . It was a contrast which recommended him most forcibly to her mother . "" It is enough ,"" said she ; "" to say that he is unlike Fanny is enough . It implies everything amiable . I love him already ."" "" I think you will like him ,"" said Elinor , "" when you know more of him ."""
austen#""" Like him !"" replied her mother with a smile . "" I feel no sentiment of approbation inferior to love ."" "" You may esteem him ."" "" I have never yet known what it was to separate esteem and love ."" Mrs . Dashwood now took pains to get acquainted with him ."
austen#"Her manners were attaching , and soon banished his reserve . She speedily comprehended all his merits ; the persuasion of his regard for Elinor perhaps assisted her penetration ; but she really felt assured of his worth : and even that quietness of manner , which militated against all her established ideas of what a young man ' s address ought to be , was no longer uninteresting when she knew his heart to be warm and his temper affectionate . No sooner did she perceive any symptom of love in his behaviour to Elinor , than she considered their serious attachment as certain , and looked forward to their marriage as rapidly approaching . "" In a few months , my dear Marianne ."" said she , "" Elinor will , in all probability be settled for life . We shall miss her ; but SHE will be happy ."""
austen#""" Oh ! Mamma , how shall we do without her ?"" "" My love , it will be scarcely a separation . We shall live within a few miles of each other , and shall meet every day of our lives . You will gain a brother , a real , affectionate brother . I have the highest opinion in the world of Edward ' s heart ."
austen#"But you look grave , Marianne ; do you disapprove your sister ' s choice ?"" "" Perhaps ,"" said Marianne , "" I may consider it with some surprise . Edward is very amiable , and I love him tenderly . But yet -- he is not the kind of young man -- there is something wanting -- his figure is not striking ; it has none of that grace which I should expect in the man who could seriously attach my sister . His eyes want all that spirit , that fire , which at once announce virtue and intelligence . And besides all this , I am afraid , Mamma , he has no real taste ."
austen#Music seems scarcely to attract him , and though he admires Elinor ' s drawings very much , it is not the admiration of a person who can understand their worth . It is evident , in spite of his frequent attention to her while she draws , that in fact he knows nothing of the matter . He admires as a lover , not as a connoisseur . To satisfy me , those characters must be united . I could not be happy with a man whose taste did not in every point coincide with my own . He must enter into all my feelings ; the same books , the same music must charm us both .
austen#"Oh ! mama , how spiritless , how tame was Edward ' s manner in reading to us last night ! I felt for my sister most severely . Yet she bore it with so much composure , she seemed scarcely to notice it . I could hardly keep my seat . To hear those beautiful lines which have frequently almost driven me wild , pronounced with such impenetrable calmness , such dreadful indifference !"""
austen#"-- "" He would certainly have done more justice to simple and elegant prose . I thought so at the time ; but you WOULD give him Cowper ."" "" Nay , Mamma , if he is not to be animated by Cowper !-- but we must allow for difference of taste . Elinor has not my feelings , and therefore she may overlook it , and be happy with him . But it would have broke MY heart , had I loved him , to hear him read with so little sensibility ."
austen#"Mama , the more I know of the world , the more am I convinced that I shall never see a man whom I can really love . I require so much ! He must have all Edward ' s virtues , and his person and manners must ornament his goodness with every possible charm ."" "" Remember , my love , that you are not seventeen . It is yet too early in life to despair of such a happiness . Why should you be less fortunate than your mother ?"
austen#"In one circumstance only , my Marianne , may your destiny be different from her ' s !"" CHAPTER 4 "" What a pity it is , Elinor ,"" said Marianne , "" that Edward should have no taste for drawing ."" "" No taste for drawing !"" replied Elinor , "" why should you think so ? He does not draw himself , indeed , but he has great pleasure in seeing the performances of other people , and I assure you he is by no means deficient in natural taste , though he has not had opportunities of improving it ."
austen#"Had he ever been in the way of learning , I think he would have drawn very well . He distrusts his own judgment in such matters so much , that he is always unwilling to give his opinion on any picture ; but he has an innate propriety and simplicity of taste , which in general direct him perfectly right ."" Marianne was afraid of offending , and said no more on the subject ; but the kind of approbation which Elinor described as excited in him by the drawings of other people , was very far from that rapturous delight , which , in her opinion , could alone be called taste . Yet , though smiling within herself at the mistake , she honoured her sister for that blind partiality to Edward which produced it . "" I hope , Marianne ,"" continued Elinor , "" you do not consider him as deficient in general taste . Indeed , I think I may say that you cannot , for your behaviour to him is perfectly cordial , and if THAT were your opinion , I am sure you could never be civil to him ."""
austen#"Marianne hardly knew what to say . She would not wound the feelings of her sister on any account , and yet to say what she did not believe was impossible . At length she replied : "" Do not be offended , Elinor , if my praise of him is not in every thing equal to your sense of his merits . I have not had so many opportunities of estimating the minuter propensities of his mind , his inclinations and tastes , as you have ; but I have the highest opinion in the world of his goodness and sense . I think him every thing that is worthy and amiable ."""
austen#""" I am sure ,"" replied Elinor , with a smile , "" that his dearest friends could not be dissatisfied with such commendation as that . I do not perceive how you could express yourself more warmly ."" Marianne was rejoiced to find her sister so easily pleased . "" Of his sense and his goodness ,"" continued Elinor , "" no one can , I think , be in doubt , who has seen him often enough to engage him in unreserved conversation . The excellence of his understanding and his principles can be concealed only by that shyness which too often keeps him silent . You know enough of him to do justice to his solid worth ."
austen#But of his minuter propensities , as you call them you have from peculiar circumstances been kept more ignorant than myself . He and I have been at times thrown a good deal together , while you have been wholly engrossed on the most affectionate principle by my mother . I have seen a great deal of him , have studied his sentiments and heard his opinion on subjects of literature and taste ; and , upon the whole , I venture to pronounce that his mind is well - informed , enjoyment of books exceedingly great , his imagination lively , his observation just and correct , and his taste delicate and pure . His abilities in every respect improve as much upon acquaintance as his manners and person . At first sight , his address is certainly not striking ; and his person can hardly be called handsome , till the expression of his eyes , which are uncommonly good , and the general sweetness of his countenance , is perceived . At present , I know him so well , that I think him really handsome ; or at least , almost so .
austen#"What say you , Marianne ?"" "" I shall very soon think him handsome , Elinor , if I do not now . When you tell me to love him as a brother , I shall no more see imperfection in his face , than I now do in his heart ."" Elinor started at this declaration , and was sorry for the warmth she had been betrayed into , in speaking of him . She felt that Edward stood very high in her opinion . She believed the regard to be mutual ; but she required greater certainty of it to make Marianne ' s conviction of their attachment agreeable to her ."
austen#"She knew that what Marianne and her mother conjectured one moment , they believed the next -- that with them , to wish was to hope , and to hope was to expect . She tried to explain the real state of the case to her sister . "" I do not attempt to deny ,"" said she , "" that I think very highly of him -- that I greatly esteem , that I like him ."" Marianne here burst forth with indignation -- "" Esteem him ! Like him !"
austen#"Cold - hearted Elinor ! Oh ! worse than cold - hearted ! Ashamed of being otherwise . Use those words again , and I will leave the room this moment ."" Elinor could not help laughing ."
austen#""" Excuse me ,"" said she ; "" and be assured that I meant no offence to you , by speaking , in so quiet a way , of my own feelings . Believe them to be stronger than I have declared ; believe them , in short , to be such as his merit , and the suspicion -- the hope of his affection for me may warrant , without imprudence or folly . But farther than this you must not believe . I am by no means assured of his regard for me . There are moments when the extent of it seems doubtful ; and till his sentiments are fully known , you cannot wonder at my wishing to avoid any encouragement of my own partiality , by believing or calling it more than it is . In my heart I feel little -- scarcely any doubt of his preference ."
austen#"But there are other points to be considered besides his inclination . He is very far from being independent . What his mother really is we cannot know ; but , from Fanny ' s occasional mention of her conduct and opinions , we have never been disposed to think her amiable ; and I am very much mistaken if Edward is not himself aware that there would be many difficulties in his way , if he were to wish to marry a woman who had not either a great fortune or high rank ."" Marianne was astonished to find how much the imagination of her mother and herself had outstripped the truth . "" And you really are not engaged to him !"" said she ."
austen#""" Yet it certainly soon will happen . But two advantages will proceed from this delay . I shall not lose you so soon , and Edward will have greater opportunity of improving that natural taste for your favourite pursuit which must be so indispensably necessary to your future felicity . Oh ! if he should be so far stimulated by your genius as to learn to draw himself , how delightful it would be !"" Elinor had given her real opinion to her sister ."
austen#She could not consider her partiality for Edward in so prosperous a state as Marianne had believed it . There was , at times , a want of spirits about him which , if it did not denote indifference , spoke of something almost as unpromising . A doubt of her regard , supposing him to feel it , need not give him more than inquietude . It would not be likely to produce that dejection of mind which frequently attended him . A more reasonable cause might be found in the dependent situation which forbade the indulgence of his affection . She knew that his mother neither behaved to him so as to make his home comfortable at present , nor to give him any assurance that he might form a home for himself , without strictly attending to her views for his aggrandizement .
austen#With such a knowledge as this , it was impossible for Elinor to feel easy on the subject . She was far from depending on that result of his preference of her , which her mother and sister still considered as certain . Nay , the longer they were together the more doubtful seemed the nature of his regard ; and sometimes , for a few painful minutes , she believed it to be no more than friendship . But , whatever might really be its limits , it was enough , when perceived by his sister , to make her uneasy , and at the same time , ( which was still more common ,) to make her uncivil . She took the first opportunity of affronting her mother - in - law on the occasion , talking to her so expressively of her brother ' s great expectations , of Mrs . Ferrars ' s resolution that both her sons should marry well , and of the danger attending any young woman who attempted to DRAW HIM IN ; that Mrs . Dashwood could neither pretend to be unconscious , nor endeavor to be calm . She gave her an answer which marked her contempt , and instantly left the room , resolving that , whatever might be the inconvenience or expense of so sudden a removal , her beloved Elinor should not be exposed another week to such insinuations .
austen#In this state of her spirits , a letter was delivered to her from the post , which contained a proposal particularly well timed . It was the offer of a small house , on very easy terms , belonging to a relation of her own , a gentleman of consequence and property in Devonshire . The letter was from this gentleman himself , and written in the true spirit of friendly accommodation . He understood that she was in need of a dwelling ; and though the house he now offered her was merely a cottage , he assured her that everything should be done to it which she might think necessary , if the situation pleased her . He earnestly pressed her , after giving the particulars of the house and garden , to come with her daughters to Barton Park , the place of his own residence , from whence she might judge , herself , whether Barton Cottage , for the houses were in the same parish , could , by any alteration , be made comfortable to her . He seemed really anxious to accommodate them and the whole of his letter was written in so friendly a style as could not fail of giving pleasure to his cousin ; more especially at a moment when she was suffering under the cold and unfeeling behaviour of her nearer connections .
austen#She needed no time for deliberation or inquiry . Her resolution was formed as she read . The situation of Barton , in a county so far distant from Sussex as Devonshire , which , but a few hours before , would have been a sufficient objection to outweigh every possible advantage belonging to the place , was now its first recommendation . To quit the neighbourhood of Norland was no longer an evil ; it was an object of desire ; it was a blessing , in comparison of the misery of continuing her daughter - in - law ' s guest ; and to remove for ever from that beloved place would be less painful than to inhabit or visit it while such a woman was its mistress . She instantly wrote Sir John Middleton her acknowledgment of his kindness , and her acceptance of his proposal ; and then hastened to shew both letters to her daughters , that she might be secure of their approbation before her answer were sent . Elinor had always thought it would be more prudent for them to settle at some distance from Norland , than immediately amongst their present acquaintance .
austen#On THAT head , therefore , it was not for her to oppose her mother ' s intention of removing into Devonshire . The house , too , as described by Sir John , was on so simple a scale , and the rent so uncommonly moderate , as to leave her no right of objection on either point ; and , therefore , though it was not a plan which brought any charm to her fancy , though it was a removal from the vicinity of Norland beyond her wishes , she made no attempt to dissuade her mother from sending a letter of acquiescence . CHAPTER 5 No sooner was her answer dispatched , than Mrs . Dashwood indulged herself in the pleasure of announcing to her son - in - law and his wife that she was provided with a house , and should incommode them no longer than till every thing were ready for her inhabiting it . They heard her with surprise . Mrs . John Dashwood said nothing ; but her husband civilly hoped that she would not be settled far from Norland .
austen#"She had great satisfaction in replying that she was going into Devonshire .-- Edward turned hastily towards her , on hearing this , and , in a voice of surprise and concern , which required no explanation to her , repeated , "" Devonshire ! Are you , indeed , going there ? So far from hence ! And to what part of it ?"" She explained the situation . It was within four miles northward of Exeter ."
austen#""" It is but a cottage ,"" she continued , "" but I hope to see many of my friends in it . A room or two can easily be added ; and if my friends find no difficulty in travelling so far to see me , I am sure I will find none in accommodating them ."" She concluded with a very kind invitation to Mr . and Mrs . John Dashwood to visit her at Barton ; and to Edward she gave one with still greater affection . Though her late conversation with her daughter - in - law had made her resolve on remaining at Norland no longer than was unavoidable , it had not produced the smallest effect on her in that point to which it principally tended . To separate Edward and Elinor was as far from being her object as ever ; and she wished to show Mrs . John Dashwood , by this pointed invitation to her brother , how totally she disregarded her disapprobation of the match . Mr . John Dashwood told his mother again and again how exceedingly sorry he was that she had taken a house at such a distance from Norland as to prevent his being of any service to her in removing her furniture ."
austen#He really felt conscientiously vexed on the occasion ; for the very exertion to which he had limited the performance of his promise to his father was by this arrangement rendered impracticable .-- The furniture was all sent around by water . It chiefly consisted of household linen , plate , china , and books , with a handsome pianoforte of Marianne ' s . Mrs . John Dashwood saw the packages depart with a sigh : she could not help feeling it hard that as Mrs . Dashwood ' s income would be so trifling in comparison with their own , she should have any handsome article of furniture . Mrs . Dashwood took the house for a twelvemonth ; it was ready furnished , and she might have immediate possession . No difficulty arose on either side in the agreement ; and she waited only for the disposal of her effects at Norland , and to determine her future household , before she set off for the west ; and this , as she was exceedingly rapid in the performance of everything that interested her , was soon done .-- The horses which were left her by her husband had been sold soon after his death , and an opportunity now offering of disposing of her carriage , she agreed to sell that likewise at the earnest advice of her eldest daughter . For the comfort of her children , had she consulted only her own wishes , she would have kept it ; but the discretion of Elinor prevailed .
austen#HER wisdom too limited the number of their servants to three ; two maids and a man , with whom they were speedily provided from amongst those who had formed their establishment at Norland . The man and one of the maids were sent off immediately into Devonshire , to prepare the house for their mistress ' s arrival ; for as Lady Middleton was entirely unknown to Mrs . Dashwood , she preferred going directly to the cottage to being a visitor at Barton Park ; and she relied so undoubtingly on Sir John ' s description of the house , as to feel no curiosity to examine it herself till she entered it as her own . Her eagerness to be gone from Norland was preserved from diminution by the evident satisfaction of her daughter - in - law in the prospect of her removal ; a satisfaction which was but feebly attempted to be concealed under a cold invitation to her to defer her departure . Now was the time when her son - in - law ' s promise to his father might with particular propriety be fulfilled . Since he had neglected to do it on first coming to the estate , their quitting his house might be looked on as the most suitable period for its accomplishment . But Mrs . Dashwood began shortly to give over every hope of the kind , and to be convinced , from the general drift of his discourse , that his assistance extended no farther than their maintenance for six months at Norland .
austen#"He so frequently talked of the increasing expenses of housekeeping , and of the perpetual demands upon his purse , which a man of any consequence in the world was beyond calculation exposed to , that he seemed rather to stand in need of more money himself than to have any design of giving money away . In a very few weeks from the day which brought Sir John Middleton ' s first letter to Norland , every thing was so far settled in their future abode as to enable Mrs . Dashwood and her daughters to begin their journey . Many were the tears shed by them in their last adieus to a place so much beloved . "" Dear , dear Norland !"" said Marianne , as she wandered alone before the house , on the last evening of their being there ; "" when shall I cease to regret you !-- when learn to feel a home elsewhere !-- Oh ! happy house , could you know what I suffer in now viewing you from this spot , from whence perhaps I may view you no more !-- And you , ye well - known trees !-- but you will continue the same .-- No leaf will decay because we are removed , nor any branch become motionless although we can observe you no longer !-- No ; you will continue the same ; unconscious of the pleasure or the regret you occasion , and insensible of any change in those who walk under your shade !-- But who will remain to enjoy you ?"""
austen#CHAPTER 6 The first part of their journey was performed in too melancholy a disposition to be otherwise than tedious and unpleasant . But as they drew towards the end of it , their interest in the appearance of a country which they were to inhabit overcame their dejection , and a view of Barton Valley as they entered it gave them cheerfulness . It was a pleasant fertile spot , well wooded , and rich in pasture . After winding along it for more than a mile , they reached their own house . A small green court was the whole of its demesne in front ; and a neat wicket gate admitted them into it .
austen#As a house , Barton Cottage , though small , was comfortable and compact ; but as a cottage it was defective , for the building was regular , the roof was tiled , the window shutters were not painted green , nor were the walls covered with honeysuckles . A narrow passage led directly through the house into the garden behind . On each side of the entrance was a sitting room , about sixteen feet square ; and beyond them were the offices and the stairs . Four bed - rooms and two garrets formed the rest of the house . It had not been built many years and was in good repair . In comparison of Norland , it was poor and small indeed !-- but the tears which recollection called forth as they entered the house were soon dried away .
austen#They were cheered by the joy of the servants on their arrival , and each for the sake of the others resolved to appear happy . It was very early in September ; the season was fine , and from first seeing the place under the advantage of good weather , they received an impression in its favour which was of material service in recommending it to their lasting approbation . The situation of the house was good . High hills rose immediately behind , and at no great distance on each side ; some of which were open downs , the others cultivated and woody . The village of Barton was chiefly on one of these hills , and formed a pleasant view from the cottage windows . The prospect in front was more extensive ; it commanded the whole of the valley , and reached into the country beyond .
austen#"The hills which surrounded the cottage terminated the valley in that direction ; under another name , and in another course , it branched out again between two of the steepest of them . With the size and furniture of the house Mrs . Dashwood was upon the whole well satisfied ; for though her former style of life rendered many additions to the latter indispensable , yet to add and improve was a delight to her ; and she had at this time ready money enough to supply all that was wanted of greater elegance to the apartments . "" As for the house itself , to be sure ,"" said she , "" it is too small for our family , but we will make ourselves tolerably comfortable for the present , as it is too late in the year for improvements . Perhaps in the spring , if I have plenty of money , as I dare say I shall , we may think about building . These parlors are both too small for such parties of our friends as I hope to see often collected here ; and I have some thoughts of throwing the passage into one of them with perhaps a part of the other , and so leave the remainder of that other for an entrance ; this , with a new drawing room which may be easily added , and a bed - chamber and garret above , will make it a very snug little cottage . I could wish the stairs were handsome ."
austen#"But one must not expect every thing ; though I suppose it would be no difficult matter to widen them . I shall see how much I am before - hand with the world in the spring , and we will plan our improvements accordingly ."" In the mean time , till all these alterations could be made from the savings of an income of five hundred a - year by a woman who never saved in her life , they were wise enough to be contented with the house as it was ; and each of them was busy in arranging their particular concerns , and endeavoring , by placing around them books and other possessions , to form themselves a home . Marianne ' s pianoforte was unpacked and properly disposed of ; and Elinor ' s drawings were affixed to the walls of their sitting room . In such employments as these they were interrupted soon after breakfast the next day by the entrance of their landlord , who called to welcome them to Barton , and to offer them every accommodation from his own house and garden in which theirs might at present be deficient . Sir John Middleton was a good looking man about forty ."
austen#He had formerly visited at Stanhill , but it was too long for his young cousins to remember him . His countenance was thoroughly good - humoured ; and his manners were as friendly as the style of his letter . Their arrival seemed to afford him real satisfaction , and their comfort to be an object of real solicitude to him . He said much of his earnest desire of their living in the most sociable terms with his family , and pressed them so cordially to dine at Barton Park every day till they were better settled at home , that , though his entreaties were carried to a point of perseverance beyond civility , they could not give offence . His kindness was not confined to words ; for within an hour after he left them , a large basket full of garden stuff and fruit arrived from the park , which was followed before the end of the day by a present of game . He insisted , moreover , on conveying all their letters to and from the post for them , and would not be denied the satisfaction of sending them his newspaper every day .
austen#Lady Middleton had sent a very civil message by him , denoting her intention of waiting on Mrs . Dashwood as soon as she could be assured that her visit would be no inconvenience ; and as this message was answered by an invitation equally polite , her ladyship was introduced to them the next day . They were , of course , very anxious to see a person on whom so much of their comfort at Barton must depend ; and the elegance of her appearance was favourable to their wishes . Lady Middleton was not more than six or seven and twenty ; her face was handsome , her figure tall and striking , and her address graceful . Her manners had all the elegance which her husband ' s wanted . But they would have been improved by some share of his frankness and warmth ; and her visit was long enough to detract something from their first admiration , by shewing that , though perfectly well - bred , she was reserved , cold , and had nothing to say for herself beyond the most common - place inquiry or remark . Conversation however was not wanted , for Sir John was very chatty , and Lady Middleton had taken the wise precaution of bringing with her their eldest child , a fine little boy about six years old , by which means there was one subject always to be recurred to by the ladies in case of extremity , for they had to enquire his name and age , admire his beauty , and ask him questions which his mother answered for him , while he hung about her and held down his head , to the great surprise of her ladyship , who wondered at his being so shy before company , as he could make noise enough at home .
austen#On every formal visit a child ought to be of the party , by way of provision for discourse . In the present case it took up ten minutes to determine whether the boy were most like his father or mother , and in what particular he resembled either , for of course every body differed , and every body was astonished at the opinion of the others . An opportunity was soon to be given to the Dashwoods of debating on the rest of the children , as Sir John would not leave the house without securing their promise of dining at the park the next day . CHAPTER 7 Barton Park was about half a mile from the cottage . The ladies had passed near it in their way along the valley , but it was screened from their view at home by the projection of a hill .
austen#The house was large and handsome ; and the Middletons lived in a style of equal hospitality and elegance . The former was for Sir John ' s gratification , the latter for that of his lady . They were scarcely ever without some friends staying with them in the house , and they kept more company of every kind than any other family in the neighbourhood . It was necessary to the happiness of both ; for however dissimilar in temper and outward behaviour , they strongly resembled each other in that total want of talent and taste which confined their employments , unconnected with such as society produced , within a very narrow compass . Sir John was a sportsman , Lady Middleton a mother . He hunted and shot , and she humoured her children ; and these were their only resources .
austen#Lady Middleton had the advantage of being able to spoil her children all the year round , while Sir John ' s independent employments were in existence only half the time . Continual engagements at home and abroad , however , supplied all the deficiencies of nature and education ; supported the good spirits of Sir John , and gave exercise to the good breeding of his wife . Lady Middleton piqued herself upon the elegance of her table , and of all her domestic arrangements ; and from this kind of vanity was her greatest enjoyment in any of their parties . But Sir John ' s satisfaction in society was much more real ; he delighted in collecting about him more young people than his house would hold , and the noisier they were the better was he pleased . He was a blessing to all the juvenile part of the neighbourhood , for in summer he was for ever forming parties to eat cold ham and chicken out of doors , and in winter his private balls were numerous enough for any young lady who was not suffering under the unsatiable appetite of fifteen . The arrival of a new family in the country was always a matter of joy to him , and in every point of view he was charmed with the inhabitants he had now procured for his cottage at Barton .
austen#The Miss Dashwoods were young , pretty , and unaffected . It was enough to secure his good opinion ; for to be unaffected was all that a pretty girl could want to make her mind as captivating as her person . The friendliness of his disposition made him happy in accommodating those , whose situation might be considered , in comparison with the past , as unfortunate . In showing kindness to his cousins therefore he had the real satisfaction of a good heart ; and in settling a family of females only in his cottage , he had all the satisfaction of a sportsman ; for a sportsman , though he esteems only those of his sex who are sportsmen likewise , is not often desirous of encouraging their taste by admitting them to a residence within his own manor . Mrs . Dashwood and her daughters were met at the door of the house by Sir John , who welcomed them to Barton Park with unaffected sincerity ; and as he attended them to the drawing room repeated to the young ladies the concern which the same subject had drawn from him the day before , at being unable to get any smart young men to meet them . They would see , he said , only one gentleman there besides himself ; a particular friend who was staying at the park , but who was neither very young nor very gay .
austen#He hoped they would all excuse the smallness of the party , and could assure them it should never happen so again . He had been to several families that morning in hopes of procuring some addition to their number , but it was moonlight and every body was full of engagements . Luckily Lady Middleton ' s mother had arrived at Barton within the last hour , and as she was a very cheerful agreeable woman , he hoped the young ladies would not find it so very dull as they might imagine . The young ladies , as well as their mother , were perfectly satisfied with having two entire strangers of the party , and wished for no more . Mrs . Jennings , Lady Middleton ' s mother , was a good - humoured , merry , fat , elderly woman , who talked a great deal , seemed very happy , and rather vulgar . She was full of jokes and laughter , and before dinner was over had said many witty things on the subject of lovers and husbands ; hoped they had not left their hearts behind them in Sussex , and pretended to see them blush whether they did or not .
austen#Marianne was vexed at it for her sister ' s sake , and turned her eyes towards Elinor to see how she bore these attacks , with an earnestness which gave Elinor far more pain than could arise from such common - place raillery as Mrs . Jennings ' s . Colonel Brandon , the friend of Sir John , seemed no more adapted by resemblance of manner to be his friend , than Lady Middleton was to be his wife , or Mrs . Jennings to be Lady Middleton ' s mother . He was silent and grave . His appearance however was not unpleasing , in spite of his being in the opinion of Marianne and Margaret an absolute old bachelor , for he was on the wrong side of five and thirty ; but though his face was not handsome , his countenance was sensible , and his address was particularly gentlemanlike . There was nothing in any of the party which could recommend them as companions to the Dashwoods ; but the cold insipidity of Lady Middleton was so particularly repulsive , that in comparison of it the gravity of Colonel Brandon , and even the boisterous mirth of Sir John and his mother - in - law was interesting . Lady Middleton seemed to be roused to enjoyment only by the entrance of her four noisy children after dinner , who pulled her about , tore her clothes , and put an end to every kind of discourse except what related to themselves .
austen#In the evening , as Marianne was discovered to be musical , she was invited to play . The instrument was unlocked , every body prepared to be charmed , and Marianne , who sang very well , at their request went through the chief of the songs which Lady Middleton had brought into the family on her marriage , and which perhaps had lain ever since in the same position on the pianoforte , for her ladyship had celebrated that event by giving up music , although by her mother ' s account , she had played extremely well , and by her own was very fond of it . Marianne ' s performance was highly applauded . Sir John was loud in his admiration at the end of every song , and as loud in his conversation with the others while every song lasted . Lady Middleton frequently called him to order , wondered how any one ' s attention could be diverted from music for a moment , and asked Marianne to sing a particular song which Marianne had just finished . Colonel Brandon alone , of all the party , heard her without being in raptures .
austen#He paid her only the compliment of attention ; and she felt a respect for him on the occasion , which the others had reasonably forfeited by their shameless want of taste . His pleasure in music , though it amounted not to that ecstatic delight which alone could sympathize with her own , was estimable when contrasted against the horrible insensibility of the others ; and she was reasonable enough to allow that a man of five and thirty might well have outlived all acuteness of feeling and every exquisite power of enjoyment . She was perfectly disposed to make every allowance for the colonel ' s advanced state of life which humanity required . CHAPTER 8 Mrs . Jennings was a widow with an ample jointure . She had only two daughters , both of whom she had lived to see respectably married , and she had now therefore nothing to do but to marry all the rest of the world .
austen#In the promotion of this object she was zealously active , as far as her ability reached ; and missed no opportunity of projecting weddings among all the young people of her acquaintance . She was remarkably quick in the discovery of attachments , and had enjoyed the advantage of raising the blushes and the vanity of many a young lady by insinuations of her power over such a young man ; and this kind of discernment enabled her soon after her arrival at Barton decisively to pronounce that Colonel Brandon was very much in love with Marianne Dashwood . She rather suspected it to be so , on the very first evening of their being together , from his listening so attentively while she sang to them ; and when the visit was returned by the Middletons ' dining at the cottage , the fact was ascertained by his listening to her again . It must be so . She was perfectly convinced of it . It would be an excellent match , for HE was rich , and SHE was handsome .
austen#"Mrs . Jennings had been anxious to see Colonel Brandon well married , ever since her connection with Sir John first brought him to her knowledge ; and she was always anxious to get a good husband for every pretty girl . The immediate advantage to herself was by no means inconsiderable , for it supplied her with endless jokes against them both . At the park she laughed at the colonel , and in the cottage at Marianne . To the former her raillery was probably , as far as it regarded only himself , perfectly indifferent ; but to the latter it was at first incomprehensible ; and when its object was understood , she hardly knew whether most to laugh at its absurdity , or censure its impertinence , for she considered it as an unfeeling reflection on the colonel ' s advanced years , and on his forlorn condition as an old bachelor . Mrs . Dashwood , who could not think a man five years younger than herself , so exceedingly ancient as he appeared to the youthful fancy of her daughter , ventured to clear Mrs . Jennings from the probability of wishing to throw ridicule on his age . "" But at least , Mamma , you cannot deny the absurdity of the accusation , though you may not think it intentionally ill - natured ."
austen#"Colonel Brandon is certainly younger than Mrs . Jennings , but he is old enough to be MY father ; and if he were ever animated enough to be in love , must have long outlived every sensation of the kind . It is too ridiculous ! When is a man to be safe from such wit , if age and infirmity will not protect him ?"" "" Infirmity !"" said Elinor , "" do you call Colonel Brandon infirm ? I can easily suppose that his age may appear much greater to you than to my mother ; but you can hardly deceive yourself as to his having the use of his limbs !"""
austen#""" Did not you hear him complain of the rheumatism ? and is not that the commonest infirmity of declining life ?"" "" My dearest child ,"" said her mother , laughing , "" at this rate you must be in continual terror of MY decay ; and it must seem to you a miracle that my life has been extended to the advanced age of forty ."" "" Mamma , you are not doing me justice . I know very well that Colonel Brandon is not old enough to make his friends yet apprehensive of losing him in the course of nature . He may live twenty years longer ."
austen#"But thirty - five has nothing to do with matrimony ."" "" Perhaps ,"" said Elinor , "" thirty - five and seventeen had better not have any thing to do with matrimony together . But if there should by any chance happen to be a woman who is single at seven and twenty , I should not think Colonel Brandon ' s being thirty - five any objection to his marrying HER ."" "" A woman of seven and twenty ,"" said Marianne , after pausing a moment , "" can never hope to feel or inspire affection again , and if her home be uncomfortable , or her fortune small , I can suppose that she might bring herself to submit to the offices of a nurse , for the sake of the provision and security of a wife . In his marrying such a woman therefore there would be nothing unsuitable . It would be a compact of convenience , and the world would be satisfied ."
austen#"In my eyes it would be no marriage at all , but that would be nothing . To me it would seem only a commercial exchange , in which each wished to be benefited at the expense of the other ."" "" It would be impossible , I know ,"" replied Elinor , "" to convince you that a woman of seven and twenty could feel for a man of thirty - five anything near enough to love , to make him a desirable companion to her . But I must object to your dooming Colonel Brandon and his wife to the constant confinement of a sick chamber , merely because he chanced to complain yesterday ( a very cold damp day ) of a slight rheumatic feel in one of his shoulders ."" "" But he talked of flannel waistcoats ,"" said Marianne ; "" and with me a flannel waistcoat is invariably connected with aches , cramps , rheumatisms , and every species of ailment that can afflict the old and the feeble ."" "" Had he been only in a violent fever , you would not have despised him half so much ."
austen#"Confess , Marianne , is not there something interesting to you in the flushed cheek , hollow eye , and quick pulse of a fever ?"" Soon after this , upon Elinor ' s leaving the room , "" Mamma ,"" said Marianne , "" I have an alarm on the subject of illness which I cannot conceal from you . I am sure Edward Ferrars is not well . We have now been here almost a fortnight , and yet he does not come . Nothing but real indisposition could occasion this extraordinary delay . What else can detain him at Norland ?"""
austen#""" Had you any idea of his coming so soon ?"" said Mrs . Dashwood . "" I had none . On the contrary , if I have felt any anxiety at all on the subject , it has been in recollecting that he sometimes showed a want of pleasure and readiness in accepting my invitation , when I talked of his coming to Barton . Does Elinor expect him already ?"" "" I have never mentioned it to her , but of course she must ."""
austen#""" I rather think you are mistaken , for when I was talking to her yesterday of getting a new grate for the spare bedchamber , she observed that there was no immediate hurry for it , as it was not likely that the room would be wanted for some time ."" "" How strange this is ! what can be the meaning of it ! But the whole of their behaviour to each other has been unaccountable ! How cold , how composed were their last adieus ! How languid their conversation the last evening of their being together !"
austen#"In Edward ' s farewell there was no distinction between Elinor and me : it was the good wishes of an affectionate brother to both . Twice did I leave them purposely together in the course of the last morning , and each time did he most unaccountably follow me out of the room . And Elinor , in quitting Norland and Edward , cried not as I did . Even now her self - command is invariable . When is she dejected or melancholy ? When does she try to avoid society , or appear restless and dissatisfied in it ?"""
austen#CHAPTER 9 The Dashwoods were now settled at Barton with tolerable comfort to themselves . The house and the garden , with all the objects surrounding them , were now become familiar , and the ordinary pursuits which had given to Norland half its charms were engaged in again with far greater enjoyment than Norland had been able to afford , since the loss of their father . Sir John Middleton , who called on them every day for the first fortnight , and who was not in the habit of seeing much occupation at home , could not conceal his amazement on finding them always employed . Their visitors , except those from Barton Park , were not many ; for , in spite of Sir John ' s urgent entreaties that they would mix more in the neighbourhood , and repeated assurances of his carriage being always at their service , the independence of Mrs . Dashwood ' s spirit overcame the wish of society for her children ; and she was resolute in declining to visit any family beyond the distance of a walk . There were but few who could be so classed ; and it was not all of them that were attainable .
austen#About a mile and a half from the cottage , along the narrow winding valley of Allenham , which issued from that of Barton , as formerly described , the girls had , in one of their earliest walks , discovered an ancient respectable looking mansion which , by reminding them a little of Norland , interested their imagination and made them wish to be better acquainted with it . But they learnt , on enquiry , that its possessor , an elderly lady of very good character , was unfortunately too infirm to mix with the world , and never stirred from home . The whole country about them abounded in beautiful walks . The high downs which invited them from almost every window of the cottage to seek the exquisite enjoyment of air on their summits , were a happy alternative when the dirt of the valleys beneath shut up their superior beauties ; and towards one of these hills did Marianne and Margaret one memorable morning direct their steps , attracted by the partial sunshine of a showery sky , and unable longer to bear the confinement which the settled rain of the two preceding days had occasioned . The weather was not tempting enough to draw the two others from their pencil and their book , in spite of Marianne ' s declaration that the day would be lastingly fair , and that every threatening cloud would be drawn off from their hills ; and the two girls set off together . They gaily ascended the downs , rejoicing in their own penetration at every glimpse of blue sky ; and when they caught in their faces the animating gales of a high south - westerly wind , they pitied the fears which had prevented their mother and Elinor from sharing such delightful sensations .
austen#""" Is there a felicity in the world ,"" said Marianne , "" superior to this ?-- Margaret , we will walk here at least two hours ."" Margaret agreed , and they pursued their way against the wind , resisting it with laughing delight for about twenty minutes longer , when suddenly the clouds united over their heads , and a driving rain set full in their face .-- Chagrined and surprised , they were obliged , though unwillingly , to turn back , for no shelter was nearer than their own house . One consolation however remained for them , to which the exigence of the moment gave more than usual propriety ; it was that of running with all possible speed down the steep side of the hill which led immediately to their garden gate . They set off . Marianne had at first the advantage , but a false step brought her suddenly to the ground ; and Margaret , unable to stop herself to assist her , was involuntarily hurried along , and reached the bottom in safety . A gentleman carrying a gun , with two pointers playing round him , was passing up the hill and within a few yards of Marianne , when her accident happened ."
austen#He put down his gun and ran to her assistance . She had raised herself from the ground , but her foot had been twisted in her fall , and she was scarcely able to stand . The gentleman offered his services ; and perceiving that her modesty declined what her situation rendered necessary , took her up in his arms without farther delay , and carried her down the hill . Then passing through the garden , the gate of which had been left open by Margaret , he bore her directly into the house , whither Margaret was just arrived , and quitted not his hold till he had seated her in a chair in the parlour . Elinor and her mother rose up in amazement at their entrance , and while the eyes of both were fixed on him with an evident wonder and a secret admiration which equally sprung from his appearance , he apologized for his intrusion by relating its cause , in a manner so frank and so graceful that his person , which was uncommonly handsome , received additional charms from his voice and expression . Had he been even old , ugly , and vulgar , the gratitude and kindness of Mrs . Dashwood would have been secured by any act of attention to her child ; but the influence of youth , beauty , and elegance , gave an interest to the action which came home to her feelings .
austen#She thanked him again and again ; and , with a sweetness of address which always attended her , invited him to be seated . But this he declined , as he was dirty and wet . Mrs . Dashwood then begged to know to whom she was obliged . His name , he replied , was Willoughby , and his present home was at Allenham , from whence he hoped she would allow him the honour of calling tomorrow to enquire after Miss Dashwood . The honour was readily granted , and he then departed , to make himself still more interesting , in the midst of a heavy rain . His manly beauty and more than common gracefulness were instantly the theme of general admiration , and the laugh which his gallantry raised against Marianne received particular spirit from his exterior attractions .-- Marianne herself had seen less of his person that the rest , for the confusion which crimsoned over her face , on his lifting her up , had robbed her of the power of regarding him after their entering the house .
austen#But she had seen enough of him to join in all the admiration of the others , and with an energy which always adorned her praise . His person and air were equal to what her fancy had ever drawn for the hero of a favourite story ; and in his carrying her into the house with so little previous formality , there was a rapidity of thought which particularly recommended the action to her . Every circumstance belonging to him was interesting . His name was good , his residence was in their favourite village , and she soon found out that of all manly dresses a shooting - jacket was the most becoming . Her imagination was busy , her reflections were pleasant , and the pain of a sprained ankle was disregarded . Sir John called on them as soon as the next interval of fair weather that morning allowed him to get out of doors ; and Marianne ' s accident being related to him , he was eagerly asked whether he knew any gentleman of the name of Willoughby at Allenham .
austen#""" Willoughby !"" cried Sir John ; "" what , is HE in the country ? That is good news however ; I will ride over tomorrow , and ask him to dinner on Thursday ."" "" You know him then ,"" said Mrs . Dashwood . "" Know him ! to be sure I do ."
austen#"Why , he is down here every year ."" "" And what sort of a young man is he ?"" "" As good a kind of fellow as ever lived , I assure you . A very decent shot , and there is not a bolder rider in England ."" "" And is that all you can say for him ?"" cried Marianne , indignantly ."
austen#""" But what are his manners on more intimate acquaintance ? What his pursuits , his talents , and genius ?"" Sir John was rather puzzled . "" Upon my soul ,"" said he , "" I do not know much about him as to all THAT . But he is a pleasant , good humoured fellow , and has got the nicest little black bitch of a pointer I ever saw . Was she out with him today ?"""
austen#"But Marianne could no more satisfy him as to the colour of Mr . Willoughby ' s pointer , than he could describe to her the shades of his mind . "" But who is he ?"" said Elinor . "" Where does he come from ? Has he a house at Allenham ?"" On this point Sir John could give more certain intelligence ; and he told them that Mr . Willoughby had no property of his own in the country ; that he resided there only while he was visiting the old lady at Allenham Court , to whom he was related , and whose possessions he was to inherit ; adding , "" Yes , yes , he is very well worth catching I can tell you , Miss Dashwood ; he has a pretty little estate of his own in Somersetshire besides ; and if I were you , I would not give him up to my younger sister , in spite of all this tumbling down hills ."
austen#"Miss Marianne must not expect to have all the men to herself . Brandon will be jealous , if she does not take care ."" "" I do not believe ,"" said Mrs . Dashwood , with a good humoured smile , "" that Mr . Willoughby will be incommoded by the attempts of either of MY daughters towards what you call CATCHING him . It is not an employment to which they have been brought up . Men are very safe with us , let them be ever so rich . I am glad to find , however , from what you say , that he is a respectable young man , and one whose acquaintance will not be ineligible ."""
austen#""" He is as good a sort of fellow , I believe , as ever lived ,"" repeated Sir John . "" I remember last Christmas at a little hop at the park , he danced from eight o ' clock till four , without once sitting down ."" "" Did he indeed ?"" cried Marianne with sparkling eyes , "" and with elegance , with spirit ?"" "" Yes ; and he was up again at eight to ride to covert ."" "" That is what I like ; that is what a young man ought to be ."
austen#"Whatever be his pursuits , his eagerness in them should know no moderation , and leave him no sense of fatigue ."" "" Aye , aye , I see how it will be ,"" said Sir John , "" I see how it will be . You will be setting your cap at him now , and never think of poor Brandon ."" "" That is an expression , Sir John ,"" said Marianne , warmly , "" which I particularly dislike . I abhor every common - place phrase by which wit is intended ; and ' setting one ' s cap at a man ,' or ' making a conquest ,' are the most odious of all . Their tendency is gross and illiberal ; and if their construction could ever be deemed clever , time has long ago destroyed all its ingenuity ."""
austen#"Sir John did not much understand this reproof ; but he laughed as heartily as if he did , and then replied , "" Ay , you will make conquests enough , I dare say , one way or other . Poor Brandon ! he is quite smitten already , and he is very well worth setting your cap at , I can tell you , in spite of all this tumbling about and spraining of ankles ."" CHAPTER 10 Marianne ' s preserver , as Margaret , with more elegance than precision , styled Willoughby , called at the cottage early the next morning to make his personal enquiries ."
austen#He was received by Mrs . Dashwood with more than politeness ; with a kindness which Sir John ' s account of him and her own gratitude prompted ; and every thing that passed during the visit tended to assure him of the sense , elegance , mutual affection , and domestic comfort of the family to whom accident had now introduced him . Of their personal charms he had not required a second interview to be convinced . Miss Dashwood had a delicate complexion , regular features , and a remarkably pretty figure . Marianne was still handsomer . Her form , though not so correct as her sister ' s , in having the advantage of height , was more striking ; and her face was so lovely , that when in the common cant of praise , she was called a beautiful girl , truth was less violently outraged than usually happens . Her skin was very brown , but , from its transparency , her complexion was uncommonly brilliant ; her features were all good ; her smile was sweet and attractive ; and in her eyes , which were very dark , there was a life , a spirit , an eagerness , which could hardily be seen without delight .
austen#From Willoughby their expression was at first held back , by the embarrassment which the remembrance of his assistance created . But when this passed away , when her spirits became collected , when she saw that to the perfect good - breeding of the gentleman , he united frankness and vivacity , and above all , when she heard him declare , that of music and dancing he was passionately fond , she gave him such a look of approbation as secured the largest share of his discourse to herself for the rest of his stay . It was only necessary to mention any favourite amusement to engage her to talk . She could not be silent when such points were introduced , and she had neither shyness nor reserve in their discussion . They speedily discovered that their enjoyment of dancing and music was mutual , and that it arose from a general conformity of judgment in all that related to either . Encouraged by this to a further examination of his opinions , she proceeded to question him on the subject of books ; her favourite authors were brought forward and dwelt upon with so rapturous a delight , that any young man of five and twenty must have been insensible indeed , not to become an immediate convert to the excellence of such works , however disregarded before .
austen#"Their taste was strikingly alike . The same books , the same passages were idolized by each -- or if any difference appeared , any objection arose , it lasted no longer than till the force of her arguments and the brightness of her eyes could be displayed . He acquiesced in all her decisions , caught all her enthusiasm ; and long before his visit concluded , they conversed with the familiarity of a long - established acquaintance . "" Well , Marianne ,"" said Elinor , as soon as he had left them , "" for ONE morning I think you have done pretty well . You have already ascertained Mr . Willoughby ' s opinion in almost every matter of importance . You know what he thinks of Cowper and Scott ; you are certain of his estimating their beauties as he ought , and you have received every assurance of his admiring Pope no more than is proper ."
austen#"But how is your acquaintance to be long supported , under such extraordinary despatch of every subject for discourse ? You will soon have exhausted each favourite topic . Another meeting will suffice to explain his sentiments on picturesque beauty , and second marriages , and then you can have nothing farther to ask ."" -- "" Elinor ,"" cried Marianne , "" is this fair ? is this just ?"
austen#"are my ideas so scanty ? But I see what you mean . I have been too much at my ease , too happy , too frank . I have erred against every common - place notion of decorum ; I have been open and sincere where I ought to have been reserved , spiritless , dull , and deceitful -- had I talked only of the weather and the roads , and had I spoken only once in ten minutes , this reproach would have been spared ."" "" My love ,"" said her mother , "" you must not be offended with Elinor -- she was only in jest . I should scold her myself , if she were capable of wishing to check the delight of your conversation with our new friend ."""
austen#-- Marianne was softened in a moment . Willoughby , on his side , gave every proof of his pleasure in their acquaintance , which an evident wish of improving it could offer . He came to them every day . To enquire after Marianne was at first his excuse ; but the encouragement of his reception , to which every day gave greater kindness , made such an excuse unnecessary before it had ceased to be possible , by Marianne ' s perfect recovery . She was confined for some days to the house ; but never had any confinement been less irksome . Willoughby was a young man of good abilities , quick imagination , lively spirits , and open , affectionate manners .
austen#He was exactly formed to engage Marianne ' s heart , for with all this , he joined not only a captivating person , but a natural ardour of mind which was now roused and increased by the example of her own , and which recommended him to her affection beyond every thing else . His society became gradually her most exquisite enjoyment . They read , they talked , they sang together ; his musical talents were considerable ; and he read with all the sensibility and spirit which Edward had unfortunately wanted . In Mrs . Dashwood ' s estimation he was as faultless as in Marianne ' s ; and Elinor saw nothing to censure in him but a propensity , in which he strongly resembled and peculiarly delighted her sister , of saying too much what he thought on every occasion , without attention to persons or circumstances . In hastily forming and giving his opinion of other people , in sacrificing general politeness to the enjoyment of undivided attention where his heart was engaged , and in slighting too easily the forms of worldly propriety , he displayed a want of caution which Elinor could not approve , in spite of all that he and Marianne could say in its support . Marianne began now to perceive that the desperation which had seized her at sixteen and a half , of ever seeing a man who could satisfy her ideas of perfection , had been rash and unjustifiable .
austen#Willoughby was all that her fancy had delineated in that unhappy hour and in every brighter period , as capable of attaching her ; and his behaviour declared his wishes to be in that respect as earnest , as his abilities were strong . Her mother too , in whose mind not one speculative thought of their marriage had been raised , by his prospect of riches , was led before the end of a week to hope and expect it ; and secretly to congratulate herself on having gained two such sons - in - law as Edward and Willoughby . Colonel Brandon ' s partiality for Marianne , which had so early been discovered by his friends , now first became perceptible to Elinor , when it ceased to be noticed by them . Their attention and wit were drawn off to his more fortunate rival ; and the raillery which the other had incurred before any partiality arose , was removed when his feelings began really to call for the ridicule so justly annexed to sensibility . Elinor was obliged , though unwillingly , to believe that the sentiments which Mrs . Jennings had assigned him for her own satisfaction , were now actually excited by her sister ; and that however a general resemblance of disposition between the parties might forward the affection of Mr . Willoughby , an equally striking opposition of character was no hindrance to the regard of Colonel Brandon . She saw it with concern ; for what could a silent man of five and thirty hope , when opposed to a very lively one of five and twenty ?
austen#"and as she could not even wish him successful , she heartily wished him indifferent . She liked him -- in spite of his gravity and reserve , she beheld in him an object of interest . His manners , though serious , were mild ; and his reserve appeared rather the result of some oppression of spirits than of any natural gloominess of temper . Sir John had dropped hints of past injuries and disappointments , which justified her belief of his being an unfortunate man , and she regarded him with respect and compassion . Perhaps she pitied and esteemed him the more because he was slighted by Willoughby and Marianne , who , prejudiced against him for being neither lively nor young , seemed resolved to undervalue his merits . "" Brandon is just the kind of man ,"" said Willoughby one day , when they were talking of him together , "" whom every body speaks well of , and nobody cares about ; whom all are delighted to see , and nobody remembers to talk to ."""
austen#""" That is exactly what I think of him ,"" cried Marianne . "" Do not boast of it , however ,"" said Elinor , "" for it is injustice in both of you . He is highly esteemed by all the family at the park , and I never see him myself without taking pains to converse with him ."" "" That he is patronised by YOU ,"" replied Willoughby , "" is certainly in his favour ; but as for the esteem of the others , it is a reproach in itself . Who would submit to the indignity of being approved by such a woman as Lady Middleton and Mrs . Jennings , that could command the indifference of any body else ?"" "" But perhaps the abuse of such people as yourself and Marianne will make amends for the regard of Lady Middleton and her mother ."
austen#"If their praise is censure , your censure may be praise , for they are not more undiscerning , than you are prejudiced and unjust ."" "" In defence of your protege you can even be saucy ."" "" My protege , as you call him , is a sensible man ; and sense will always have attractions for me . Yes , Marianne , even in a man between thirty and forty . He has seen a great deal of the world ; has been abroad , has read , and has a thinking mind . I have found him capable of giving me much information on various subjects ; and he has always answered my inquiries with readiness of good - breeding and good nature ."""
austen#""" That is to say ,"" cried Marianne contemptuously , "" he has told you , that in the East Indies the climate is hot , and the mosquitoes are troublesome ."" "" He WOULD have told me so , I doubt not , had I made any such inquiries , but they happened to be points on which I had been previously informed ."" "" Perhaps ,"" said Willoughby , "" his observations may have extended to the existence of nabobs , gold mohrs , and palanquins ."" "" I may venture to say that HIS observations have stretched much further than your candour . But why should you dislike him ?"" "" I do not dislike him ."
austen#"I consider him , on the contrary , as a very respectable man , who has every body ' s good word , and nobody ' s notice ; who , has more money than he can spend , more time than he knows how to employ , and two new coats every year ."" "" Add to which ,"" cried Marianne , "" that he has neither genius , taste , nor spirit . That his understanding has no brilliancy , his feelings no ardour , and his voice no expression ."" "" You decide on his imperfections so much in the mass ,"" replied Elinor , "" and so much on the strength of your own imagination , that the commendation I am able to give of him is comparatively cold and insipid . I can only pronounce him to be a sensible man , well - bred , well - informed , of gentle address , and , I believe , possessing an amiable heart ."" "" Miss Dashwood ,"" cried Willoughby , "" you are now using me unkindly ."
austen#"You are endeavouring to disarm me by reason , and to convince me against my will . But it will not do . You shall find me as stubborn as you can be artful . I have three unanswerable reasons for disliking Colonel Brandon ; he threatened me with rain when I wanted it to be fine ; he has found fault with the hanging of my curricle , and I cannot persuade him to buy my brown mare . If it will be any satisfaction to you , however , to be told , that I believe his character to be in other respects irreproachable , I am ready to confess it . And in return for an acknowledgment , which must give me some pain , you cannot deny me the privilege of disliking him as much as ever ."""
austen#CHAPTER 11 Little had Mrs . Dashwood or her daughters imagined when they first came into Devonshire , that so many engagements would arise to occupy their time as shortly presented themselves , or that they should have such frequent invitations and such constant visitors as to leave them little leisure for serious employment . Yet such was the case . When Marianne was recovered , the schemes of amusement at home and abroad , which Sir John had been previously forming , were put into execution . The private balls at the park then began ; and parties on the water were made and accomplished as often as a showery October would allow . In every meeting of the kind Willoughby was included ; and the ease and familiarity which naturally attended these parties were exactly calculated to give increasing intimacy to his acquaintance with the Dashwoods , to afford him opportunity of witnessing the excellencies of Marianne , of marking his animated admiration of her , and of receiving , in her behaviour to himself , the most pointed assurance of her affection .
austen#Elinor could not be surprised at their attachment . She only wished that it were less openly shewn ; and once or twice did venture to suggest the propriety of some self - command to Marianne . But Marianne abhorred all concealment where no real disgrace could attend unreserve ; and to aim at the restraint of sentiments which were not in themselves illaudable , appeared to her not merely an unnecessary effort , but a disgraceful subjection of reason to common - place and mistaken notions . Willoughby thought the same ; and their behaviour at all times , was an illustration of their opinions . When he was present she had no eyes for any one else . Every thing he did , was right .
austen#Every thing he said , was clever . If their evenings at the park were concluded with cards , he cheated himself and all the rest of the party to get her a good hand . If dancing formed the amusement of the night , they were partners for half the time ; and when obliged to separate for a couple of dances , were careful to stand together and scarcely spoke a word to any body else . Such conduct made them of course most exceedingly laughed at ; but ridicule could not shame , and seemed hardly to provoke them . Mrs . Dashwood entered into all their feelings with a warmth which left her no inclination for checking this excessive display of them . To her it was but the natural consequence of a strong affection in a young and ardent mind .
austen#This was the season of happiness to Marianne . Her heart was devoted to Willoughby , and the fond attachment to Norland , which she brought with her from Sussex , was more likely to be softened than she had thought it possible before , by the charms which his society bestowed on her present home . Elinor ' s happiness was not so great . Her heart was not so much at ease , nor her satisfaction in their amusements so pure . They afforded her no companion that could make amends for what she had left behind , nor that could teach her to think of Norland with less regret than ever . Neither Lady Middleton nor Mrs . Jennings could supply to her the conversation she missed ; although the latter was an everlasting talker , and from the first had regarded her with a kindness which ensured her a large share of her discourse .
austen#She had already repeated her own history to Elinor three or four times ; and had Elinor ' s memory been equal to her means of improvement , she might have known very early in their acquaintance all the particulars of Mr . Jenning ' s last illness , and what he said to his wife a few minutes before he died . Lady Middleton was more agreeable than her mother only in being more silent . Elinor needed little observation to perceive that her reserve was a mere calmness of manner with which sense had nothing to do . Towards her husband and mother she was the same as to them ; and intimacy was therefore neither to be looked for nor desired . She had nothing to say one day that she had not said the day before . Her insipidity was invariable , for even her spirits were always the same ; and though she did not oppose the parties arranged by her husband , provided every thing were conducted in style and her two eldest children attended her , she never appeared to receive more enjoyment from them than she might have experienced in sitting at home ;-- and so little did her presence add to the pleasure of the others , by any share in their conversation , that they were sometimes only reminded of her being amongst them by her solicitude about her troublesome boys .
austen#In Colonel Brandon alone , of all her new acquaintance , did Elinor find a person who could in any degree claim the respect of abilities , excite the interest of friendship , or give pleasure as a companion . Willoughby was out of the question . Her admiration and regard , even her sisterly regard , was all his own ; but he was a lover ; his attentions were wholly Marianne ' s , and a far less agreeable man might have been more generally pleasing . Colonel Brandon , unfortunately for himself , had no such encouragement to think only of Marianne , and in conversing with Elinor he found the greatest consolation for the indifference of her sister . Elinor ' s compassion for him increased , as she had reason to suspect that the misery of disappointed love had already been known to him . This suspicion was given by some words which accidently dropped from him one evening at the park , when they were sitting down together by mutual consent , while the others were dancing .
austen#"His eyes were fixed on Marianne , and , after a silence of some minutes , he said , with a faint smile , "" Your sister , I understand , does not approve of second attachments ."" "" No ,"" replied Elinor , "" her opinions are all romantic ."" "" Or rather , as I believe , she considers them impossible to exist ."" "" I believe she does . But how she contrives it without reflecting on the character of her own father , who had himself two wives , I know not . A few years however will settle her opinions on the reasonable basis of common sense and observation ; and then they may be more easy to define and to justify than they now are , by any body but herself ."""
austen#""" This will probably be the case ,"" he replied ; "" and yet there is something so amiable in the prejudices of a young mind , that one is sorry to see them give way to the reception of more general opinions ."" "" I cannot agree with you there ,"" said Elinor . "" There are inconveniences attending such feelings as Marianne ' s , which all the charms of enthusiasm and ignorance of the world cannot atone for . Her systems have all the unfortunate tendency of setting propriety at nought ; and a better acquaintance with the world is what I look forward to as her greatest possible advantage ."" After a short pause he resumed the conversation by saying ,-- "" Does your sister make no distinction in her objections against a second attachment ?"
austen#"or is it equally criminal in every body ? Are those who have been disappointed in their first choice , whether from the inconstancy of its object , or the perverseness of circumstances , to be equally indifferent during the rest of their lives ?"" "" Upon my word , I am not acquainted with the minutiae of her principles . I only know that I never yet heard her admit any instance of a second attachment ' s being pardonable ."" "" This ,"" said he , "" cannot hold ; but a change , a total change of sentiments -- No , no , do not desire it ; for when the romantic refinements of a young mind are obliged to give way , how frequently are they succeeded by such opinions as are but too common , and too dangerous ! I speak from experience ."
austen#"I once knew a lady who in temper and mind greatly resembled your sister , who thought and judged like her , but who from an inforced change -- from a series of unfortunate circumstances ""-- Here he stopt suddenly ; appeared to think that he had said too much , and by his countenance gave rise to conjectures , which might not otherwise have entered Elinor ' s head . The lady would probably have passed without suspicion , had he not convinced Miss Dashwood that what concerned her ought not to escape his lips . As it was , it required but a slight effort of fancy to connect his emotion with the tender recollection of past regard . Elinor attempted no more . But Marianne , in her place , would not have done so little . The whole story would have been speedily formed under her active imagination ; and every thing established in the most melancholy order of disastrous love ."
austen#"CHAPTER 12 As Elinor and Marianne were walking together the next morning the latter communicated a piece of news to her sister , which in spite of all that she knew before of Marianne ' s imprudence and want of thought , surprised her by its extravagant testimony of both . Marianne told her , with the greatest delight , that Willoughby had given her a horse , one that he had bred himself on his estate in Somersetshire , and which was exactly calculated to carry a woman . Without considering that it was not in her mother ' s plan to keep any horse , that if she were to alter her resolution in favour of this gift , she must buy another for the servant , and keep a servant to ride it , and after all , build a stable to receive them , she had accepted the present without hesitation , and told her sister of it in raptures . "" He intends to send his groom into Somersetshire immediately for it ,"" she added , "" and when it arrives we will ride every day . You shall share its use with me ."
austen#"Imagine to yourself , my dear Elinor , the delight of a gallop on some of these downs ."" Most unwilling was she to awaken from such a dream of felicity to comprehend all the unhappy truths which attended the affair ; and for some time she refused to submit to them . As to an additional servant , the expense would be a trifle ; Mamma she was sure would never object to it ; and any horse would do for HIM ; he might always get one at the park ; as to a stable , the merest shed would be sufficient . Elinor then ventured to doubt the propriety of her receiving such a present from a man so little , or at least so lately known to her . This was too much . "" You are mistaken , Elinor ,"" said she warmly , "" in supposing I know very little of Willoughby ."
austen#"I have not known him long indeed , but I am much better acquainted with him , than I am with any other creature in the world , except yourself and mama . It is not time or opportunity that is to determine intimacy ;-- it is disposition alone . Seven years would be insufficient to make some people acquainted with each other , and seven days are more than enough for others . I should hold myself guilty of greater impropriety in accepting a horse from my brother , than from Willoughby . Of John I know very little , though we have lived together for years ; but of Willoughby my judgment has long been formed ."" Elinor thought it wisest to touch that point no more ."
austen#"She knew her sister ' s temper . Opposition on so tender a subject would only attach her the more to her own opinion . But by an appeal to her affection for her mother , by representing the inconveniences which that indulgent mother must draw on herself , if ( as would probably be the case ) she consented to this increase of establishment , Marianne was shortly subdued ; and she promised not to tempt her mother to such imprudent kindness by mentioning the offer , and to tell Willoughby when she saw him next , that it must be declined . She was faithful to her word ; and when Willoughby called at the cottage , the same day , Elinor heard her express her disappointment to him in a low voice , on being obliged to forego the acceptance of his present . The reasons for this alteration were at the same time related , and they were such as to make further entreaty on his side impossible . His concern however was very apparent ; and after expressing it with earnestness , he added , in the same low voice ,--"" But , Marianne , the horse is still yours , though you cannot use it now ."
austen#"I shall keep it only till you can claim it . When you leave Barton to form your own establishment in a more lasting home , Queen Mab shall receive you ."" This was all overheard by Miss Dashwood ; and in the whole of the sentence , in his manner of pronouncing it , and in his addressing her sister by her Christian name alone , she instantly saw an intimacy so decided , a meaning so direct , as marked a perfect agreement between them . From that moment she doubted not of their being engaged to each other ; and the belief of it created no other surprise than that she , or any of their friends , should be left by tempers so frank , to discover it by accident . Margaret related something to her the next day , which placed this matter in a still clearer light . Willoughby had spent the preceding evening with them , and Margaret , by being left some time in the parlour with only him and Marianne , had had opportunity for observations , which , with a most important face , she communicated to her eldest sister , when they were next by themselves ."
austen#""" Oh , Elinor !"" she cried , "" I have such a secret to tell you about Marianne . I am sure she will be married to Mr . Willoughby very soon ."" "" You have said so ,"" replied Elinor , "" almost every day since they first met on High - church Down ; and they had not known each other a week , I believe , before you were certain that Marianne wore his picture round her neck ; but it turned out to be only the miniature of our great uncle ."" "" But indeed this is quite another thing . I am sure they will be married very soon , for he has got a lock of her hair ."""
austen#""" Take care , Margaret . It may be only the hair of some great uncle of HIS ."" "" But , indeed , Elinor , it is Marianne ' s . I am almost sure it is , for I saw him cut it off . Last night after tea , when you and mama went out of the room , they were whispering and talking together as fast as could be , and he seemed to be begging something of her , and presently he took up her scissors and cut off a long lock of her hair , for it was all tumbled down her back ; and he kissed it , and folded it up in a piece of white paper ; and put it into his pocket - book ."" For such particulars , stated on such authority , Elinor could not withhold her credit ; nor was she disposed to it , for the circumstance was in perfect unison with what she had heard and seen herself ."
austen#"Margaret ' s sagacity was not always displayed in a way so satisfactory to her sister . When Mrs . Jennings attacked her one evening at the park , to give the name of the young man who was Elinor ' s particular favourite , which had been long a matter of great curiosity to her , Margaret answered by looking at her sister , and saying , "" I must not tell , may I , Elinor ?"" This of course made every body laugh ; and Elinor tried to laugh too . But the effort was painful . She was convinced that Margaret had fixed on a person whose name she could not bear with composure to become a standing joke with Mrs . Jennings . Marianne felt for her most sincerely ; but she did more harm than good to the cause , by turning very red and saying in an angry manner to Margaret ,"
austen#""" Remember that whatever your conjectures may be , you have no right to repeat them ."" "" I never had any conjectures about it ,"" replied Margaret ; "" it was you who told me of it yourself ."" This increased the mirth of the company , and Margaret was eagerly pressed to say something more . "" Oh ! pray , Miss Margaret , let us know all about it ,"" said Mrs . Jennings . "" What is the gentleman ' s name ?"""
austen#""" I must not tell , ma ' am . But I know very well what it is ; and I know where he is too ."" "" Yes , yes , we can guess where he is ; at his own house at Norland to be sure . He is the curate of the parish I dare say ."" "" No , THAT he is not . He is of no profession at all ."""
austen#""" Margaret ,"" said Marianne with great warmth , "" you know that all this is an invention of your own , and that there is no such person in existence ."" "" Well , then , he is lately dead , Marianne , for I am sure there was such a man once , and his name begins with an F ."" Most grateful did Elinor feel to Lady Middleton for observing , at this moment , "" that it rained very hard ,"" though she believed the interruption to proceed less from any attention to her , than from her ladyship ' s great dislike of all such inelegant subjects of raillery as delighted her husband and mother . The idea however started by her , was immediately pursued by Colonel Brandon , who was on every occasion mindful of the feelings of others ; and much was said on the subject of rain by both of them . Willoughby opened the piano - forte , and asked Marianne to sit down to it ; and thus amidst the various endeavours of different people to quit the topic , it fell to the ground . But not so easily did Elinor recover from the alarm into which it had thrown her ."
austen#A party was formed this evening for going on the following day to see a very fine place about twelve miles from Barton , belonging to a brother - in - law of Colonel Brandon , without whose interest it could not be seen , as the proprietor , who was then abroad , had left strict orders on that head . The grounds were declared to be highly beautiful , and Sir John , who was particularly warm in their praise , might be allowed to be a tolerable judge , for he had formed parties to visit them , at least , twice every summer for the last ten years . They contained a noble piece of water ; a sail on which was to a form a great part of the morning ' s amusement ; cold provisions were to be taken , open carriages only to be employed , and every thing conducted in the usual style of a complete party of pleasure . To some few of the company it appeared rather a bold undertaking , considering the time of year , and that it had rained every day for the last fortnight ;-- and Mrs . Dashwood , who had already a cold , was persuaded by Elinor to stay at home . CHAPTER 13 Their intended excursion to Whitwell turned out very different from what Elinor had expected .
austen#She was prepared to be wet through , fatigued , and frightened ; but the event was still more unfortunate , for they did not go at all . By ten o ' clock the whole party was assembled at the park , where they were to breakfast . The morning was rather favourable , though it had rained all night , as the clouds were then dispersing across the sky , and the sun frequently appeared . They were all in high spirits and good humour , eager to be happy , and determined to submit to the greatest inconveniences and hardships rather than be otherwise . While they were at breakfast the letters were brought in . Among the rest there was one for Colonel Brandon ;-- he took it , looked at the direction , changed colour , and immediately left the room .
austen#""" What is the matter with Brandon ?"" said Sir John . Nobody could tell . "" I hope he has had no bad news ,"" said Lady Middleton . "" It must be something extraordinary that could make Colonel Brandon leave my breakfast table so suddenly ."" In about five minutes he returned ."
austen#""" No bad news , Colonel , I hope ;"" said Mrs . Jennings , as soon as he entered the room . "" None at all , ma ' am , I thank you ."" "" Was it from Avignon ? I hope it is not to say that your sister is worse ."" "" No , ma ' am . It came from town , and is merely a letter of business ."""
austen#""" But how came the hand to discompose you so much , if it was only a letter of business ? Come , come , this won ' t do , Colonel ; so let us hear the truth of it ."" "" My dear madam ,"" said Lady Middleton , "" recollect what you are saying ."" "" Perhaps it is to tell you that your cousin Fanny is married ?"" said Mrs . Jennings , without attending to her daughter ' s reproof . "" No , indeed , it is not ."""
austen#""" Well , then , I know who it is from , Colonel . And I hope she is well ."" "" Whom do you mean , ma ' am ?"" said he , colouring a little . "" Oh ! you know who I mean ."""
austen#""" I am particularly sorry , ma ' am ,"" said he , addressing Lady Middleton , "" that I should receive this letter today , for it is on business which requires my immediate attendance in town ."" "" In town !"" cried Mrs . Jennings . "" What can you have to do in town at this time of year ?"" "" My own loss is great ,"" be continued , "" in being obliged to leave so agreeable a party ; but I am the more concerned , as I fear my presence is necessary to gain your admittance at Whitwell ."" What a blow upon them all was this !"
austen#""" But if you write a note to the housekeeper , Mr . Brandon ,"" said Marianne , eagerly , "" will it not be sufficient ?"" He shook his head . "" We must go ,"" said Sir John .--"" It shall not be put off when we are so near it . You cannot go to town till tomorrow , Brandon , that is all ."" "" I wish it could be so easily settled . But it is not in my power to delay my journey for one day !"""
austen#""" If you would but let us know what your business is ,"" said Mrs . Jennings , "" we might see whether it could be put off or not ."" "" You would not be six hours later ,"" said Willoughby , "" if you were to defer your journey till our return ."" "" I cannot afford to lose ONE hour ."" -- Elinor then heard Willoughby say , in a low voice to Marianne , "" There are some people who cannot bear a party of pleasure . Brandon is one of them ."
austen#"He was afraid of catching cold I dare say , and invented this trick for getting out of it . I would lay fifty guineas the letter was of his own writing ."" "" I have no doubt of it ,"" replied Marianne . "" There is no persuading you to change your mind , Brandon , I know of old ,"" said Sir John , "" when once you are determined on anything . But , however , I hope you will think better of it . Consider , here are the two Miss Careys come over from Newton , the three Miss Dashwoods walked up from the cottage , and Mr . Willoughby got up two hours before his usual time , on purpose to go to Whitwell ."""
austen#"Colonel Brandon again repeated his sorrow at being the cause of disappointing the party ; but at the same time declared it to be unavoidable . "" Well , then , when will you come back again ?"" "" I hope we shall see you at Barton ,"" added her ladyship , "" as soon as you can conveniently leave town ; and we must put off the party to Whitwell till you return ."" "" You are very obliging . But it is so uncertain , when I may have it in my power to return , that I dare not engage for it at all ."" "" Oh !"
austen#"he must and shall come back ,"" cried Sir John . "" If he is not here by the end of the week , I shall go after him ."" "" Ay , so do , Sir John ,"" cried Mrs . Jennings , "" and then perhaps you may find out what his business is ."" "" I do not want to pry into other men ' s concerns . I suppose it is something he is ashamed of ."" Colonel Brandon ' s horses were announced ."
austen#""" You do not go to town on horseback , do you ?"" added Sir John . "" No . Only to Honiton . I shall then go post ."" "" Well , as you are resolved to go , I wish you a good journey ."
austen#"But you had better change your mind ."" "" I assure you it is not in my power ."" He then took leave of the whole party . "" Is there no chance of my seeing you and your sisters in town this winter , Miss Dashwood ?"" "" I am afraid , none at all ."" "" Then I must bid you farewell for a longer time than I should wish to do ."""
austen#"To Marianne , he merely bowed and said nothing . "" Come Colonel ,"" said Mrs . Jennings , "" before you go , do let us know what you are going about ."" He wished her a good morning , and , attended by Sir John , left the room . The complaints and lamentations which politeness had hitherto restrained , now burst forth universally ; and they all agreed again and again how provoking it was to be so disappointed . "" I can guess what his business is , however ,"" said Mrs . Jennings exultingly . "" Can you , ma ' am ?"""
austen#"said almost every body . "" Yes ; it is about Miss Williams , I am sure ."" "" And who is Miss Williams ?"" asked Marianne . "" What ! do not you know who Miss Williams is ?"
austen#"I am sure you must have heard of her before . She is a relation of the Colonel ' s , my dear ; a very near relation . We will not say how near , for fear of shocking the young ladies ."" Then , lowering her voice a little , she said to Elinor , "" She is his natural daughter ."" "" Indeed !"" "" Oh , yes ; and as like him as she can stare ."
austen#"I dare say the Colonel will leave her all his fortune ."" When Sir John returned , he joined most heartily in the general regret on so unfortunate an event ; concluding however by observing , that as they were all got together , they must do something by way of being happy ; and after some consultation it was agreed , that although happiness could only be enjoyed at Whitwell , they might procure a tolerable composure of mind by driving about the country . The carriages were then ordered ; Willoughby ' s was first , and Marianne never looked happier than when she got into it . He drove through the park very fast , and they were soon out of sight ; and nothing more of them was seen till their return , which did not happen till after the return of all the rest . They both seemed delighted with their drive ; but said only in general terms that they had kept in the lanes , while the others went on the downs . It was settled that there should be a dance in the evening , and that every body should be extremely merry all day long ."
austen#"Some more of the Careys came to dinner , and they had the pleasure of sitting down nearly twenty to table , which Sir John observed with great contentment . Willoughby took his usual place between the two elder Miss Dashwoods . Mrs . Jennings sat on Elinor ' s right hand ; and they had not been long seated , before she leant behind her and Willoughby , and said to Marianne , loud enough for them both to hear , "" I have found you out in spite of all your tricks . I know where you spent the morning ."" Marianne coloured , and replied very hastily , "" Where , pray ?"" --"
austen#""" Did not you know ,"" said Willoughby , "" that we had been out in my curricle ?"" "" Yes , yes , Mr . Impudence , I know that very well , and I was determined to find out WHERE you had been to .-- I hope you like your house , Miss Marianne . It is a very large one , I know ; and when I come to see you , I hope you will have new - furnished it , for it wanted it very much when I was there six years ago ."" Marianne turned away in great confusion . Mrs . Jennings laughed heartily ; and Elinor found that in her resolution to know where they had been , she had actually made her own woman enquire of Mr . Willoughby ' s groom ; and that she had by that method been informed that they had gone to Allenham , and spent a considerable time there in walking about the garden and going all over the house . Elinor could hardly believe this to be true , as it seemed very unlikely that Willoughby should propose , or Marianne consent , to enter the house while Mrs . Smith was in it , with whom Marianne had not the smallest acquaintance ."
austen#"As soon as they left the dining - room , Elinor enquired of her about it ; and great was her surprise when she found that every circumstance related by Mrs . Jennings was perfectly true . Marianne was quite angry with her for doubting it . "" Why should you imagine , Elinor , that we did not go there , or that we did not see the house ? Is not it what you have often wished to do yourself ?"" "" Yes , Marianne , but I would not go while Mrs . Smith was there , and with no other companion than Mr . Willoughby ."""
austen#""" Mr . Willoughby however is the only person who can have a right to shew that house ; and as he went in an open carriage , it was impossible to have any other companion . I never spent a pleasanter morning in my life ."" "" I am afraid ,"" replied Elinor , "" that the pleasantness of an employment does not always evince its propriety ."" "" On the contrary , nothing can be a stronger proof of it , Elinor ; for if there had been any real impropriety in what I did , I should have been sensible of it at the time , for we always know when we are acting wrong , and with such a conviction I could have had no pleasure ."" "" But , my dear Marianne , as it has already exposed you to some very impertinent remarks , do you not now begin to doubt the discretion of your own conduct ?"" "" If the impertinent remarks of Mrs . Jennings are to be the proof of impropriety in conduct , we are all offending every moment of our lives ."
austen#"I value not her censure any more than I should do her commendation . I am not sensible of having done anything wrong in walking over Mrs . Smith ' s grounds , or in seeing her house . They will one day be Mr . Willoughby ' s , and --"" "" If they were one day to be your own , Marianne , you would not be justified in what you have done ."" She blushed at this hint ; but it was even visibly gratifying to her ; and after a ten minutes ' interval of earnest thought , she came to her sister again , and said with great good humour , "" Perhaps , Elinor , it WAS rather ill - judged in me to go to Allenham ; but Mr . Willoughby wanted particularly to shew me the place ; and it is a charming house , I assure you .-- There is one remarkably pretty sitting room up stairs ; of a nice comfortable size for constant use , and with modern furniture it would be delightful . It is a corner room , and has windows on two sides ."
austen#"On one side you look across the bowling - green , behind the house , to a beautiful hanging wood , and on the other you have a view of the church and village , and , beyond them , of those fine bold hills that we have so often admired . I did not see it to advantage , for nothing could be more forlorn than the furniture ,-- but if it were newly fitted up -- a couple of hundred pounds , Willoughby says , would make it one of the pleasantest summer - rooms in England ."" Could Elinor have listened to her without interruption from the others , she would have described every room in the house with equal delight . CHAPTER 14 The sudden termination of Colonel Brandon ' s visit at the park , with his steadiness in concealing its cause , filled the mind , and raised the wonder of Mrs . Jennings for two or three days ; she was a great wonderer , as every one must be who takes a very lively interest in all the comings and goings of all their acquaintance . She wondered , with little intermission what could be the reason of it ; was sure there must be some bad news , and thought over every kind of distress that could have befallen him , with a fixed determination that he should not escape them all ."
austen#""" Something very melancholy must be the matter , I am sure ,"" said she . "" I could see it in his face . Poor man ! I am afraid his circumstances may be bad . The estate at Delaford was never reckoned more than two thousand a year , and his brother left everything sadly involved . I do think he must have been sent for about money matters , for what else can it be ?"
austen#I wonder whether it is so . I would give anything to know the truth of it . Perhaps it is about Miss Williams and , by the bye , I dare say it is , because he looked so conscious when I mentioned her . May be she is ill in town ; nothing in the world more likely , for I have a notion she is always rather sickly . I would lay any wager it is about Miss Williams . It is not so very likely he should be distressed in his circumstances NOW , for he is a very prudent man , and to be sure must have cleared the estate by this time .
austen#"I wonder what it can be ! May be his sister is worse at Avignon , and has sent for him over . His setting off in such a hurry seems very like it . Well , I wish him out of all his trouble with all my heart , and a good wife into the bargain ."" So wondered , so talked Mrs . Jennings . Her opinion varying with every fresh conjecture , and all seeming equally probable as they arose ."
austen#Elinor , though she felt really interested in the welfare of Colonel Brandon , could not bestow all the wonder on his going so suddenly away , which Mrs . Jennings was desirous of her feeling ; for besides that the circumstance did not in her opinion justify such lasting amazement or variety of speculation , her wonder was otherwise disposed of . It was engrossed by the extraordinary silence of her sister and Willoughby on the subject , which they must know to be peculiarly interesting to them all . As this silence continued , every day made it appear more strange and more incompatible with the disposition of both . Why they should not openly acknowledge to her mother and herself , what their constant behaviour to each other declared to have taken place , Elinor could not imagine . She could easily conceive that marriage might not be immediately in their power ; for though Willoughby was independent , there was no reason to believe him rich . His estate had been rated by Sir John at about six or seven hundred a year ; but he lived at an expense to which that income could hardly be equal , and he had himself often complained of his poverty .
austen#"But for this strange kind of secrecy maintained by them relative to their engagement , which in fact concealed nothing at all , she could not account ; and it was so wholly contradictory to their general opinions and practice , that a doubt sometimes entered her mind of their being really engaged , and this doubt was enough to prevent her making any inquiry of Marianne . Nothing could be more expressive of attachment to them all , than Willoughby ' s behaviour . To Marianne it had all the distinguishing tenderness which a lover ' s heart could give , and to the rest of the family it was the affectionate attention of a son and a brother . The cottage seemed to be considered and loved by him as his home ; many more of his hours were spent there than at Allenham ; and if no general engagement collected them at the park , the exercise which called him out in the morning was almost certain of ending there , where the rest of the day was spent by himself at the side of Marianne , and by his favourite pointer at her feet . One evening in particular , about a week after Colonel Brandon left the country , his heart seemed more than usually open to every feeling of attachment to the objects around him ; and on Mrs . Dashwood ' s happening to mention her design of improving the cottage in the spring , he warmly opposed every alteration of a place which affection had established as perfect with him . "" What !"""
austen#"he exclaimed --"" Improve this dear cottage ! No . THAT I will never consent to . Not a stone must be added to its walls , not an inch to its size , if my feelings are regarded ."" "" Do not be alarmed ,"" said Miss Dashwood , "" nothing of the kind will be done ; for my mother will never have money enough to attempt it ."" "" I am heartily glad of it ,"" he cried ."
austen#""" May she always be poor , if she can employ her riches no better ."" "" Thank you , Willoughby . But you may be assured that I would not sacrifice one sentiment of local attachment of yours , or of any one whom I loved , for all the improvements in the world . Depend upon it that whatever unemployed sum may remain , when I make up my accounts in the spring , I would even rather lay it uselessly by than dispose of it in a manner so painful to you . But are you really so attached to this place as to see no defect in it ?"" "" I am ,"" said he ."
austen#""" To me it is faultless . Nay , more , I consider it as the only form of building in which happiness is attainable , and were I rich enough I would instantly pull Combe down , and build it up again in the exact plan of this cottage ."" "" With dark narrow stairs and a kitchen that smokes , I suppose ,"" said Elinor . "" Yes ,"" cried he in the same eager tone , "" with all and every thing belonging to it ;-- in no one convenience or INconvenience about it , should the least variation be perceptible . Then , and then only , under such a roof , I might perhaps be as happy at Combe as I have been at Barton ."" "" I flatter myself ,"" replied Elinor , "" that even under the disadvantage of better rooms and a broader staircase , you will hereafter find your own house as faultless as you now do this ."""
austen#""" There certainly are circumstances ,"" said Willoughby , "" which might greatly endear it to me ; but this place will always have one claim of my affection , which no other can possibly share ."" Mrs . Dashwood looked with pleasure at Marianne , whose fine eyes were fixed so expressively on Willoughby , as plainly denoted how well she understood him . "" How often did I wish ,"" added he , "" when I was at Allenham this time twelvemonth , that Barton cottage were inhabited ! I never passed within view of it without admiring its situation , and grieving that no one should live in it . How little did I then think that the very first news I should hear from Mrs . Smith , when I next came into the country , would be that Barton cottage was taken : and I felt an immediate satisfaction and interest in the event , which nothing but a kind of prescience of what happiness I should experience from it , can account for . Must it not have been so , Marianne ?"""
austen#"speaking to her in a lowered voice . Then continuing his former tone , he said , "" And yet this house you would spoil , Mrs . Dashwood ? You would rob it of its simplicity by imaginary improvement ! and this dear parlour in which our acquaintance first began , and in which so many happy hours have been since spent by us together , you would degrade to the condition of a common entrance , and every body would be eager to pass through the room which has hitherto contained within itself more real accommodation and comfort than any other apartment of the handsomest dimensions in the world could possibly afford ."" Mrs . Dashwood again assured him that no alteration of the kind should be attempted . "" You are a good woman ,"" he warmly replied ."
austen#""" Your promise makes me easy . Extend it a little farther , and it will make me happy . Tell me that not only your house will remain the same , but that I shall ever find you and yours as unchanged as your dwelling ; and that you will always consider me with the kindness which has made everything belonging to you so dear to me ."" The promise was readily given , and Willoughby ' s behaviour during the whole of the evening declared at once his affection and happiness . "" Shall we see you tomorrow to dinner ?"" said Mrs . Dashwood , when he was leaving them ."
austen#""" I do not ask you to come in the morning , for we must walk to the park , to call on Lady Middleton ."" He engaged to be with them by four o ' clock . CHAPTER 15 Mrs . Dashwood ' s visit to Lady Middleton took place the next day , and two of her daughters went with her ; but Marianne excused herself from being of the party , under some trifling pretext of employment ; and her mother , who concluded that a promise had been made by Willoughby the night before of calling on her while they were absent , was perfectly satisfied with her remaining at home . On their return from the park they found Willoughby ' s curricle and servant in waiting at the cottage , and Mrs . Dashwood was convinced that her conjecture had been just . So far it was all as she had foreseen ; but on entering the house she beheld what no foresight had taught her to expect ."
austen#"They were no sooner in the passage than Marianne came hastily out of the parlour apparently in violent affliction , with her handkerchief at her eyes ; and without noticing them ran up stairs . Surprised and alarmed they proceeded directly into the room she had just quitted , where they found only Willoughby , who was leaning against the mantel - piece with his back towards them . He turned round on their coming in , and his countenance shewed that he strongly partook of the emotion which over - powered Marianne . "" Is anything the matter with her ?"" cried Mrs . Dashwood as she entered --"" is she ill ?"" "" I hope not ,"" he replied , trying to look cheerful ; and with a forced smile presently added , "" It is I who may rather expect to be ill -- for I am now suffering under a very heavy disappointment !"""
austen#""" Disappointment ?"" "" Yes , for I am unable to keep my engagement with you . Mrs . Smith has this morning exercised the privilege of riches upon a poor dependent cousin , by sending me on business to London . I have just received my dispatches , and taken my farewell of Allenham ; and by way of exhilaration I am now come to take my farewell of you ."" "" To London !-- and are you going this morning ?"" "" Almost this moment ."""
austen#""" This is very unfortunate . But Mrs . Smith must be obliged ;-- and her business will not detain you from us long I hope ."" He coloured as he replied , "" You are very kind , but I have no idea of returning into Devonshire immediately . My visits to Mrs . Smith are never repeated within the twelvemonth ."" "" And is Mrs . Smith your only friend ? Is Allenham the only house in the neighbourhood to which you will be welcome ?"
austen#"For shame , Willoughby , can you wait for an invitation here ?"" His colour increased ; and with his eyes fixed on the ground he only replied , "" You are too good ."" Mrs . Dashwood looked at Elinor with surprise . Elinor felt equal amazement . For a few moments every one was silent . Mrs . Dashwood first spoke ."
austen#""" I have only to add , my dear Willoughby , that at Barton cottage you will always be welcome ; for I will not press you to return here immediately , because you only can judge how far THAT might be pleasing to Mrs . Smith ; and on this head I shall be no more disposed to question your judgment than to doubt your inclination ."" "" My engagements at present ,"" replied Willoughby , confusedly , "" are of such a nature -- that -- I dare not flatter myself ""-- He stopt . Mrs . Dashwood was too much astonished to speak , and another pause succeeded . This was broken by Willoughby , who said with a faint smile , "" It is folly to linger in this manner . I will not torment myself any longer by remaining among friends whose society it is impossible for me now to enjoy ."""
austen#He then hastily took leave of them all and left the room . They saw him step into his carriage , and in a minute it was out of sight . Mrs . Dashwood felt too much for speech , and instantly quitted the parlour to give way in solitude to the concern and alarm which this sudden departure occasioned . Elinor ' s uneasiness was at least equal to her mother ' s . She thought of what had just passed with anxiety and distrust . Willoughby ' s behaviour in taking leave of them , his embarrassment , and affectation of cheerfulness , and , above all , his unwillingness to accept her mother ' s invitation , a backwardness so unlike a lover , so unlike himself , greatly disturbed her .
austen#"One moment she feared that no serious design had ever been formed on his side ; and the next that some unfortunate quarrel had taken place between him and her sister ;-- the distress in which Marianne had quitted the room was such as a serious quarrel could most reasonably account for , though when she considered what Marianne ' s love for him was , a quarrel seemed almost impossible . But whatever might be the particulars of their separation , her sister ' s affliction was indubitable ; and she thought with the tenderest compassion of that violent sorrow which Marianne was in all probability not merely giving way to as a relief , but feeding and encouraging as a duty . In about half an hour her mother returned , and though her eyes were red , her countenance was not uncheerful . "" Our dear Willoughby is now some miles from Barton , Elinor ,"" said she , as she sat down to work , "" and with how heavy a heart does he travel ?"" "" It is all very strange . So suddenly to be gone !"
austen#It seems but the work of a moment . And last night he was with us so happy , so cheerful , so affectionate ? And now , after only ten minutes notice -- Gone too without intending to return !-- Something more than what be owned to us must have happened . He did not speak , he did not behave like himself . YOU must have seen the difference as well as I . What can it be ?
austen#"Can they have quarrelled ? Why else should he have shewn such unwillingness to accept your invitation here ?"" -- "" It was not inclination that he wanted , Elinor ; I could plainly see THAT . He had not the power of accepting it . I have thought it all over I assure you , and I can perfectly account for every thing that at first seemed strange to me as well as to you ."""
austen#""" Can you , indeed !"" "" Yes . I have explained it to myself in the most satisfactory way ;-- but you , Elinor , who love to doubt where you can -- it will not satisfy YOU , I know ; but you shall not talk ME out of my trust in it . I am persuaded that Mrs . Smith suspects his regard for Marianne , disapproves of it , ( perhaps because she has other views for him ,) and on that account is eager to get him away ;-- and that the business which she sends him off to transact is invented as an excuse to dismiss him . This is what I believe to have happened . He is , moreover , aware that she DOES disapprove the connection , he dares not therefore at present confess to her his engagement with Marianne , and he feels himself obliged , from his dependent situation , to give into her schemes , and absent himself from Devonshire for a while ."
austen#"You will tell me , I know , that this may or may NOT have happened ; but I will listen to no cavil , unless you can point out any other method of understanding the affair as satisfactory at this . And now , Elinor , what have you to say ?"" "" Nothing , for you have anticipated my answer ."" "" Then you would have told me , that it might or might not have happened . Oh , Elinor , how incomprehensible are your feelings ! You had rather take evil upon credit than good ."
austen#You had rather look out for misery for Marianne , and guilt for poor Willoughby , than an apology for the latter . You are resolved to think him blameable , because he took leave of us with less affection than his usual behaviour has shewn . And is no allowance to be made for inadvertence , or for spirits depressed by recent disappointment ? Are no probabilities to be accepted , merely because they are not certainties ? Is nothing due to the man whom we have all such reason to love , and no reason in the world to think ill of ? To the possibility of motives unanswerable in themselves , though unavoidably secret for a while ?
austen#"And , after all , what is it you suspect him of ?"" "" I can hardly tell myself . But suspicion of something unpleasant is the inevitable consequence of such an alteration as we just witnessed in him . There is great truth , however , in what you have now urged of the allowances which ought to be made for him , and it is my wish to be candid in my judgment of every body . Willoughby may undoubtedly have very sufficient reasons for his conduct , and I will hope that he has . But it would have been more like Willoughby to acknowledge them at once ."
austen#"Secrecy may be advisable ; but still I cannot help wondering at its being practiced by him ."" "" Do not blame him , however , for departing from his character , where the deviation is necessary . But you really do admit the justice of what I have said in his defence ?-- I am happy -- and he is acquitted ."" "" Not entirely . It may be proper to conceal their engagement ( if they ARE engaged ) from Mrs . Smith -- and if that is the case , it must be highly expedient for Willoughby to be but little in Devonshire at present . But this is no excuse for their concealing it from us ."""
austen#""" Concealing it from us ! my dear child , do you accuse Willoughby and Marianne of concealment ? This is strange indeed , when your eyes have been reproaching them every day for incautiousness ."" "" I want no proof of their affection ,"" said Elinor ; "" but of their engagement I do ."" "" I am perfectly satisfied of both ."" "" Yet not a syllable has been said to you on the subject , by either of them ."""
austen#""" I have not wanted syllables where actions have spoken so plainly . Has not his behaviour to Marianne and to all of us , for at least the last fortnight , declared that he loved and considered her as his future wife , and that he felt for us the attachment of the nearest relation ? Have we not perfectly understood each other ? Has not my consent been daily asked by his looks , his manner , his attentive and affectionate respect ? My Elinor , is it possible to doubt their engagement ? How could such a thought occur to you ?"
austen#"How is it to be supposed that Willoughby , persuaded as he must be of your sister ' s love , should leave her , and leave her perhaps for months , without telling her of his affection ;-- that they should part without a mutual exchange of confidence ?"" "" I confess ,"" replied Elinor , "" that every circumstance except ONE is in favour of their engagement ; but that ONE is the total silence of both on the subject , and with me it almost outweighs every other ."" "" How strange this is ! You must think wretchedly indeed of Willoughby , if , after all that has openly passed between them , you can doubt the nature of the terms on which they are together . Has he been acting a part in his behaviour to your sister all this time ? Do you suppose him really indifferent to her ?"""
austen#""" No , I cannot think that . He must and does love her I am sure ."" "" But with a strange kind of tenderness , if he can leave her with such indifference , such carelessness of the future , as you attribute to him ."" "" You must remember , my dear mother , that I have never considered this matter as certain . I have had my doubts , I confess ; but they are fainter than they were , and they may soon be entirely done away . If we find they correspond , every fear of mine will be removed ."""
austen#""" A mighty concession indeed ! If you were to see them at the altar , you would suppose they were going to be married . Ungracious girl ! But I require no such proof . Nothing in my opinion has ever passed to justify doubt ; no secrecy has been attempted ; all has been uniformly open and unreserved . You cannot doubt your sister ' s wishes ."
austen#"It must be Willoughby therefore whom you suspect . But why ? Is he not a man of honour and feeling ? Has there been any inconsistency on his side to create alarm ? can he be deceitful ?"" "" I hope not , I believe not ,"" cried Elinor ."
austen#""" I love Willoughby , sincerely love him ; and suspicion of his integrity cannot be more painful to yourself than to me . It has been involuntary , and I will not encourage it . I was startled , I confess , by the alteration in his manners this morning ;-- he did not speak like himself , and did not return your kindness with any cordiality . But all this may be explained by such a situation of his affairs as you have supposed . He had just parted from my sister , had seen her leave him in the greatest affliction ; and if he felt obliged , from a fear of offending Mrs . Smith , to resist the temptation of returning here soon , and yet aware that by declining your invitation , by saying that he was going away for some time , he should seem to act an ungenerous , a suspicious part by our family , be might well be embarrassed and disturbed . In such a case , a plain and open avowal of his difficulties would have been more to his honour I think , as well as more consistent with his general character ;-- but I will not raise objections against any one ' s conduct on so illiberal a foundation , as a difference in judgment from myself , or a deviation from what I may think right and consistent ."""
austen#""" You speak very properly . Willoughby certainly does not deserve to be suspected . Though WE have not known him long , he is no stranger in this part of the world ; and who has ever spoken to his disadvantage ? Had he been in a situation to act independently and marry immediately , it might have been odd that he should leave us without acknowledging everything to me at once : but this is not the case . It is an engagement in some respects not prosperously begun , for their marriage must be at a very uncertain distance ; and even secrecy , as far as it can be observed , may now be very advisable ."" They were interrupted by the entrance of Margaret ; and Elinor was then at liberty to think over the representations of her mother , to acknowledge the probability of many , and hope for the justice of all ."
austen#They saw nothing of Marianne till dinner time , when she entered the room and took her place at the table without saying a word . Her eyes were red and swollen ; and it seemed as if her tears were even then restrained with difficulty . She avoided the looks of them all , could neither eat nor speak , and after some time , on her mother ' s silently pressing her hand with tender compassion , her small degree of fortitude was quite overcome , she burst into tears and left the room . This violent oppression of spirits continued the whole evening . She was without any power , because she was without any desire of command over herself . The slightest mention of anything relative to Willoughby overpowered her in an instant ; and though her family were most anxiously attentive to her comfort , it was impossible for them , if they spoke at all , to keep clear of every subject which her feelings connected with him .
austen#CHAPTER 16 Marianne would have thought herself very inexcusable had she been able to sleep at all the first night after parting from Willoughby . She would have been ashamed to look her family in the face the next morning , had she not risen from her bed in more need of repose than when she lay down in it . But the feelings which made such composure a disgrace , left her in no danger of incurring it . She was awake the whole night , and she wept the greatest part of it . She got up with a headache , was unable to talk , and unwilling to take any nourishment ; giving pain every moment to her mother and sisters , and forbidding all attempt at consolation from either .
austen#Her sensibility was potent enough ! When breakfast was over she walked out by herself , and wandered about the village of Allenham , indulging the recollection of past enjoyment and crying over the present reverse for the chief of the morning . The evening passed off in the equal indulgence of feeling . She played over every favourite song that she had been used to play to Willoughby , every air in which their voices had been oftenest joined , and sat at the instrument gazing on every line of music that he had written out for her , till her heart was so heavy that no farther sadness could be gained ; and this nourishment of grief was every day applied . She spent whole hours at the pianoforte alternately singing and crying ; her voice often totally suspended by her tears . In books too , as well as in music , she courted the misery which a contrast between the past and present was certain of giving .
austen#"She read nothing but what they had been used to read together . Such violence of affliction indeed could not be supported for ever ; it sunk within a few days into a calmer melancholy ; but these employments , to which she daily recurred , her solitary walks and silent meditations , still produced occasional effusions of sorrow as lively as ever . No letter from Willoughby came ; and none seemed expected by Marianne . Her mother was surprised , and Elinor again became uneasy . But Mrs . Dashwood could find explanations whenever she wanted them , which at least satisfied herself . "" Remember , Elinor ,"" said she , "" how very often Sir John fetches our letters himself from the post , and carries them to it ."
austen#"We have already agreed that secrecy may be necessary , and we must acknowledge that it could not be maintained if their correspondence were to pass through Sir John ' s hands ."" Elinor could not deny the truth of this , and she tried to find in it a motive sufficient for their silence . But there was one method so direct , so simple , and in her opinion so eligible of knowing the real state of the affair , and of instantly removing all mystery , that she could not help suggesting it to her mother . "" Why do you not ask Marianne at once ,"" said she , "" whether she is or she is not engaged to Willoughby ? From you , her mother , and so kind , so indulgent a mother , the question could not give offence . It would be the natural result of your affection for her ."
austen#"She used to be all unreserve , and to you more especially ."" "" I would not ask such a question for the world . Supposing it possible that they are not engaged , what distress would not such an enquiry inflict ! At any rate it would be most ungenerous . I should never deserve her confidence again , after forcing from her a confession of what is meant at present to be unacknowledged to any one . I know Marianne ' s heart : I know that she dearly loves me , and that I shall not be the last to whom the affair is made known , when circumstances make the revealment of it eligible ."
austen#"I would not attempt to force the confidence of any one ; of a child much less ; because a sense of duty would prevent the denial which her wishes might direct ."" Elinor thought this generosity overstrained , considering her sister ' s youth , and urged the matter farther , but in vain ; common sense , common care , common prudence , were all sunk in Mrs . Dashwood ' s romantic delicacy . It was several days before Willoughby ' s name was mentioned before Marianne by any of her family ; Sir John and Mrs . Jennings , indeed , were not so nice ; their witticisms added pain to many a painful hour ;-- but one evening , Mrs . Dashwood , accidentally taking up a volume of Shakespeare , exclaimed , "" We have never finished Hamlet , Marianne ; our dear Willoughby went away before we could get through it . We will put it by , that when he comes again ... But it may be months , perhaps , before THAT happens ."" "" Months !"""
austen#"cried Marianne , with strong surprise . "" No -- nor many weeks ."" Mrs . Dashwood was sorry for what she had said ; but it gave Elinor pleasure , as it produced a reply from Marianne so expressive of confidence in Willoughby and knowledge of his intentions . One morning , about a week after his leaving the country , Marianne was prevailed on to join her sisters in their usual walk , instead of wandering away by herself . Hitherto she had carefully avoided every companion in her rambles . If her sisters intended to walk on the downs , she directly stole away towards the lanes ; if they talked of the valley , she was as speedy in climbing the hills , and could never be found when the others set off ."
austen#"But at length she was secured by the exertions of Elinor , who greatly disapproved such continual seclusion . They walked along the road through the valley , and chiefly in silence , for Marianne ' s MIND could not be controlled , and Elinor , satisfied with gaining one point , would not then attempt more . Beyond the entrance of the valley , where the country , though still rich , was less wild and more open , a long stretch of the road which they had travelled on first coming to Barton , lay before them ; and on reaching that point , they stopped to look around them , and examine a prospect which formed the distance of their view from the cottage , from a spot which they had never happened to reach in any of their walks before . Amongst the objects in the scene , they soon discovered an animated one ; it was a man on horseback riding towards them . In a few minutes they could distinguish him to be a gentleman ; and in a moment afterwards Marianne rapturously exclaimed , "" It is he ; it is indeed ;-- I know it is !"""
austen#"-- and was hastening to meet him , when Elinor cried out , "" Indeed , Marianne , I think you are mistaken . It is not Willoughby . The person is not tall enough for him , and has not his air ."" "" He has , he has ,"" cried Marianne , "" I am sure he has . His air , his coat , his horse ."
austen#"I knew how soon he would come ."" She walked eagerly on as she spoke ; and Elinor , to screen Marianne from particularity , as she felt almost certain of its not being Willoughby , quickened her pace and kept up with her . They were soon within thirty yards of the gentleman . Marianne looked again ; her heart sunk within her ; and abruptly turning round , she was hurrying back , when the voices of both her sisters were raised to detain her ; a third , almost as well known as Willoughby ' s , joined them in begging her to stop , and she turned round with surprise to see and welcome Edward Ferrars . He was the only person in the world who could at that moment be forgiven for not being Willoughby ; the only one who could have gained a smile from her ; but she dispersed her tears to smile on HIM , and in her sister ' s happiness forgot for a time her own disappointment . He dismounted , and giving his horse to his servant , walked back with them to Barton , whither he was purposely coming to visit them ."
austen#He was welcomed by them all with great cordiality , but especially by Marianne , who showed more warmth of regard in her reception of him than even Elinor herself . To Marianne , indeed , the meeting between Edward and her sister was but a continuation of that unaccountable coldness which she had often observed at Norland in their mutual behaviour . On Edward ' s side , more particularly , there was a deficiency of all that a lover ought to look and say on such an occasion . He was confused , seemed scarcely sensible of pleasure in seeing them , looked neither rapturous nor gay , said little but what was forced from him by questions , and distinguished Elinor by no mark of affection . Marianne saw and listened with increasing surprise . She began almost to feel a dislike of Edward ; and it ended , as every feeling must end with her , by carrying back her thoughts to Willoughby , whose manners formed a contrast sufficiently striking to those of his brother elect .
austen#"After a short silence which succeeded the first surprise and enquiries of meeting , Marianne asked Edward if he came directly from London . No , he had been in Devonshire a fortnight . "" A fortnight !"" she repeated , surprised at his being so long in the same county with Elinor without seeing her before . He looked rather distressed as he added , that he had been staying with some friends near Plymouth . "" Have you been lately in Sussex ?"""
austen#"said Elinor . "" I was at Norland about a month ago ."" "" And how does dear , dear Norland look ?"" cried Marianne . "" Dear , dear Norland ,"" said Elinor , "" probably looks much as it always does at this time of the year . The woods and walks thickly covered with dead leaves ."""
austen#""" Oh ,"" cried Marianne , "" with what transporting sensation have I formerly seen them fall ! How have I delighted , as I walked , to see them driven in showers about me by the wind ! What feelings have they , the season , the air altogether inspired ! Now there is no one to regard them . They are seen only as a nuisance , swept hastily off , and driven as much as possible from the sight ."" "" It is not every one ,"" said Elinor , "" who has your passion for dead leaves ."""
austen#""" No ; my feelings are not often shared , not often understood . But SOMETIMES they are ."" -- As she said this , she sunk into a reverie for a few moments ;-- but rousing herself again , "" Now , Edward ,"" said she , calling his attention to the prospect , "" here is Barton valley . Look up to it , and be tranquil if you can . Look at those hills ! Did you ever see their equals ?"
austen#"To the left is Barton park , amongst those woods and plantations . You may see the end of the house . And there , beneath that farthest hill , which rises with such grandeur , is our cottage ."" "" It is a beautiful country ,"" he replied ; "" but these bottoms must be dirty in winter ."" "" How can you think of dirt , with such objects before you ?"" "" Because ,"" replied he , smiling , "" among the rest of the objects before me , I see a very dirty lane ."""
austen#""" How strange !"" said Marianne to herself as she walked on . "" Have you an agreeable neighbourhood here ? Are the Middletons pleasant people ?"" "" No , not all ,"" answered Marianne ; "" we could not be more unfortunately situated ."" "" Marianne ,"" cried her sister , "" how can you say so ?"
austen#"How can you be so unjust ? They are a very respectable family , Mr . Ferrars ; and towards us have behaved in the friendliest manner . Have you forgot , Marianne , how many pleasant days we have owed to them ?"" "" No ,"" said Marianne , in a low voice , "" nor how many painful moments ."" Elinor took no notice of this ; and directing her attention to their visitor , endeavoured to support something like discourse with him , by talking of their present residence , its conveniences , & c . extorting from him occasional questions and remarks . His coldness and reserve mortified her severely ; she was vexed and half angry ; but resolving to regulate her behaviour to him by the past rather than the present , she avoided every appearance of resentment or displeasure , and treated him as she thought he ought to be treated from the family connection ."
austen#CHAPTER 17 Mrs . Dashwood was surprised only for a moment at seeing him ; for his coming to Barton was , in her opinion , of all things the most natural . Her joy and expression of regard long outlived her wonder . He received the kindest welcome from her ; and shyness , coldness , reserve could not stand against such a reception . They had begun to fail him before he entered the house , and they were quite overcome by the captivating manners of Mrs . Dashwood . Indeed a man could not very well be in love with either of her daughters , without extending the passion to her ; and Elinor had the satisfaction of seeing him soon become more like himself .
austen#"His affections seemed to reanimate towards them all , and his interest in their welfare again became perceptible . He was not in spirits , however ; he praised their house , admired its prospect , was attentive , and kind ; but still he was not in spirits . The whole family perceived it , and Mrs . Dashwood , attributing it to some want of liberality in his mother , sat down to table indignant against all selfish parents . "" What are Mrs . Ferrars ' s views for you at present , Edward ?"" said she , when dinner was over and they had drawn round the fire ; "" are you still to be a great orator in spite of yourself ?"" "" No ."
austen#"I hope my mother is now convinced that I have no more talents than inclination for a public life !"" "" But how is your fame to be established ? for famous you must be to satisfy all your family ; and with no inclination for expense , no affection for strangers , no profession , and no assurance , you may find it a difficult matter ."" "" I shall not attempt it . I have no wish to be distinguished ; and have every reason to hope I never shall . Thank Heaven !"
austen#"I cannot be forced into genius and eloquence ."" "" You have no ambition , I well know . Your wishes are all moderate ."" "" As moderate as those of the rest of the world , I believe . I wish as well as every body else to be perfectly happy ; but , like every body else it must be in my own way . Greatness will not make me so ."""
austen#""" Strange that it would !"" cried Marianne . "" What have wealth or grandeur to do with happiness ?"" "" Grandeur has but little ,"" said Elinor , "" but wealth has much to do with it ."" "" Elinor , for shame !"" said Marianne , "" money can only give happiness where there is nothing else to give it ."
austen#"Beyond a competence , it can afford no real satisfaction , as far as mere self is concerned ."" "" Perhaps ,"" said Elinor , smiling , "" we may come to the same point . YOUR competence and MY wealth are very much alike , I dare say ; and without them , as the world goes now , we shall both agree that every kind of external comfort must be wanting . Your ideas are only more noble than mine . Come , what is your competence ?"" "" About eighteen hundred or two thousand a year ; not more than THAT ."""
austen#"Elinor laughed . "" TWO thousand a year ! ONE is my wealth ! I guessed how it would end ."" "" And yet two thousand a - year is a very moderate income ,"" said Marianne . "" A family cannot well be maintained on a smaller ."
austen#"I am sure I am not extravagant in my demands . A proper establishment of servants , a carriage , perhaps two , and hunters , cannot be supported on less ."" Elinor smiled again , to hear her sister describing so accurately their future expenses at Combe Magna . "" Hunters !"" repeated Edward --"" but why must you have hunters ? Every body does not hunt ."""
austen#"Marianne coloured as she replied , "" But most people do ."" "" I wish ,"" said Margaret , striking out a novel thought , "" that somebody would give us all a large fortune apiece !"" "" Oh that they would !"" cried Marianne , her eyes sparkling with animation , and her cheeks glowing with the delight of such imaginary happiness . "" We are all unanimous in that wish , I suppose ,"" said Elinor , "" in spite of the insufficiency of wealth ."" "" Oh dear !"""
austen#"cried Margaret , "" how happy I should be ! I wonder what I should do with it !"" Marianne looked as if she had no doubt on that point . "" I should be puzzled to spend so large a fortune myself ,"" said Mrs . Dashwood , "" if my children were all to be rich my help ."" "" You must begin your improvements on this house ,"" observed Elinor , "" and your difficulties will soon vanish ."" "" What magnificent orders would travel from this family to London ,"" said Edward , "" in such an event !"
austen#"What a happy day for booksellers , music - sellers , and print - shops ! You , Miss Dashwood , would give a general commission for every new print of merit to be sent you -- and as for Marianne , I know her greatness of soul , there would not be music enough in London to content her . And books !-- Thomson , Cowper , Scott -- she would buy them all over and over again : she would buy up every copy , I believe , to prevent their falling into unworthy hands ; and she would have every book that tells her how to admire an old twisted tree . Should not you , Marianne ? Forgive me , if I am very saucy . But I was willing to shew you that I had not forgot our old disputes ."""
austen#""" I love to be reminded of the past , Edward -- whether it be melancholy or gay , I love to recall it -- and you will never offend me by talking of former times . You are very right in supposing how my money would be spent -- some of it , at least -- my loose cash would certainly be employed in improving my collection of music and books ."" "" And the bulk of your fortune would be laid out in annuities on the authors or their heirs ."" "" No , Edward , I should have something else to do with it ."" "" Perhaps , then , you would bestow it as a reward on that person who wrote the ablest defence of your favourite maxim , that no one can ever be in love more than once in their life -- your opinion on that point is unchanged , I presume ?"" "" Undoubtedly ."
austen#"At my time of life opinions are tolerably fixed . It is not likely that I should now see or hear any thing to change them ."" "" Marianne is as steadfast as ever , you see ,"" said Elinor , "" she is not at all altered ."" "" She is only grown a little more grave than she was ."" "" Nay , Edward ,"" said Marianne , "" you need not reproach me . You are not very gay yourself ."""
austen#""" Why should you think so !"" replied he , with a sigh . "" But gaiety never was a part of MY character ."" "" Nor do I think it a part of Marianne ' s ,"" said Elinor ; "" I should hardly call her a lively girl -- she is very earnest , very eager in all she does -- sometimes talks a great deal and always with animation -- but she is not often really merry ."" "" I believe you are right ,"" he replied , "" and yet I have always set her down as a lively girl ."" "" I have frequently detected myself in such kind of mistakes ,"" said Elinor , "" in a total misapprehension of character in some point or other : fancying people so much more gay or grave , or ingenious or stupid than they really are , and I can hardly tell why or in what the deception originated ."
austen#"Sometimes one is guided by what they say of themselves , and very frequently by what other people say of them , without giving oneself time to deliberate and judge ."" "" But I thought it was right , Elinor ,"" said Marianne , "" to be guided wholly by the opinion of other people . I thought our judgments were given us merely to be subservient to those of neighbours . This has always been your doctrine , I am sure ."" "" No , Marianne , never . My doctrine has never aimed at the subjection of the understanding ."
austen#"All I have ever attempted to influence has been the behaviour . You must not confound my meaning . I am guilty , I confess , of having often wished you to treat our acquaintance in general with greater attention ; but when have I advised you to adopt their sentiments or to conform to their judgment in serious matters ?"" "" You have not been able to bring your sister over to your plan of general civility ,"" said Edward to Elinor , "" Do you gain no ground ?"" "" Quite the contrary ,"" replied Elinor , looking expressively at Marianne . "" My judgment ,"" he returned , "" is all on your side of the question ; but I am afraid my practice is much more on your sister ' s ."
austen#"I never wish to offend , but I am so foolishly shy , that I often seem negligent , when I am only kept back by my natural awkwardness . I have frequently thought that I must have been intended by nature to be fond of low company , I am so little at my ease among strangers of gentility !"" "" Marianne has not shyness to excuse any inattention of hers ,"" said Elinor . "" She knows her own worth too well for false shame ,"" replied Edward . "" Shyness is only the effect of a sense of inferiority in some way or other . If I could persuade myself that my manners were perfectly easy and graceful , I should not be shy ."""
austen#""" But you would still be reserved ,"" said Marianne , "" and that is worse ."" Edward started --"" Reserved ! Am I reserved , Marianne ?"" "" Yes , very ."" "" I do not understand you ,"" replied he , colouring . "" Reserved !-- how , in what manner ?"
austen#"What am I to tell you ? What can you suppose ?"" Elinor looked surprised at his emotion ; but trying to laugh off the subject , she said to him , "" Do not you know my sister well enough to understand what she means ? Do not you know she calls every one reserved who does not talk as fast , and admire what she admires as rapturously as herself ?"" Edward made no answer . His gravity and thoughtfulness returned on him in their fullest extent -- and he sat for some time silent and dull ."
austen#CHAPTER 18 Elinor saw , with great uneasiness the low spirits of her friend . His visit afforded her but a very partial satisfaction , while his own enjoyment in it appeared so imperfect . It was evident that he was unhappy ; she wished it were equally evident that he still distinguished her by the same affection which once she had felt no doubt of inspiring ; but hitherto the continuance of his preference seemed very uncertain ; and the reservedness of his manner towards her contradicted one moment what a more animated look had intimated the preceding one . He joined her and Marianne in the breakfast - room the next morning before the others were down ; and Marianne , who was always eager to promote their happiness as far as she could , soon left them to themselves . But before she was half way upstairs she heard the parlour door open , and , turning round , was astonished to see Edward himself come out .
austen#""" I am going into the village to see my horses ,"" said be , "" as you are not yet ready for breakfast ; I shall be back again presently ."" *** Edward returned to them with fresh admiration of the surrounding country ; in his walk to the village , he had seen many parts of the valley to advantage ; and the village itself , in a much higher situation than the cottage , afforded a general view of the whole , which had exceedingly pleased him . This was a subject which ensured Marianne ' s attention , and she was beginning to describe her own admiration of these scenes , and to question him more minutely on the objects that had particularly struck him , when Edward interrupted her by saying , "" You must not enquire too far , Marianne -- remember I have no knowledge in the picturesque , and I shall offend you by my ignorance and want of taste if we come to particulars . I shall call hills steep , which ought to be bold ; surfaces strange and uncouth , which ought to be irregular and rugged ; and distant objects out of sight , which ought only to be indistinct through the soft medium of a hazy atmosphere . You must be satisfied with such admiration as I can honestly give ."
austen#"I call it a very fine country -- the hills are steep , the woods seem full of fine timber , and the valley looks comfortable and snug -- with rich meadows and several neat farm houses scattered here and there . It exactly answers my idea of a fine country , because it unites beauty with utility -- and I dare say it is a picturesque one too , because you admire it ; I can easily believe it to be full of rocks and promontories , grey moss and brush wood , but these are all lost on me . I know nothing of the picturesque ."" "" I am afraid it is but too true ,"" said Marianne ; "" but why should you boast of it ?"" "" I suspect ,"" said Elinor , "" that to avoid one kind of affectation , Edward here falls into another . Because he believes many people pretend to more admiration of the beauties of nature than they really feel , and is disgusted with such pretensions , he affects greater indifference and less discrimination in viewing them himself than he possesses ."
austen#"He is fastidious and will have an affectation of his own ."" "" It is very true ,"" said Marianne , "" that admiration of landscape scenery is become a mere jargon . Every body pretends to feel and tries to describe with the taste and elegance of him who first defined what picturesque beauty was . I detest jargon of every kind , and sometimes I have kept my feelings to myself , because I could find no language to describe them in but what was worn and hackneyed out of all sense and meaning ."" "" I am convinced ,"" said Edward , "" that you really feel all the delight in a fine prospect which you profess to feel . But , in return , your sister must allow me to feel no more than I profess ."
austen#"I like a fine prospect , but not on picturesque principles . I do not like crooked , twisted , blasted trees . I admire them much more if they are tall , straight , and flourishing . I do not like ruined , tattered cottages . I am not fond of nettles or thistles , or heath blossoms . I have more pleasure in a snug farm - house than a watch - tower -- and a troop of tidy , happy villages please me better than the finest banditti in the world ."""
austen#"Marianne looked with amazement at Edward , with compassion at her sister . Elinor only laughed . The subject was continued no farther ; and Marianne remained thoughtfully silent , till a new object suddenly engaged her attention . She was sitting by Edward , and in taking his tea from Mrs . Dashwood , his hand passed so directly before her , as to make a ring , with a plait of hair in the centre , very conspicuous on one of his fingers . "" I never saw you wear a ring before , Edward ,"" she cried . "" Is that Fanny ' s hair ?"
austen#"I remember her promising to give you some . But I should have thought her hair had been darker ."" Marianne spoke inconsiderately what she really felt -- but when she saw how much she had pained Edward , her own vexation at her want of thought could not be surpassed by his . He coloured very deeply , and giving a momentary glance at Elinor , replied , "" Yes ; it is my sister ' s hair . The setting always casts a different shade on it , you know ."" Elinor had met his eye , and looked conscious likewise ."
austen#That the hair was her own , she instantaneously felt as well satisfied as Marianne ; the only difference in their conclusions was , that what Marianne considered as a free gift from her sister , Elinor was conscious must have been procured by some theft or contrivance unknown to herself . She was not in a humour , however , to regard it as an affront , and affecting to take no notice of what passed , by instantly talking of something else , she internally resolved henceforward to catch every opportunity of eyeing the hair and of satisfying herself , beyond all doubt , that it was exactly the shade of her own . Edward ' s embarrassment lasted some time , and it ended in an absence of mind still more settled . He was particularly grave the whole morning . Marianne severely censured herself for what she had said ; but her own forgiveness might have been more speedy , had she known how little offence it had given her sister . Before the middle of the day , they were visited by Sir John and Mrs . Jennings , who , having heard of the arrival of a gentleman at the cottage , came to take a survey of the guest .
austen#"With the assistance of his mother - in - law , Sir John was not long in discovering that the name of Ferrars began with an F . and this prepared a future mine of raillery against the devoted Elinor , which nothing but the newness of their acquaintance with Edward could have prevented from being immediately sprung . But , as it was , she only learned , from some very significant looks , how far their penetration , founded on Margaret ' s instructions , extended . Sir John never came to the Dashwoods without either inviting them to dine at the park the next day , or to drink tea with them that evening . On the present occasion , for the better entertainment of their visitor , towards whose amusement he felt himself bound to contribute , he wished to engage them for both . "" You MUST drink tea with us to night ,"" said he , "" for we shall be quite alone -- and tomorrow you must absolutely dine with us , for we shall be a large party ."" Mrs . Jennings enforced the necessity ."
austen#""" And who knows but you may raise a dance ,"" said she . "" And that will tempt YOU , Miss Marianne ."" "" A dance !"" cried Marianne . "" Impossible ! Who is to dance ?"""
austen#""" Who ! why yourselves , and the Careys , and Whitakers to be sure .-- What ! you thought nobody could dance because a certain person that shall be nameless is gone !"" "" I wish with all my soul ,"" cried Sir John , "" that Willoughby were among us again ."" This , and Marianne ' s blushing , gave new suspicions to Edward . "" And who is Willoughby ?"""
austen#"said he , in a low voice , to Miss Dashwood , by whom he was sitting . She gave him a brief reply . Marianne ' s countenance was more communicative . Edward saw enough to comprehend , not only the meaning of others , but such of Marianne ' s expressions as had puzzled him before ; and when their visitors left them , he went immediately round her , and said , in a whisper , "" I have been guessing . Shall I tell you my guess ?"" "" What do you mean ?"""
austen#""" Shall I tell you ."" "" Certainly ."" "" Well then ; I guess that Mr . Willoughby hunts ."" Marianne was surprised and confused , yet she could not help smiling at the quiet archness of his manner , and after a moment ' s silence , said , "" Oh , Edward ! How can you ?-- But the time will come I hope ... I am sure you will like him ."""
austen#""" I do not doubt it ,"" replied he , rather astonished at her earnestness and warmth ; for had he not imagined it to be a joke for the good of her acquaintance in general , founded only on a something or a nothing between Mr . Willoughby and herself , he would not have ventured to mention it . CHAPTER 19 Edward remained a week at the cottage ; he was earnestly pressed by Mrs . Dashwood to stay longer ; but , as if he were bent only on self - mortification , he seemed resolved to be gone when his enjoyment among his friends was at the height . His spirits , during the last two or three days , though still very unequal , were greatly improved -- he grew more and more partial to the house and environs -- never spoke of going away without a sigh -- declared his time to be wholly disengaged -- even doubted to what place he should go when he left them -- but still , go he must . Never had any week passed so quickly -- he could hardly believe it to be gone . He said so repeatedly ; other things he said too , which marked the turn of his feelings and gave the lie to his actions ."
austen#He had no pleasure at Norland ; he detested being in town ; but either to Norland or London , he must go . He valued their kindness beyond any thing , and his greatest happiness was in being with them . Yet , he must leave them at the end of a week , in spite of their wishes and his own , and without any restraint on his time . Elinor placed all that was astonishing in this way of acting to his mother ' s account ; and it was happy for her that he had a mother whose character was so imperfectly known to her , as to be the general excuse for every thing strange on the part of her son . Disappointed , however , and vexed as she was , and sometimes displeased with his uncertain behaviour to herself , she was very well disposed on the whole to regard his actions with all the candid allowances and generous qualifications , which had been rather more painfully extorted from her , for Willoughby ' s service , by her mother . His want of spirits , of openness , and of consistency , were most usually attributed to his want of independence , and his better knowledge of Mrs . Ferrars ' s disposition and designs .
austen#"The shortness of his visit , the steadiness of his purpose in leaving them , originated in the same fettered inclination , the same inevitable necessity of temporizing with his mother . The old well - established grievance of duty against will , parent against child , was the cause of all . She would have been glad to know when these difficulties were to cease , this opposition was to yield ,-- when Mrs . Ferrars would be reformed , and her son be at liberty to be happy . But from such vain wishes she was forced to turn for comfort to the renewal of her confidence in Edward ' s affection , to the remembrance of every mark of regard in look or word which fell from him while at Barton , and above all to that flattering proof of it which he constantly wore round his finger . "" I think , Edward ,"" said Mrs . Dashwood , as they were at breakfast the last morning , "" you would be a happier man if you had any profession to engage your time and give an interest to your plans and actions . Some inconvenience to your friends , indeed , might result from it -- you would not be able to give them so much of your time ."
austen#"But ( with a smile ) you would be materially benefited in one particular at least -- you would know where to go when you left them ."" "" I do assure you ,"" he replied , "" that I have long thought on this point , as you think now . It has been , and is , and probably will always be a heavy misfortune to me , that I have had no necessary business to engage me , no profession to give me employment , or afford me any thing like independence . But unfortunately my own nicety , and the nicety of my friends , have made me what I am , an idle , helpless being . We never could agree in our choice of a profession . I always preferred the church , as I still do ."
austen#But that was not smart enough for my family . They recommended the army . That was a great deal too smart for me . The law was allowed to be genteel enough ; many young men , who had chambers in the Temple , made a very good appearance in the first circles , and drove about town in very knowing gigs . But I had no inclination for the law , even in this less abstruse study of it , which my family approved . As for the navy , it had fashion on its side , but I was too old when the subject was first started to enter it -- and , at length , as there was no necessity for my having any profession at all , as I might be as dashing and expensive without a red coat on my back as with one , idleness was pronounced on the whole to be most advantageous and honourable , and a young man of eighteen is not in general so earnestly bent on being busy as to resist the solicitations of his friends to do nothing .
austen#"I was therefore entered at Oxford and have been properly idle ever since ."" "" The consequence of which , I suppose , will be ,"" said Mrs . Dashwood , "" since leisure has not promoted your own happiness , that your sons will be brought up to as many pursuits , employments , professions , and trades as Columella ' s ."" "" They will be brought up ,"" said he , in a serious accent , "" to be as unlike myself as is possible . In feeling , in action , in condition , in every thing ."" "" Come , come ; this is all an effusion of immediate want of spirits , Edward . You are in a melancholy humour , and fancy that any one unlike yourself must be happy ."
austen#"But remember that the pain of parting from friends will be felt by every body at times , whatever be their education or state . Know your own happiness . You want nothing but patience -- or give it a more fascinating name , call it hope . Your mother will secure to you , in time , that independence you are so anxious for ; it is her duty , and it will , it must ere long become her happiness to prevent your whole youth from being wasted in discontent . How much may not a few months do ?"" "" I think ,"" replied Edward , "" that I may defy many months to produce any good to me ."""
austen#This desponding turn of mind , though it could not be communicated to Mrs . Dashwood , gave additional pain to them all in the parting , which shortly took place , and left an uncomfortable impression on Elinor ' s feelings especially , which required some trouble and time to subdue . But as it was her determination to subdue it , and to prevent herself from appearing to suffer more than what all her family suffered on his going away , she did not adopt the method so judiciously employed by Marianne , on a similar occasion , to augment and fix her sorrow , by seeking silence , solitude and idleness . Their means were as different as their objects , and equally suited to the advancement of each . Elinor sat down to her drawing - table as soon as he was out of the house , busily employed herself the whole day , neither sought nor avoided the mention of his name , appeared to interest herself almost as much as ever in the general concerns of the family , and if , by this conduct , she did not lessen her own grief , it was at least prevented from unnecessary increase , and her mother and sisters were spared much solicitude on her account . Such behaviour as this , so exactly the reverse of her own , appeared no more meritorious to Marianne , than her own had seemed faulty to her . The business of self - command she settled very easily ;-- with strong affections it was impossible , with calm ones it could have no merit .
austen#That her sister ' s affections WERE calm , she dared not deny , though she blushed to acknowledge it ; and of the strength of her own , she gave a very striking proof , by still loving and respecting that sister , in spite of this mortifying conviction . Without shutting herself up from her family , or leaving the house in determined solitude to avoid them , or lying awake the whole night to indulge meditation , Elinor found every day afforded her leisure enough to think of Edward , and of Edward ' s behaviour , in every possible variety which the different state of her spirits at different times could produce ,-- with tenderness , pity , approbation , censure , and doubt . There were moments in abundance , when , if not by the absence of her mother and sisters , at least by the nature of their employments , conversation was forbidden among them , and every effect of solitude was produced . Her mind was inevitably at liberty ; her thoughts could not be chained elsewhere ; and the past and the future , on a subject so interesting , must be before her , must force her attention , and engross her memory , her reflection , and her fancy . From a reverie of this kind , as she sat at her drawing - table , she was roused one morning , soon after Edward ' s leaving them , by the arrival of company . She happened to be quite alone .
austen#"The closing of the little gate , at the entrance of the green court in front of the house , drew her eyes to the window , and she saw a large party walking up to the door . Amongst them were Sir John and Lady Middleton and Mrs . Jennings , but there were two others , a gentleman and lady , who were quite unknown to her . She was sitting near the window , and as soon as Sir John perceived her , he left the rest of the party to the ceremony of knocking at the door , and stepping across the turf , obliged her to open the casement to speak to him , though the space was so short between the door and the window , as to make it hardly possible to speak at one without being heard at the other . "" Well ,"" said he , "" we have brought you some strangers . How do you like them ?"" "" Hush !"
austen#"they will hear you ."" "" Never mind if they do . It is only the Palmers . Charlotte is very pretty , I can tell you . You may see her if you look this way ."" As Elinor was certain of seeing her in a couple of minutes , without taking that liberty , she begged to be excused ."
austen#""" Where is Marianne ? Has she run away because we are come ? I see her instrument is open ."" "" She is walking , I believe ."" They were now joined by Mrs . Jennings , who had not patience enough to wait till the door was opened before she told HER story . She came hallooing to the window , "" How do you do , my dear ?"
austen#How does Mrs . Dashwood do ? And where are your sisters ? What ! all alone ! you will be glad of a little company to sit with you . I have brought my other son and daughter to see you .
austen#"Only think of their coming so suddenly ! I thought I heard a carriage last night , while we were drinking our tea , but it never entered my head that it could be them . I thought of nothing but whether it might not be Colonel Brandon come back again ; so I said to Sir John , I do think I hear a carriage ; perhaps it is Colonel Brandon come back again ""-- Elinor was obliged to turn from her , in the middle of her story , to receive the rest of the party ; Lady Middleton introduced the two strangers ; Mrs . Dashwood and Margaret came down stairs at the same time , and they all sat down to look at one another , while Mrs . Jennings continued her story as she walked through the passage into the parlour , attended by Sir John . Mrs . Palmer was several years younger than Lady Middleton , and totally unlike her in every respect . She was short and plump , had a very pretty face , and the finest expression of good humour in it that could possibly be ."
austen#"Her manners were by no means so elegant as her sister ' s , but they were much more prepossessing . She came in with a smile , smiled all the time of her visit , except when she laughed , and smiled when she went away . Her husband was a grave looking young man of five or six and twenty , with an air of more fashion and sense than his wife , but of less willingness to please or be pleased . He entered the room with a look of self - consequence , slightly bowed to the ladies , without speaking a word , and , after briefly surveying them and their apartments , took up a newspaper from the table , and continued to read it as long as he staid . Mrs . Palmer , on the contrary , who was strongly endowed by nature with a turn for being uniformly civil and happy , was hardly seated before her admiration of the parlour and every thing in it burst forth . "" Well !"
austen#what a delightful room this is ! I never saw anything so charming ! Only think , Mamma , how it is improved since I was here last ! I always thought it such a sweet place , ma ' am ! ( turning to Mrs . Dashwood ) but you have made it so charming ! Only look , sister , how delightful every thing is !
austen#"How I should like such a house for myself ! Should not you , Mr . Palmer ?"" Mr . Palmer made her no answer , and did not even raise his eyes from the newspaper . "" Mr . Palmer does not hear me ,"" said she , laughing ; "" he never does sometimes . It is so ridiculous !"""
austen#"This was quite a new idea to Mrs . Dashwood ; she had never been used to find wit in the inattention of any one , and could not help looking with surprise at them both . Mrs . Jennings , in the meantime , talked on as loud as she could , and continued her account of their surprise , the evening before , on seeing their friends , without ceasing till every thing was told . Mrs . Palmer laughed heartily at the recollection of their astonishment , and every body agreed , two or three times over , that it had been quite an agreeable surprise . "" You may believe how glad we all were to see them ,"" added Mrs . Jennings , leaning forward towards Elinor , and speaking in a low voice as if she meant to be heard by no one else , though they were seated on different sides of the room ; "" but , however , I can ' t help wishing they had not travelled quite so fast , nor made such a long journey of it , for they came all round by London upon account of some business , for you know ( nodding significantly and pointing to her daughter ) it was wrong in her situation . I wanted her to stay at home and rest this morning , but she would come with us ; she longed so much to see you all !"" Mrs . Palmer laughed , and said it would not do her any harm ."
austen#""" She expects to be confined in February ,"" continued Mrs . Jennings . Lady Middleton could no longer endure such a conversation , and therefore exerted herself to ask Mr . Palmer if there was any news in the paper . "" No , none at all ,"" he replied , and read on . "" Here comes Marianne ,"" cried Sir John . "" Now , Palmer , you shall see a monstrous pretty girl ."" He immediately went into the passage , opened the front door , and ushered her in himself ."
austen#"Mrs . Jennings asked her , as soon as she appeared , if she had not been to Allenham ; and Mrs . Palmer laughed so heartily at the question , as to show she understood it . Mr . Palmer looked up on her entering the room , stared at her some minutes , and then returned to his newspaper . Mrs . Palmer ' s eye was now caught by the drawings which hung round the room . She got up to examine them . "" Oh ! dear , how beautiful these are !"
austen#"Well ! how delightful ! Do but look , mama , how sweet ! I declare they are quite charming ; I could look at them for ever ."" And then sitting down again , she very soon forgot that there were any such things in the room . When Lady Middleton rose to go away , Mr . Palmer rose also , laid down the newspaper , stretched himself and looked at them all around ."
austen#""" My love , have you been asleep ?"" said his wife , laughing . He made her no answer ; and only observed , after again examining the room , that it was very low pitched , and that the ceiling was crooked . He then made his bow , and departed with the rest . Sir John had been very urgent with them all to spend the next day at the park . Mrs . Dashwood , who did not chuse to dine with them oftener than they dined at the cottage , absolutely refused on her own account ; her daughters might do as they pleased ."
austen#"But they had no curiosity to see how Mr . and Mrs . Palmer ate their dinner , and no expectation of pleasure from them in any other way . They attempted , therefore , likewise , to excuse themselves ; the weather was uncertain , and not likely to be good . But Sir John would not be satisfied -- the carriage should be sent for them and they must come . Lady Middleton too , though she did not press their mother , pressed them . Mrs . Jennings and Mrs . Palmer joined their entreaties , all seemed equally anxious to avoid a family party ; and the young ladies were obliged to yield . "" Why should they ask us ?"""
austen#"said Marianne , as soon as they were gone . "" The rent of this cottage is said to be low ; but we have it on very hard terms , if we are to dine at the park whenever any one is staying either with them , or with us ."" "" They mean no less to be civil and kind to us now ,"" said Elinor , "" by these frequent invitations , than by those which we received from them a few weeks ago . The alteration is not in them , if their parties are grown tedious and dull . We must look for the change elsewhere ."" CHAPTER 20"
austen#"As the Miss Dashwoods entered the drawing - room of the park the next day , at one door , Mrs . Palmer came running in at the other , looking as good humoured and merry as before . She took them all most affectionately by the hand , and expressed great delight in seeing them again . "" I am so glad to see you !"" said she , seating herself between Elinor and Marianne , "" for it is so bad a day I was afraid you might not come , which would be a shocking thing , as we go away again tomorrow . We must go , for the Westons come to us next week you know . It was quite a sudden thing our coming at all , and I knew nothing of it till the carriage was coming to the door , and then Mr . Palmer asked me if I would go with him to Barton ."
austen#"He is so droll ! He never tells me any thing ! I am so sorry we cannot stay longer ; however we shall meet again in town very soon , I hope ."" They were obliged to put an end to such an expectation . "" Not go to town !"" cried Mrs . Palmer , with a laugh , "" I shall be quite disappointed if you do not ."
austen#"I could get the nicest house in world for you , next door to ours , in Hanover - square . You must come , indeed . I am sure I shall be very happy to chaperon you at any time till I am confined , if Mrs . Dashwood should not like to go into public ."" They thanked her ; but were obliged to resist all her entreaties . "" Oh , my love ,"" cried Mrs . Palmer to her husband , who just then entered the room --"" you must help me to persuade the Miss Dashwoods to go to town this winter ."" Her love made no answer ; and after slightly bowing to the ladies , began complaining of the weather ."
austen#""" How horrid all this is !"" said he . "" Such weather makes every thing and every body disgusting . Dullness is as much produced within doors as without , by rain . It makes one detest all one ' s acquaintance . What the devil does Sir John mean by not having a billiard room in his house ?"
austen#"How few people know what comfort is ! Sir John is as stupid as the weather ."" The rest of the company soon dropt in . "" I am afraid , Miss Marianne ,"" said Sir John , "" you have not been able to take your usual walk to Allenham today ."" Marianne looked very grave and said nothing . "" Oh , don ' t be so sly before us ,"" said Mrs . Palmer ; "" for we know all about it , I assure you ; and I admire your taste very much , for I think he is extremely handsome ."
austen#"We do not live a great way from him in the country , you know . Not above ten miles , I dare say ."" "" Much nearer thirty ,"" said her husband . "" Ah , well ! there is not much difference . I never was at his house ; but they say it is a sweet pretty place ."""
austen#""" As vile a spot as I ever saw in my life ,"" said Mr . Palmer . Marianne remained perfectly silent , though her countenance betrayed her interest in what was said . "" Is it very ugly ?"" continued Mrs . Palmer --"" then it must be some other place that is so pretty I suppose ."" When they were seated in the dining room , Sir John observed with regret that they were only eight all together . "" My dear ,"" said he to his lady , "" it is very provoking that we should be so few ."
austen#"Why did not you ask the Gilberts to come to us today ?"" "" Did not I tell you , Sir John , when you spoke to me about it before , that it could not be done ? They dined with us last ."" "" You and I , Sir John ,"" said Mrs . Jennings , "" should not stand upon such ceremony ."" "" Then you would be very ill - bred ,"" cried Mr . Palmer . "" My love you contradict every body ,"" said his wife with her usual laugh ."
austen#""" Do you know that you are quite rude ?"" "" I did not know I contradicted any body in calling your mother ill - bred ."" "" Ay , you may abuse me as you please ,"" said the good - natured old lady , "" you have taken Charlotte off my hands , and cannot give her back again . So there I have the whip hand of you ."" Charlotte laughed heartily to think that her husband could not get rid of her ; and exultingly said , she did not care how cross he was to her , as they must live together . It was impossible for any one to be more thoroughly good - natured , or more determined to be happy than Mrs . Palmer ."
austen#"The studied indifference , insolence , and discontent of her husband gave her no pain ; and when he scolded or abused her , she was highly diverted . "" Mr . Palmer is so droll !"" said she , in a whisper , to Elinor . "" He is always out of humour ."" Elinor was not inclined , after a little observation , to give him credit for being so genuinely and unaffectedly ill - natured or ill - bred as he wished to appear . His temper might perhaps be a little soured by finding , like many others of his sex , that through some unaccountable bias in favour of beauty , he was the husband of a very silly woman ,-- but she knew that this kind of blunder was too common for any sensible man to be lastingly hurt by it .-- It was rather a wish of distinction , she believed , which produced his contemptuous treatment of every body , and his general abuse of every thing before him ."
austen#"It was the desire of appearing superior to other people . The motive was too common to be wondered at ; but the means , however they might succeed by establishing his superiority in ill - breeding , were not likely to attach any one to him except his wife . "" Oh , my dear Miss Dashwood ,"" said Mrs . Palmer soon afterwards , "" I have got such a favour to ask of you and your sister . Will you come and spend some time at Cleveland this Christmas ? Now , pray do ,-- and come while the Westons are with us . You cannot think how happy I shall be !"
austen#"It will be quite delightful !-- My love ,"" applying to her husband , "" don ' t you long to have the Miss Dashwoods come to Cleveland ?"" "" Certainly ,"" he replied , with a sneer --"" I came into Devonshire with no other view ."" "" There now ,""-- said his lady , "" you see Mr . Palmer expects you ; so you cannot refuse to come ."" They both eagerly and resolutely declined her invitation . "" But indeed you must and shall come . I am sure you will like it of all things ."
austen#"The Westons will be with us , and it will be quite delightful . You cannot think what a sweet place Cleveland is ; and we are so gay now , for Mr . Palmer is always going about the country canvassing against the election ; and so many people came to dine with us that I never saw before , it is quite charming ! But , poor fellow ! it is very fatiguing to him ! for he is forced to make every body like him ."" Elinor could hardly keep her countenance as she assented to the hardship of such an obligation ."
austen#""" How charming it will be ,"" said Charlotte , "" when he is in Parliament !-- won ' t it ? How I shall laugh ! It will be so ridiculous to see all his letters directed to him with an M . P .-- But do you know , he says , he will never frank for me ? He declares he won ' t . Don ' t you , Mr . Palmer ?"""
austen#"Mr . Palmer took no notice of her . "" He cannot bear writing , you know ,"" she continued -- "" he says it is quite shocking ."" "" No ,"" said he , "" I never said any thing so irrational . Don ' t palm all your abuses of languages upon me ."" "" There now ; you see how droll he is . This is always the way with him !"
austen#"Sometimes he won ' t speak to me for half a day together , and then he comes out with something so droll -- all about any thing in the world ."" She surprised Elinor very much as they returned into the drawing - room , by asking her whether she did not like Mr . Palmer excessively . "" Certainly ,"" said Elinor ; "" he seems very agreeable ."" "" Well -- I am so glad you do . I thought you would , he is so pleasant ; and Mr . Palmer is excessively pleased with you and your sisters I can tell you , and you can ' t think how disappointed he will be if you don ' t come to Cleveland .-- I can ' t imagine why you should object to it ."" Elinor was again obliged to decline her invitation ; and by changing the subject , put a stop to her entreaties ."
austen#"She thought it probable that as they lived in the same county , Mrs . Palmer might be able to give some more particular account of Willoughby ' s general character , than could be gathered from the Middletons ' partial acquaintance with him ; and she was eager to gain from any one , such a confirmation of his merits as might remove the possibility of fear from Marianne . She began by inquiring if they saw much of Mr . Willoughby at Cleveland , and whether they were intimately acquainted with him . "" Oh dear , yes ; I know him extremely well ,"" replied Mrs . Palmer ;--"" Not that I ever spoke to him , indeed ; but I have seen him for ever in town . Somehow or other I never happened to be staying at Barton while he was at Allenham . Mama saw him here once before ;-- but I was with my uncle at Weymouth . However , I dare say we should have seen a great deal of him in Somersetshire , if it had not happened very unluckily that we should never have been in the country together ."
austen#"He is very little at Combe , I believe ; but if he were ever so much there , I do not think Mr . Palmer would visit him , for he is in the opposition , you know , and besides it is such a way off . I know why you inquire about him , very well ; your sister is to marry him . I am monstrous glad of it , for then I shall have her for a neighbour you know ."" "" Upon my word ,"" replied Elinor , "" you know much more of the matter than I do , if you have any reason to expect such a match ."" "" Don ' t pretend to deny it , because you know it is what every body talks of . I assure you I heard of it in my way through town ."""
austen#""" My dear Mrs . Palmer !"" "" Upon my honour I did .-- I met Colonel Brandon Monday morning in Bond - street , just before we left town , and he told me of it directly ."" "" You surprise me very much . Colonel Brandon tell you of it ! Surely you must be mistaken ."
austen#"To give such intelligence to a person who could not be interested in it , even if it were true , is not what I should expect Colonel Brandon to do ."" "" But I do assure you it was so , for all that , and I will tell you how it happened . When we met him , he turned back and walked with us ; and so we began talking of my brother and sister , and one thing and another , and I said to him , ' So , Colonel , there is a new family come to Barton cottage , I hear , and mama sends me word they are very pretty , and that one of them is going to be married to Mr . Willoughby of Combe Magna . Is it true , pray ? for of course you must know , as you have been in Devonshire so lately .'"" "" And what did the Colonel say ?"""
austen#""" Oh -- he did not say much ; but he looked as if he knew it to be true , so from that moment I set it down as certain . It will be quite delightful , I declare ! When is it to take place ?"" "" Mr . Brandon was very well I hope ?"" "" Oh ! yes , quite well ; and so full of your praises , he did nothing but say fine things of you ."""
austen#""" I am flattered by his commendation . He seems an excellent man ; and I think him uncommonly pleasing ."" "" So do I .-- He is such a charming man , that it is quite a pity he should be so grave and so dull . Mamma says HE was in love with your sister too .-- I assure you it was a great compliment if he was , for he hardly ever falls in love with any body ."" "" Is Mr . Willoughby much known in your part of Somersetshire ?"" said Elinor ."
austen#""" Oh ! yes , extremely well ; that is , I do not believe many people are acquainted with him , because Combe Magna is so far off ; but they all think him extremely agreeable I assure you . Nobody is more liked than Mr . Willoughby wherever he goes , and so you may tell your sister . She is a monstrous lucky girl to get him , upon my honour ; not but that he is much more lucky in getting her , because she is so very handsome and agreeable , that nothing can be good enough for her . However , I don ' t think her hardly at all handsomer than you , I assure you ; for I think you both excessively pretty , and so does Mr . Palmer too I am sure , though we could not get him to own it last night ."" Mrs . Palmer ' s information respecting Willoughby was not very material ; but any testimony in his favour , however small , was pleasing to her ."
austen#""" I am so glad we are got acquainted at last ,"" continued Charlotte .--"" And now I hope we shall always be great friends . You can ' t think how much I longed to see you ! It is so delightful that you should live at the cottage ! Nothing can be like it , to be sure ! And I am so glad your sister is going to be well married ! I hope you will be a great deal at Combe Magna ."
austen#"It is a sweet place , by all accounts ."" "" You have been long acquainted with Colonel Brandon , have not you ?"" "" Yes , a great while ; ever since my sister married .-- He was a particular friend of Sir John ' s . I believe ,"" she added in a low voice , "" he would have been very glad to have had me , if he could . Sir John and Lady Middleton wished it very much . But mama did not think the match good enough for me , otherwise Sir John would have mentioned it to the Colonel , and we should have been married immediately ."""
austen#""" Did not Colonel Brandon know of Sir John ' s proposal to your mother before it was made ? Had he never owned his affection to yourself ?"" "" Oh , no ; but if mama had not objected to it , I dare say he would have liked it of all things . He had not seen me then above twice , for it was before I left school . However , I am much happier as I am . Mr . Palmer is the kind of man I like ."""
austen#CHAPTER 21 The Palmers returned to Cleveland the next day , and the two families at Barton were again left to entertain each other . But this did not last long ; Elinor had hardly got their last visitors out of her head , had hardly done wondering at Charlotte ' s being so happy without a cause , at Mr . Palmer ' s acting so simply , with good abilities , and at the strange unsuitableness which often existed between husband and wife , before Sir John ' s and Mrs . Jennings ' s active zeal in the cause of society , procured her some other new acquaintance to see and observe . In a morning ' s excursion to Exeter , they had met with two young ladies , whom Mrs . Jennings had the satisfaction of discovering to be her relations , and this was enough for Sir John to invite them directly to the park , as soon as their present engagements at Exeter were over . Their engagements at Exeter instantly gave way before such an invitation , and Lady Middleton was thrown into no little alarm on the return of Sir John , by hearing that she was very soon to receive a visit from two girls whom she had never seen in her life , and of whose elegance ,-- whose tolerable gentility even , she could have no proof ; for the assurances of her husband and mother on that subject went for nothing at all . Their being her relations too made it so much the worse ; and Mrs . Jennings ' s attempts at consolation were therefore unfortunately founded , when she advised her daughter not to care about their being so fashionable ; because they were all cousins and must put up with one another .
austen#As it was impossible , however , now to prevent their coming , Lady Middleton resigned herself to the idea of it , with all the philosophy of a well - bred woman , contenting herself with merely giving her husband a gentle reprimand on the subject five or six times every day . The young ladies arrived : their appearance was by no means ungenteel or unfashionable . Their dress was very smart , their manners very civil , they were delighted with the house , and in raptures with the furniture , and they happened to be so doatingly fond of children that Lady Middleton ' s good opinion was engaged in their favour before they had been an hour at the Park . She declared them to be very agreeable girls indeed , which for her ladyship was enthusiastic admiration . Sir John ' s confidence in his own judgment rose with this animated praise , and he set off directly for the cottage to tell the Miss Dashwoods of the Miss Steeles ' arrival , and to assure them of their being the sweetest girls in the world . From such commendation as this , however , there was not much to be learned ; Elinor well knew that the sweetest girls in the world were to be met with in every part of England , under every possible variation of form , face , temper and understanding .
austen#"Sir John wanted the whole family to walk to the Park directly and look at his guests . Benevolent , philanthropic man ! It was painful to him even to keep a third cousin to himself . "" Do come now ,"" said he --"" pray come -- you must come -- I declare you shall come -- You can ' t think how you will like them . Lucy is monstrous pretty , and so good humoured and agreeable ! The children are all hanging about her already , as if she was an old acquaintance ."
austen#"And they both long to see you of all things , for they have heard at Exeter that you are the most beautiful creatures in the world ; and I have told them it is all very true , and a great deal more . You will be delighted with them I am sure . They have brought the whole coach full of playthings for the children . How can you be so cross as not to come ? Why they are your cousins , you know , after a fashion . YOU are my cousins , and they are my wife ' s , so you must be related ."""
austen#But Sir John could not prevail . He could only obtain a promise of their calling at the Park within a day or two , and then left them in amazement at their indifference , to walk home and boast anew of their attractions to the Miss Steeles , as he had been already boasting of the Miss Steeles to them . When their promised visit to the Park and consequent introduction to these young ladies took place , they found in the appearance of the eldest , who was nearly thirty , with a very plain and not a sensible face , nothing to admire ; but in the other , who was not more than two or three and twenty , they acknowledged considerable beauty ; her features were pretty , and she had a sharp quick eye , and a smartness of air , which though it did not give actual elegance or grace , gave distinction to her person .-- Their manners were particularly civil , and Elinor soon allowed them credit for some kind of sense , when she saw with what constant and judicious attention they were making themselves agreeable to Lady Middleton . With her children they were in continual raptures , extolling their beauty , courting their notice , and humouring their whims ; and such of their time as could be spared from the importunate demands which this politeness made on it , was spent in admiration of whatever her ladyship was doing , if she happened to be doing any thing , or in taking patterns of some elegant new dress , in which her appearance the day before had thrown them into unceasing delight . Fortunately for those who pay their court through such foibles , a fond mother , though , in pursuit of praise for her children , the most rapacious of human beings , is likewise the most credulous ; her demands are exorbitant ; but she will swallow any thing ; and the excessive affection and endurance of the Miss Steeles towards her offspring were viewed therefore by Lady Middleton without the smallest surprise or distrust . She saw with maternal complacency all the impertinent encroachments and mischievous tricks to which her cousins submitted .
austen#"She saw their sashes untied , their hair pulled about their ears , their work - bags searched , and their knives and scissors stolen away , and felt no doubt of its being a reciprocal enjoyment . It suggested no other surprise than that Elinor and Marianne should sit so composedly by , without claiming a share in what was passing . "" John is in such spirits today !"" said she , on his taking Miss Steeles ' s pocket handkerchief , and throwing it out of window --"" He is full of monkey tricks ."" And soon afterwards , on the second boy ' s violently pinching one of the same lady ' s fingers , she fondly observed , "" How playful William is !"" "" And here is my sweet little Annamaria ,"" she added , tenderly caressing a little girl of three years old , who had not made a noise for the last two minutes ; "" And she is always so gentle and quiet -- Never was there such a quiet little thing !"""
austen#"But unfortunately in bestowing these embraces , a pin in her ladyship ' s head dress slightly scratching the child ' s neck , produced from this pattern of gentleness such violent screams , as could hardly be outdone by any creature professedly noisy . The mother ' s consternation was excessive ; but it could not surpass the alarm of the Miss Steeles , and every thing was done by all three , in so critical an emergency , which affection could suggest as likely to assuage the agonies of the little sufferer . She was seated in her mother ' s lap , covered with kisses , her wound bathed with lavender - water , by one of the Miss Steeles , who was on her knees to attend her , and her mouth stuffed with sugar plums by the other . With such a reward for her tears , the child was too wise to cease crying . She still screamed and sobbed lustily , kicked her two brothers for offering to touch her , and all their united soothings were ineffectual till Lady Middleton luckily remembering that in a scene of similar distress last week , some apricot marmalade had been successfully applied for a bruised temple , the same remedy was eagerly proposed for this unfortunate scratch , and a slight intermission of screams in the young lady on hearing it , gave them reason to hope that it would not be rejected .-- She was carried out of the room therefore in her mother ' s arms , in quest of this medicine , and as the two boys chose to follow , though earnestly entreated by their mother to stay behind , the four young ladies were left in a quietness which the room had not known for many hours . "" Poor little creatures !"""
austen#"said Miss Steele , as soon as they were gone . "" It might have been a very sad accident ."" "" Yet I hardly know how ,"" cried Marianne , "" unless it had been under totally different circumstances . But this is the usual way of heightening alarm , where there is nothing to be alarmed at in reality ."" "" What a sweet woman Lady Middleton is !"" said Lucy Steele ."
austen#"Marianne was silent ; it was impossible for her to say what she did not feel , however trivial the occasion ; and upon Elinor therefore the whole task of telling lies when politeness required it , always fell . She did her best when thus called on , by speaking of Lady Middleton with more warmth than she felt , though with far less than Miss Lucy . "" And Sir John too ,"" cried the elder sister , "" what a charming man he is !"" Here too , Miss Dashwood ' s commendation , being only simple and just , came in without any eclat . She merely observed that he was perfectly good humoured and friendly . "" And what a charming little family they have !"
austen#"I never saw such fine children in my life .-- I declare I quite doat upon them already , and indeed I am always distractedly fond of children ."" "" I should guess so ,"" said Elinor , with a smile , "" from what I have witnessed this morning ."" "" I have a notion ,"" said Lucy , "" you think the little Middletons rather too much indulged ; perhaps they may be the outside of enough ; but it is so natural in Lady Middleton ; and for my part , I love to see children full of life and spirits ; I cannot bear them if they are tame and quiet ."" "" I confess ,"" replied Elinor , "" that while I am at Barton Park , I never think of tame and quiet children with any abhorrence ."" A short pause succeeded this speech , which was first broken by Miss Steele , who seemed very much disposed for conversation , and who now said rather abruptly , "" And how do you like Devonshire , Miss Dashwood ? I suppose you were very sorry to leave Sussex ."""
austen#"In some surprise at the familiarity of this question , or at least of the manner in which it was spoken , Elinor replied that she was . "" Norland is a prodigious beautiful place , is not it ?"" added Miss Steele . "" We have heard Sir John admire it excessively ,"" said Lucy , who seemed to think some apology necessary for the freedom of her sister . "" I think every one MUST admire it ,"" replied Elinor , "" who ever saw the place ; though it is not to be supposed that any one can estimate its beauties as we do ."" "" And had you a great many smart beaux there ?"
austen#"I suppose you have not so many in this part of the world ; for my part , I think they are a vast addition always ."" "" But why should you think ,"" said Lucy , looking ashamed of her sister , "" that there are not as many genteel young men in Devonshire as Sussex ?"" "" Nay , my dear , I ' m sure I don ' t pretend to say that there an ' t . I ' m sure there ' s a vast many smart beaux in Exeter ; but you know , how could I tell what smart beaux there might be about Norland ; and I was only afraid the Miss Dashwoods might find it dull at Barton , if they had not so many as they used to have . But perhaps you young ladies may not care about the beaux , and had as lief be without them as with them . For my part , I think they are vastly agreeable , provided they dress smart and behave civil ."
austen#"But I can ' t bear to see them dirty and nasty . Now there ' s Mr . Rose at Exeter , a prodigious smart young man , quite a beau , clerk to Mr . Simpson , you know , and yet if you do but meet him of a morning , he is not fit to be seen .-- I suppose your brother was quite a beau , Miss Dashwood , before he married , as he was so rich ?"" "" Upon my word ,"" replied Elinor , "" I cannot tell you , for I do not perfectly comprehend the meaning of the word . But this I can say , that if he ever was a beau before he married , he is one still for there is not the smallest alteration in him ."" "" Oh ! dear !"
austen#"one never thinks of married men ' s being beaux -- they have something else to do ."" "" Lord ! Anne ,"" cried her sister , "" you can talk of nothing but beaux ;-- you will make Miss Dashwood believe you think of nothing else ."" And then to turn the discourse , she began admiring the house and the furniture . This specimen of the Miss Steeles was enough . The vulgar freedom and folly of the eldest left her no recommendation , and as Elinor was not blinded by the beauty , or the shrewd look of the youngest , to her want of real elegance and artlessness , she left the house without any wish of knowing them better ."
austen#"Not so the Miss Steeles .-- They came from Exeter , well provided with admiration for the use of Sir John Middleton , his family , and all his relations , and no niggardly proportion was now dealt out to his fair cousins , whom they declared to be the most beautiful , elegant , accomplished , and agreeable girls they had ever beheld , and with whom they were particularly anxious to be better acquainted .-- And to be better acquainted therefore , Elinor soon found was their inevitable lot , for as Sir John was entirely on the side of the Miss Steeles , their party would be too strong for opposition , and that kind of intimacy must be submitted to , which consists of sitting an hour or two together in the same room almost every day . Sir John could do no more ; but he did not know that any more was required : to be together was , in his opinion , to be intimate , and while his continual schemes for their meeting were effectual , he had not a doubt of their being established friends . To do him justice , he did every thing in his power to promote their unreserve , by making the Miss Steeles acquainted with whatever he knew or supposed of his cousins ' situations in the most delicate particulars ,-- and Elinor had not seen them more than twice , before the eldest of them wished her joy on her sister ' s having been so lucky as to make a conquest of a very smart beau since she came to Barton . ""' Twill be a fine thing to have her married so young to be sure ,"" said she , "" and I hear he is quite a beau , and prodigious handsome . And I hope you may have as good luck yourself soon ,-- but perhaps you may have a friend in the corner already ."" Elinor could not suppose that Sir John would be more nice in proclaiming his suspicions of her regard for Edward , than he had been with respect to Marianne ; indeed it was rather his favourite joke of the two , as being somewhat newer and more conjectural ; and since Edward ' s visit , they had never dined together without his drinking to her best affections with so much significancy and so many nods and winks , as to excite general attention ."
austen#"The letter F -- had been likewise invariably brought forward , and found productive of such countless jokes , that its character as the wittiest letter in the alphabet had been long established with Elinor . The Miss Steeles , as she expected , had now all the benefit of these jokes , and in the eldest of them they raised a curiosity to know the name of the gentleman alluded to , which , though often impertinently expressed , was perfectly of a piece with her general inquisitiveness into the concerns of their family . But Sir John did not sport long with the curiosity which he delighted to raise , for he had at least as much pleasure in telling the name , as Miss Steele had in hearing it . "" His name is Ferrars ,"" said he , in a very audible whisper ; "" but pray do not tell it , for it ' s a great secret ."" "" Ferrars !"" repeated Miss Steele ; "" Mr . Ferrars is the happy man , is he ?"
austen#"What ! your sister - in - law ' s brother , Miss Dashwood ? a very agreeable young man to be sure ; I know him very well ."" "" How can you say so , Anne ?"" cried Lucy , who generally made an amendment to all her sister ' s assertions . "" Though we have seen him once or twice at my uncle ' s , it is rather too much to pretend to know him very well ."""
austen#"Elinor heard all this with attention and surprise . "" And who was this uncle ? Where did he live ? How came they acquainted ?"" She wished very much to have the subject continued , though she did not chuse to join in it herself ; but nothing more of it was said , and for the first time in her life , she thought Mrs . Jennings deficient either in curiosity after petty information , or in a disposition to communicate it . The manner in which Miss Steele had spoken of Edward , increased her curiosity ; for it struck her as being rather ill - natured , and suggested the suspicion of that lady ' s knowing , or fancying herself to know something to his disadvantage .-- But her curiosity was unavailing , for no farther notice was taken of Mr . Ferrars ' s name by Miss Steele when alluded to , or even openly mentioned by Sir John ."
austen#"CHAPTER 22 Marianne , who had never much toleration for any thing like impertinence , vulgarity , inferiority of parts , or even difference of taste from herself , was at this time particularly ill - disposed , from the state of her spirits , to be pleased with the Miss Steeles , or to encourage their advances ; and to the invariable coldness of her behaviour towards them , which checked every endeavour at intimacy on their side , Elinor principally attributed that preference of herself which soon became evident in the manners of both , but especially of Lucy , who missed no opportunity of engaging her in conversation , or of striving to improve their acquaintance by an easy and frank communication of her sentiments . Lucy was naturally clever ; her remarks were often just and amusing ; and as a companion for half an hour Elinor frequently found her agreeable ; but her powers had received no aid from education : she was ignorant and illiterate ; and her deficiency of all mental improvement , her want of information in the most common particulars , could not be concealed from Miss Dashwood , in spite of her constant endeavour to appear to advantage . Elinor saw , and pitied her for , the neglect of abilities which education might have rendered so respectable ; but she saw , with less tenderness of feeling , the thorough want of delicacy , of rectitude , and integrity of mind , which her attentions , her assiduities , her flatteries at the Park betrayed ; and she could have no lasting satisfaction in the company of a person who joined insincerity with ignorance ; whose want of instruction prevented their meeting in conversation on terms of equality , and whose conduct toward others made every shew of attention and deference towards herself perfectly valueless . "" You will think my question an odd one , I dare say ,"" said Lucy to her one day , as they were walking together from the park to the cottage --"" but pray , are you personally acquainted with your sister - in - law ' s mother , Mrs . Ferrars ?"""
austen#"Elinor DID think the question a very odd one , and her countenance expressed it , as she answered that she had never seen Mrs . Ferrars . "" Indeed !"" replied Lucy ; "" I wonder at that , for I thought you must have seen her at Norland sometimes . Then , perhaps , you cannot tell me what sort of a woman she is ?"" "" No ,"" returned Elinor , cautious of giving her real opinion of Edward ' s mother , and not very desirous of satisfying what seemed impertinent curiosity -- "" I know nothing of her ."" "" I am sure you think me very strange , for enquiring about her in such a way ,"" said Lucy , eyeing Elinor attentively as she spoke ; "" but perhaps there may be reasons -- I wish I might venture ; but however I hope you will do me the justice of believing that I do not mean to be impertinent ."""
austen#"Elinor made her a civil reply , and they walked on for a few minutes in silence . It was broken by Lucy , who renewed the subject again by saying , with some hesitation , "" I cannot bear to have you think me impertinently curious . I am sure I would rather do any thing in the world than be thought so by a person whose good opinion is so well worth having as yours . And I am sure I should not have the smallest fear of trusting YOU ; indeed , I should be very glad of your advice how to manage in such and uncomfortable situation as I am ; but , however , there is no occasion to trouble YOU . I am sorry you do not happen to know Mrs ."
austen#"Ferrars ."" "" I am sorry I do NOT ,"" said Elinor , in great astonishment , "" if it could be of any use to YOU to know my opinion of her . But really I never understood that you were at all connected with that family , and therefore I am a little surprised , I confess , at so serious an inquiry into her character ."" "" I dare say you are , and I am sure I do not at all wonder at it . But if I dared tell you all , you would not be so much surprised . Mrs . Ferrars is certainly nothing to me at present -- but the time MAY come -- how soon it will come must depend upon herself -- when we may be very intimately connected ."""
austen#"She looked down as she said this , amiably bashful , with only one side glance at her companion to observe its effect on her . "" Good heavens !"" cried Elinor , "" what do you mean ? Are you acquainted with Mr . Robert Ferrars ? Can you be ?"" And she did not feel much delighted with the idea of such a sister - in - law ."
austen#""" No ,"" replied Lucy , "" not to Mr . ROBERT Ferrars -- I never saw him in my life ; but ,"" fixing her eyes upon Elinor , "" to his eldest brother ."" What felt Elinor at that moment ? Astonishment , that would have been as painful as it was strong , had not an immediate disbelief of the assertion attended it . She turned towards Lucy in silent amazement , unable to divine the reason or object of such a declaration ; and though her complexion varied , she stood firm in incredulity , and felt in no danger of an hysterical fit , or a swoon . "" You may well be surprised ,"" continued Lucy ; "" for to be sure you could have had no idea of it before ; for I dare say he never dropped the smallest hint of it to you or any of your family ; because it was always meant to be a great secret , and I am sure has been faithfully kept so by me to this hour . Not a soul of all my relations know of it but Anne , and I never should have mentioned it to you , if I had not felt the greatest dependence in the world upon your secrecy ; and I really thought my behaviour in asking so many questions about Mrs . Ferrars must seem so odd , that it ought to be explained ."
austen#"And I do not think Mr . Ferrars can be displeased , when he knows I have trusted you , because I know he has the highest opinion in the world of all your family , and looks upon yourself and the other Miss Dashwoods quite as his own sisters ."" -- She paused . Elinor for a few moments remained silent . Her astonishment at what she heard was at first too great for words ; but at length forcing herself to speak , and to speak cautiously , she said , with calmness of manner , which tolerably well concealed her surprise and solicitude -- "" May I ask if your engagement is of long standing ?"" "" We have been engaged these four years ."" "" Four years !"""
austen#""" Yes ."" Elinor , though greatly shocked , still felt unable to believe it . "" I did not know ,"" said she , "" that you were even acquainted till the other day ."" "" Our acquaintance , however , is of many years date . He was under my uncle ' s care , you know , a considerable while ."" "" Your uncle !"""
austen#""" Yes ; Mr . Pratt . Did you never hear him talk of Mr . Pratt ?"" "" I think I have ,"" replied Elinor , with an exertion of spirits , which increased with her increase of emotion . "" He was four years with my uncle , who lives at Longstaple , near Plymouth . It was there our acquaintance begun , for my sister and me was often staying with my uncle , and it was there our engagement was formed , though not till a year after he had quitted as a pupil ; but he was almost always with us afterwards ."
austen#"I was very unwilling to enter into it , as you may imagine , without the knowledge and approbation of his mother ; but I was too young , and loved him too well , to be so prudent as I ought to have been .-- Though you do not know him so well as me , Miss Dashwood , you must have seen enough of him to be sensible he is very capable of making a woman sincerely attached to him ."" "" Certainly ,"" answered Elinor , without knowing what she said ; but after a moment ' s reflection , she added , with revived security of Edward ' s honour and love , and her companion ' s falsehood --"" Engaged to Mr . Edward Ferrars !-- I confess myself so totally surprised at what you tell me , that really -- I beg your pardon ; but surely there must be some mistake of person or name . We cannot mean the same Mr . Ferrars ."" "" We can mean no other ,"" cried Lucy , smiling . "" Mr . Edward Ferrars , the eldest son of Mrs . Ferrars , of Park Street , and brother of your sister - in - law , Mrs . John Dashwood , is the person I mean ; you must allow that I am not likely to be deceived as to the name of the man on who all my happiness depends ."""
austen#""" It is strange ,"" replied Elinor , in a most painful perplexity , "" that I should never have heard him even mention your name ."" "" No ; considering our situation , it was not strange . Our first care has been to keep the matter secret .-- You knew nothing of me , or my family , and , therefore , there could be no OCCASION for ever mentioning my name to you ; and , as he was always particularly afraid of his sister ' s suspecting any thing , THAT was reason enough for his not mentioning it ."" She was silent .-- Elinor ' s security sunk ; but her self - command did not sink with it . "" Four years you have been engaged ,"" said she with a firm voice . "" Yes ; and heaven knows how much longer we may have to wait ."
austen#"Poor Edward ! It puts him quite out of heart ."" Then taking a small miniature from her pocket , she added , "" To prevent the possibility of mistake , be so good as to look at this face . It does not do him justice , to be sure , but yet I think you cannot be deceived as to the person it was drew for .-- I have had it above these three years ."" She put it into her hands as she spoke ; and when Elinor saw the painting , whatever other doubts her fear of a too hasty decision , or her wish of detecting falsehood might suffer to linger in her mind , she could have none of its being Edward ' s face . She returned it almost instantly , acknowledging the likeness ."
austen#""" I have never been able ,"" continued Lucy , "" to give him my picture in return , which I am very much vexed at , for he has been always so anxious to get it ! But I am determined to set for it the very first opportunity ."" "" You are quite in the right ,"" replied Elinor calmly . They then proceeded a few paces in silence . Lucy spoke first . "" I am sure ,"" said she , "" I have no doubt in the world of your faithfully keeping this secret , because you must know of what importance it is to us , not to have it reach his mother ; for she would never approve of it , I dare say ."
austen#"I shall have no fortune , and I fancy she is an exceeding proud woman ."" "" I certainly did not seek your confidence ,"" said Elinor ; "" but you do me no more than justice in imagining that I may be depended on . Your secret is safe with me ; but pardon me if I express some surprise at so unnecessary a communication . You must at least have felt that my being acquainted with it could not add to its safety ."" As she said this , she looked earnestly at Lucy , hoping to discover something in her countenance ; perhaps the falsehood of the greatest part of what she had been saying ; but Lucy ' s countenance suffered no change . "" I was afraid you would think I was taking a great liberty with you ,"" said she , "" in telling you all this ."
austen#I have not known you long to be sure , personally at least , but I have known you and all your family by description a great while ; and as soon as I saw you , I felt almost as if you was an old acquaintance . Besides in the present case , I really thought some explanation was due to you after my making such particular inquiries about Edward ' s mother ; and I am so unfortunate , that I have not a creature whose advice I can ask . Anne is the only person that knows of it , and she has no judgment at all ; indeed , she does me a great deal more harm than good , for I am in constant fear of her betraying me . She does not know how to hold her tongue , as you must perceive , and I am sure I was in the greatest fright in the world t ' other day , when Edward ' s name was mentioned by Sir John , lest she should out with it all . You can ' t think how much I go through in my mind from it altogether . I only wonder that I am alive after what I have suffered for Edward ' s sake these last four years .
austen#"Every thing in such suspense and uncertainty ; and seeing him so seldom -- we can hardly meet above twice a - year . I am sure I wonder my heart is not quite broke ."" Here she took out her handkerchief ; but Elinor did not feel very compassionate . "" Sometimes ."" continued Lucy , after wiping her eyes , "" I think whether it would not be better for us both to break off the matter entirely ."" As she said this , she looked directly at her companion ."
austen#""" But then at other times I have not resolution enough for it .-- I cannot bear the thoughts of making him so miserable , as I know the very mention of such a thing would do . And on my own account too -- so dear as he is to me -- I don ' t think I could be equal to it . What would you advise me to do in such a case , Miss Dashwood ? What would you do yourself ?"" "" Pardon me ,"" replied Elinor , startled by the question ; "" but I can give you no advice under such circumstances . Your own judgment must direct you ."""
austen#""" To be sure ,"" continued Lucy , after a few minutes silence on both sides , "" his mother must provide for him sometime or other ; but poor Edward is so cast down by it ! Did you not think him dreadful low - spirited when he was at Barton ? He was so miserable when he left us at Longstaple , to go to you , that I was afraid you would think him quite ill ."" "" Did he come from your uncle ' s , then , when he visited us ?"" "" Oh , yes ; he had been staying a fortnight with us . Did you think he came directly from town ?"""
austen#""" No ,"" replied Elinor , most feelingly sensible of every fresh circumstance in favour of Lucy ' s veracity ; "" I remember he told us , that he had been staying a fortnight with some friends near Plymouth ."" She remembered too , her own surprise at the time , at his mentioning nothing farther of those friends , at his total silence with respect even to their names . "" Did not you think him sadly out of spirits ?"" repeated Lucy . "" We did , indeed , particularly so when he first arrived ."" "" I begged him to exert himself for fear you should suspect what was the matter ; but it made him so melancholy , not being able to stay more than a fortnight with us , and seeing me so much affected .-- Poor fellow !-- I am afraid it is just the same with him now ; for he writes in wretched spirits ."
austen#"I heard from him just before I left Exeter ;"" taking a letter from her pocket and carelessly showing the direction to Elinor . "" You know his hand , I dare say , a charming one it is ; but that is not written so well as usual .-- He was tired , I dare say , for he had just filled the sheet to me as full as possible ."" Elinor saw that it WAS his hand , and she could doubt no longer . This picture , she had allowed herself to believe , might have been accidentally obtained ; it might not have been Edward ' s gift ; but a correspondence between them by letter , could subsist only under a positive engagement , could be authorised by nothing else ; for a few moments , she was almost overcome -- her heart sunk within her , and she could hardly stand ; but exertion was indispensably necessary ; and she struggled so resolutely against the oppression of her feelings , that her success was speedy , and for the time complete . "" Writing to each other ,"" said Lucy , returning the letter into her pocket , "" is the only comfort we have in such long separations . Yes , I have one other comfort in his picture , but poor Edward has not even THAT ."
austen#"If he had but my picture , he says he should be easy . I gave him a lock of my hair set in a ring when he was at Longstaple last , and that was some comfort to him , he said , but not equal to a picture . Perhaps you might notice the ring when you saw him ?"" "" I did ,"" said Elinor , with a composure of voice , under which was concealed an emotion and distress beyond any thing she had ever felt before . She was mortified , shocked , confounded . Fortunately for her , they had now reached the cottage , and the conversation could be continued no farther ."
austen#After sitting with them a few minutes , the Miss Steeles returned to the Park , and Elinor was then at liberty to think and be wretched . [ At this point in the first and second editions , Volume 1 ends .] CHAPTER 23 However small Elinor ' s general dependence on Lucy ' s veracity might be , it was impossible for her on serious reflection to suspect it in the present case , where no temptation could be answerable to the folly of inventing a falsehood of such a description . What Lucy had asserted to be true , therefore , Elinor could not , dared not longer doubt ; supported as it was too on every side by such probabilities and proofs , and contradicted by nothing but her own wishes . Their opportunity of acquaintance in the house of Mr . Pratt was a foundation for the rest , at once indisputable and alarming ; and Edward ' s visit near Plymouth , his melancholy state of mind , his dissatisfaction at his own prospects , his uncertain behaviour towards herself , the intimate knowledge of the Miss Steeles as to Norland and their family connections , which had often surprised her , the picture , the letter , the ring , formed altogether such a body of evidence , as overcame every fear of condemning him unfairly , and established as a fact , which no partiality could set aside , his ill - treatment of herself .-- Her resentment of such behaviour , her indignation at having been its dupe , for a short time made her feel only for herself ; but other ideas , other considerations , soon arose .
austen#Had Edward been intentionally deceiving her ? Had he feigned a regard for her which he did not feel ? Was his engagement to Lucy an engagement of the heart ? No ; whatever it might once have been , she could not believe it such at present . His affection was all her own . She could not be deceived in that .
austen#Her mother , sisters , Fanny , all had been conscious of his regard for her at Norland ; it was not an illusion of her own vanity . He certainly loved her . What a softener of the heart was this persuasion ! How much could it not tempt her to forgive ! He had been blamable , highly blamable , in remaining at Norland after he first felt her influence over him to be more than it ought to be . In that , he could not be defended ; but if he had injured her , how much more had he injured himself ; if her case were pitiable , his was hopeless .
austen#His imprudence had made her miserable for a while ; but it seemed to have deprived himself of all chance of ever being otherwise . She might in time regain tranquillity ; but HE , what had he to look forward to ? Could he ever be tolerably happy with Lucy Steele ; could he , were his affection for herself out of the question , with his integrity , his delicacy , and well - informed mind , be satisfied with a wife like her -- illiterate , artful , and selfish ? The youthful infatuation of nineteen would naturally blind him to every thing but her beauty and good nature ; but the four succeeding years -- years , which if rationally spent , give such improvement to the understanding , must have opened his eyes to her defects of education , while the same period of time , spent on her side in inferior society and more frivolous pursuits , had perhaps robbed her of that simplicity which might once have given an interesting character to her beauty . If in the supposition of his seeking to marry herself , his difficulties from his mother had seemed great , how much greater were they now likely to be , when the object of his engagement was undoubtedly inferior in connections , and probably inferior in fortune to herself . These difficulties , indeed , with a heart so alienated from Lucy , might not press very hard upon his patience ; but melancholy was the state of the person by whom the expectation of family opposition and unkindness , could be felt as a relief !
austen#As these considerations occurred to her in painful succession , she wept for him , more than for herself . Supported by the conviction of having done nothing to merit her present unhappiness , and consoled by the belief that Edward had done nothing to forfeit her esteem , she thought she could even now , under the first smart of the heavy blow , command herself enough to guard every suspicion of the truth from her mother and sisters . And so well was she able to answer her own expectations , that when she joined them at dinner only two hours after she had first suffered the extinction of all her dearest hopes , no one would have supposed from the appearance of the sisters , that Elinor was mourning in secret over obstacles which must divide her for ever from the object of her love , and that Marianne was internally dwelling on the perfections of a man , of whose whole heart she felt thoroughly possessed , and whom she expected to see in every carriage which drove near their house . The necessity of concealing from her mother and Marianne , what had been entrusted in confidence to herself , though it obliged her to unceasing exertion , was no aggravation of Elinor ' s distress . On the contrary it was a relief to her , to be spared the communication of what would give such affliction to them , and to be saved likewise from hearing that condemnation of Edward , which would probably flow from the excess of their partial affection for herself , and which was more than she felt equal to support . From their counsel , or their conversation , she knew she could receive no assistance , their tenderness and sorrow must add to her distress , while her self - command would neither receive encouragement from their example nor from their praise .
austen#She was stronger alone , and her own good sense so well supported her , that her firmness was as unshaken , her appearance of cheerfulness as invariable , as with regrets so poignant and so fresh , it was possible for them to be . Much as she had suffered from her first conversation with Lucy on the subject , she soon felt an earnest wish of renewing it ; and this for more reasons than one . She wanted to hear many particulars of their engagement repeated again , she wanted more clearly to understand what Lucy really felt for Edward , whether there were any sincerity in her declaration of tender regard for him , and she particularly wanted to convince Lucy , by her readiness to enter on the matter again , and her calmness in conversing on it , that she was no otherwise interested in it than as a friend , which she very much feared her involuntary agitation , in their morning discourse , must have left at least doubtful . That Lucy was disposed to be jealous of her appeared very probable : it was plain that Edward had always spoken highly in her praise , not merely from Lucy ' s assertion , but from her venturing to trust her on so short a personal acquaintance , with a secret so confessedly and evidently important . And even Sir John ' s joking intelligence must have had some weight . But indeed , while Elinor remained so well assured within herself of being really beloved by Edward , it required no other consideration of probabilities to make it natural that Lucy should be jealous ; and that she was so , her very confidence was a proof .
austen#What other reason for the disclosure of the affair could there be , but that Elinor might be informed by it of Lucy ' s superior claims on Edward , and be taught to avoid him in future ? She had little difficulty in understanding thus much of her rival ' s intentions , and while she was firmly resolved to act by her as every principle of honour and honesty directed , to combat her own affection for Edward and to see him as little as possible ; she could not deny herself the comfort of endeavouring to convince Lucy that her heart was unwounded . And as she could now have nothing more painful to hear on the subject than had already been told , she did not mistrust her own ability of going through a repetition of particulars with composure . But it was not immediately that an opportunity of doing so could be commanded , though Lucy was as well disposed as herself to take advantage of any that occurred ; for the weather was not often fine enough to allow of their joining in a walk , where they might most easily separate themselves from the others ; and though they met at least every other evening either at the park or cottage , and chiefly at the former , they could not be supposed to meet for the sake of conversation . Such a thought would never enter either Sir John or Lady Middleton ' s head ; and therefore very little leisure was ever given for a general chat , and none at all for particular discourse . They met for the sake of eating , drinking , and laughing together , playing at cards , or consequences , or any other game that was sufficiently noisy .
austen#One or two meetings of this kind had taken place , without affording Elinor any chance of engaging Lucy in private , when Sir John called at the cottage one morning , to beg , in the name of charity , that they would all dine with Lady Middleton that day , as he was obliged to attend the club at Exeter , and she would otherwise be quite alone , except her mother and the two Miss Steeles . Elinor , who foresaw a fairer opening for the point she had in view , in such a party as this was likely to be , more at liberty among themselves under the tranquil and well - bred direction of Lady Middleton than when her husband united them together in one noisy purpose , immediately accepted the invitation ; Margaret , with her mother ' s permission , was equally compliant , and Marianne , though always unwilling to join any of their parties , was persuaded by her mother , who could not bear to have her seclude herself from any chance of amusement , to go likewise . The young ladies went , and Lady Middleton was happily preserved from the frightful solitude which had threatened her . The insipidity of the meeting was exactly such as Elinor had expected ; it produced not one novelty of thought or expression , and nothing could be less interesting than the whole of their discourse both in the dining parlour and drawing room : to the latter , the children accompanied them , and while they remained there , she was too well convinced of the impossibility of engaging Lucy ' s attention to attempt it . They quitted it only with the removal of the tea - things . The card - table was then placed , and Elinor began to wonder at herself for having ever entertained a hope of finding time for conversation at the park .
austen#"They all rose up in preparation for a round game . "" I am glad ,"" said Lady Middleton to Lucy , "" you are not going to finish poor little Annamaria ' s basket this evening ; for I am sure it must hurt your eyes to work filigree by candlelight . And we will make the dear little love some amends for her disappointment to - morrow , and then I hope she will not much mind it ."" This hint was enough , Lucy recollected herself instantly and replied , "" Indeed you are very much mistaken , Lady Middleton ; I am only waiting to know whether you can make your party without me , or I should have been at my filigree already . I would not disappoint the little angel for all the world : and if you want me at the card - table now , I am resolved to finish the basket after supper ."" "" You are very good , I hope it won ' t hurt your eyes -- will you ring the bell for some working candles ?"
austen#"My poor little girl would be sadly disappointed , I know , if the basket was not finished tomorrow , for though I told her it certainly would not , I am sure she depends upon having it done ."" Lucy directly drew her work table near her and reseated herself with an alacrity and cheerfulness which seemed to infer that she could taste no greater delight than in making a filigree basket for a spoilt child . Lady Middleton proposed a rubber of Casino to the others . No one made any objection but Marianne , who with her usual inattention to the forms of general civility , exclaimed , "" Your Ladyship will have the goodness to excuse ME -- you know I detest cards . I shall go to the piano - forte ; I have not touched it since it was tuned ."" And without farther ceremony , she turned away and walked to the instrument ."
austen#"Lady Middleton looked as if she thanked heaven that SHE had never made so rude a speech . "" Marianne can never keep long from that instrument you know , ma ' am ,"" said Elinor , endeavouring to smooth away the offence ; "" and I do not much wonder at it ; for it is the very best toned piano - forte I ever heard ."" The remaining five were now to draw their cards . "" Perhaps ,"" continued Elinor , "" if I should happen to cut out , I may be of some use to Miss Lucy Steele , in rolling her papers for her ; and there is so much still to be done to the basket , that it must be impossible I think for her labour singly , to finish it this evening . I should like the work exceedingly , if she would allow me a share in it ."" "" Indeed I shall be very much obliged to you for your help ,"" cried Lucy , "" for I find there is more to be done to it than I thought there was ; and it would be a shocking thing to disappoint dear Annamaria after all ."""
austen#""" Oh ! that would be terrible , indeed ,"" said Miss Steele -- "" Dear little soul , how I do love her !"" "" You are very kind ,"" said Lady Middleton to Elinor ; "" and as you really like the work , perhaps you will be as well pleased not to cut in till another rubber , or will you take your chance now ?"" Elinor joyfully profited by the first of these proposals , and thus by a little of that address which Marianne could never condescend to practise , gained her own end , and pleased Lady Middleton at the same time . Lucy made room for her with ready attention , and the two fair rivals were thus seated side by side at the same table , and , with the utmost harmony , engaged in forwarding the same work . The pianoforte at which Marianne , wrapped up in her own music and her own thoughts , had by this time forgotten that any body was in the room besides herself , was luckily so near them that Miss Dashwood now judged she might safely , under the shelter of its noise , introduce the interesting subject , without any risk of being heard at the card - table ."
austen#"CHAPTER 24 In a firm , though cautious tone , Elinor thus began . "" I should be undeserving of the confidence you have honoured me with , if I felt no desire for its continuance , or no farther curiosity on its subject . I will not apologize therefore for bringing it forward again ."" "" Thank you ,"" cried Lucy warmly , "" for breaking the ice ; you have set my heart at ease by it ; for I was somehow or other afraid I had offended you by what I told you that Monday ."" "" Offended me !"
austen#"How could you suppose so ? Believe me ,"" and Elinor spoke it with the truest sincerity , "" nothing could be farther from my intention than to give you such an idea . Could you have a motive for the trust , that was not honourable and flattering to me ?"" "" And yet I do assure you ,"" replied Lucy , her little sharp eyes full of meaning , "" there seemed to me to be a coldness and displeasure in your manner that made me quite uncomfortable . I felt sure that you was angry with me ; and have been quarrelling with myself ever since , for having took such a liberty as to trouble you with my affairs . But I am very glad to find it was only my own fancy , and that you really do not blame me ."
austen#"If you knew what a consolation it was to me to relieve my heart speaking to you of what I am always thinking of every moment of my life , your compassion would make you overlook every thing else I am sure ."" "" Indeed , I can easily believe that it was a very great relief to you , to acknowledge your situation to me , and be assured that you shall never have reason to repent it . Your case is a very unfortunate one ; you seem to me to be surrounded with difficulties , and you will have need of all your mutual affection to support you under them . Mr . Ferrars , I believe , is entirely dependent on his mother ."" "" He has only two thousand pounds of his own ; it would be madness to marry upon that , though for my own part , I could give up every prospect of more without a sigh . I have been always used to a very small income , and could struggle with any poverty for him ; but I love him too well to be the selfish means of robbing him , perhaps , of all that his mother might give him if he married to please her ."
austen#"We must wait , it may be for many years . With almost every other man in the world , it would be an alarming prospect ; but Edward ' s affection and constancy nothing can deprive me of I know ."" "" That conviction must be every thing to you ; and he is undoubtedly supported by the same trust in your ' s . If the strength of your reciprocal attachment had failed , as between many people , and under many circumstances it naturally would during a four years ' engagement , your situation would have been pitiable , indeed ."" Lucy here looked up ; but Elinor was careful in guarding her countenance from every expression that could give her words a suspicious tendency . "" Edward ' s love for me ,"" said Lucy , "" has been pretty well put to the test , by our long , very long absence since we were first engaged , and it has stood the trial so well , that I should be unpardonable to doubt it now ."
austen#"I can safely say that he has never gave me one moment ' s alarm on that account from the first ."" Elinor hardly knew whether to smile or sigh at this assertion . Lucy went on . "" I am rather of a jealous temper too by nature , and from our different situations in life , from his being so much more in the world than me , and our continual separation , I was enough inclined for suspicion , to have found out the truth in an instant , if there had been the slightest alteration in his behaviour to me when we met , or any lowness of spirits that I could not account for , or if he had talked more of one lady than another , or seemed in any respect less happy at Longstaple than he used to be . I do not mean to say that I am particularly observant or quick - sighted in general , but in such a case I am sure I could not be deceived ."" "" All this ,"" thought Elinor , "" is very pretty ; but it can impose upon neither of us ."""
austen#""" But what ,"" said she after a short silence , "" are your views ? or have you none but that of waiting for Mrs . Ferrars ' s death , which is a melancholy and shocking extremity ?-- Is her son determined to submit to this , and to all the tediousness of the many years of suspense in which it may involve you , rather than run the risk of her displeasure for a while by owning the truth ?"" "" If we could be certain that it would be only for a while ! But Mrs . Ferrars is a very headstrong proud woman , and in her first fit of anger upon hearing it , would very likely secure every thing to Robert , and the idea of that , for Edward ' s sake , frightens away all my inclination for hasty measures ."" "" And for your own sake too , or you are carrying your disinterestedness beyond reason ."" Lucy looked at Elinor again , and was silent ."
austen#""" Do you know Mr . Robert Ferrars ?"" asked Elinor . "" Not at all -- I never saw him ; but I fancy he is very unlike his brother -- silly and a great coxcomb ."" "" A great coxcomb !"" repeated Miss Steele , whose ear had caught those words by a sudden pause in Marianne ' s music .-- "" Oh , they are talking of their favourite beaux , I dare say ."" "" No sister ,"" cried Lucy , "" you are mistaken there , our favourite beaux are NOT great coxcombs ."""
austen#""" I can answer for it that Miss Dashwood ' s is not ,"" said Mrs . Jennings , laughing heartily ; "" for he is one of the modestest , prettiest behaved young men I ever saw ; but as for Lucy , she is such a sly little creature , there is no finding out who SHE likes ."" "" Oh ,"" cried Miss Steele , looking significantly round at them , "" I dare say Lucy ' s beau is quite as modest and pretty behaved as Miss Dashwood ' s ."" Elinor blushed in spite of herself . Lucy bit her lip , and looked angrily at her sister . A mutual silence took place for some time . Lucy first put an end to it by saying in a lower tone , though Marianne was then giving them the powerful protection of a very magnificent concerto --"
austen#""" I will honestly tell you of one scheme which has lately come into my head , for bringing matters to bear ; indeed I am bound to let you into the secret , for you are a party concerned . I dare say you have seen enough of Edward to know that he would prefer the church to every other profession ; now my plan is that he should take orders as soon as he can , and then through your interest , which I am sure you would be kind enough to use out of friendship for him , and I hope out of some regard to me , your brother might be persuaded to give him Norland living ; which I understand is a very good one , and the present incumbent not likely to live a great while . That would be enough for us to marry upon , and we might trust to time and chance for the rest ."" "" I should always be happy ,"" replied Elinor , "" to show any mark of my esteem and friendship for Mr . Ferrars ; but do you not perceive that my interest on such an occasion would be perfectly unnecessary ? He is brother to Mrs . John Dashwood -- THAT must be recommendation enough to her husband ."" "" But Mrs . John Dashwood would not much approve of Edward ' s going into orders ."""
austen#""" Then I rather suspect that my interest would do very little ."" They were again silent for many minutes . At length Lucy exclaimed with a deep sigh , "" I believe it would be the wisest way to put an end to the business at once by dissolving the engagement . We seem so beset with difficulties on every side , that though it would make us miserable for a time , we should be happier perhaps in the end . But you will not give me your advice , Miss Dashwood ?"""
austen#""" No ,"" answered Elinor , with a smile , which concealed very agitated feelings , "" on such a subject I certainly will not . You know very well that my opinion would have no weight with you , unless it were on the side of your wishes ."" "" Indeed you wrong me ,"" replied Lucy , with great solemnity ; "" I know nobody of whose judgment I think so highly as I do of yours ; and I do really believe , that if you was to say to me , ' I advise you by all means to put an end to your engagement with Edward Ferrars , it will be more for the happiness of both of you ,' I should resolve upon doing it immediately ."" Elinor blushed for the insincerity of Edward ' s future wife , and replied , "" This compliment would effectually frighten me from giving any opinion on the subject had I formed one . It raises my influence much too high ; the power of dividing two people so tenderly attached is too much for an indifferent person ."" ""' Tis because you are an indifferent person ,"" said Lucy , with some pique , and laying a particular stress on those words , "" that your judgment might justly have such weight with me ."
austen#"If you could be supposed to be biased in any respect by your own feelings , your opinion would not be worth having ."" Elinor thought it wisest to make no answer to this , lest they might provoke each other to an unsuitable increase of ease and unreserve ; and was even partly determined never to mention the subject again . Another pause therefore of many minutes ' duration , succeeded this speech , and Lucy was still the first to end it . "" Shall you be in town this winter , Miss Dashwood ?"" said she with all her accustomary complacency . "" Certainly not ."""
austen#""" I am sorry for that ,"" returned the other , while her eyes brightened at the information , "" it would have gave me such pleasure to meet you there ! But I dare say you will go for all that . To be sure , your brother and sister will ask you to come to them ."" "" It will not be in my power to accept their invitation if they do ."" "" How unlucky that is ! I had quite depended upon meeting you there ."
austen#"Anne and me are to go the latter end of January to some relations who have been wanting us to visit them these several years ! But I only go for the sake of seeing Edward . He will be there in February , otherwise London would have no charms for me ; I have not spirits for it ."" Elinor was soon called to the card - table by the conclusion of the first rubber , and the confidential discourse of the two ladies was therefore at an end , to which both of them submitted without any reluctance , for nothing had been said on either side to make them dislike each other less than they had done before ; and Elinor sat down to the card table with the melancholy persuasion that Edward was not only without affection for the person who was to be his wife ; but that he had not even the chance of being tolerably happy in marriage , which sincere affection on HER side would have given , for self - interest alone could induce a woman to keep a man to an engagement , of which she seemed so thoroughly aware that he was weary . From this time the subject was never revived by Elinor , and when entered on by Lucy , who seldom missed an opportunity of introducing it , and was particularly careful to inform her confidante , of her happiness whenever she received a letter from Edward , it was treated by the former with calmness and caution , and dismissed as soon as civility would allow ; for she felt such conversations to be an indulgence which Lucy did not deserve , and which were dangerous to herself . The visit of the Miss Steeles at Barton Park was lengthened far beyond what the first invitation implied ."
austen#Their favour increased ; they could not be spared ; Sir John would not hear of their going ; and in spite of their numerous and long arranged engagements in Exeter , in spite of the absolute necessity of returning to fulfill them immediately , which was in full force at the end of every week , they were prevailed on to stay nearly two months at the park , and to assist in the due celebration of that festival which requires a more than ordinary share of private balls and large dinners to proclaim its importance . CHAPTER 25 Though Mrs . Jennings was in the habit of spending a large portion of the year at the houses of her children and friends , she was not without a settled habitation of her own . Since the death of her husband , who had traded with success in a less elegant part of the town , she had resided every winter in a house in one of the streets near Portman Square . Towards this home , she began on the approach of January to turn her thoughts , and thither she one day abruptly , and very unexpectedly by them , asked the elder Misses Dashwood to accompany her . Elinor , without observing the varying complexion of her sister , and the animated look which spoke no indifference to the plan , immediately gave a grateful but absolute denial for both , in which she believed herself to be speaking their united inclinations .
austen#"The reason alleged was their determined resolution of not leaving their mother at that time of the year . Mrs . Jennings received the refusal with some surprise , and repeated her invitation immediately . "" Oh , Lord ! I am sure your mother can spare you very well , and I DO beg you will favour me with your company , for I ' ve quite set my heart upon it . Don ' t fancy that you will be any inconvenience to me , for I shan ' t put myself at all out of my way for you . It will only be sending Betty by the coach , and I hope I can afford THAT ."
austen#"We three shall be able to go very well in my chaise ; and when we are in town , if you do not like to go wherever I do , well and good , you may always go with one of my daughters . I am sure your mother will not object to it ; for I have had such good luck in getting my own children off my hands that she will think me a very fit person to have the charge of you ; and if I don ' t get one of you at least well married before I have done with you , it shall not be my fault . I shall speak a good word for you to all the young men , you may depend upon it ."" "" I have a notion ,"" said Sir John , "" that Miss Marianne would not object to such a scheme , if her elder sister would come into it . It is very hard indeed that she should not have a little pleasure , because Miss Dashwood does not wish it . So I would advise you two , to set off for town , when you are tired of Barton , without saying a word to Miss Dashwood about it ."""
austen#""" Nay ,"" cried Mrs . Jennings , "" I am sure I shall be monstrous glad of Miss Marianne ' s company , whether Miss Dashwood will go or not , only the more the merrier say I , and I thought it would be more comfortable for them to be together ; because , if they got tired of me , they might talk to one another , and laugh at my old ways behind my back . But one or the other , if not both of them , I must have . Lord bless me ! how do you think I can live poking by myself , I who have been always used till this winter to have Charlotte with me . Come , Miss Marianne , let us strike hands upon the bargain , and if Miss Dashwood will change her mind by and bye , why so much the better ."" "" I thank you , ma ' am , sincerely thank you ,"" said Marianne , with warmth : "" your invitation has insured my gratitude for ever , and it would give me such happiness , yes , almost the greatest happiness I am capable of , to be able to accept it ."
austen#"But my mother , my dearest , kindest mother ,-- I feel the justice of what Elinor has urged , and if she were to be made less happy , less comfortable by our absence -- Oh ! no , nothing should tempt me to leave her . It should not , must not be a struggle ."" Mrs . Jennings repeated her assurance that Mrs . Dashwood could spare them perfectly well ; and Elinor , who now understood her sister , and saw to what indifference to almost every thing else she was carried by her eagerness to be with Willoughby again , made no farther direct opposition to the plan , and merely referred it to her mother ' s decision , from whom however she scarcely expected to receive any support in her endeavour to prevent a visit , which she could not approve of for Marianne , and which on her own account she had particular reasons to avoid . Whatever Marianne was desirous of , her mother would be eager to promote -- she could not expect to influence the latter to cautiousness of conduct in an affair respecting which she had never been able to inspire her with distrust ; and she dared not explain the motive of her own disinclination for going to London . That Marianne , fastidious as she was , thoroughly acquainted with Mrs . Jennings ' manners , and invariably disgusted by them , should overlook every inconvenience of that kind , should disregard whatever must be most wounding to her irritable feelings , in her pursuit of one object , was such a proof , so strong , so full , of the importance of that object to her , as Elinor , in spite of all that had passed , was not prepared to witness ."
austen#"On being informed of the invitation , Mrs . Dashwood , persuaded that such an excursion would be productive of much amusement to both her daughters , and perceiving through all her affectionate attention to herself , how much the heart of Marianne was in it , would not hear of their declining the offer upon HER account ; insisted on their both accepting it directly ; and then began to foresee , with her usual cheerfulness , a variety of advantages that would accrue to them all , from this separation . "" I am delighted with the plan ,"" she cried , "" it is exactly what I could wish . Margaret and I shall be as much benefited by it as yourselves . When you and the Middletons are gone , we shall go on so quietly and happily together with our books and our music ! You will find Margaret so improved when you come back again ! I have a little plan of alteration for your bedrooms too , which may now be performed without any inconvenience to any one ."
austen#"It is very right that you SHOULD go to town ; I would have every young woman of your condition in life acquainted with the manners and amusements of London . You will be under the care of a motherly good sort of woman , of whose kindness to you I can have no doubt . And in all probability you will see your brother , and whatever may be his faults , or the faults of his wife , when I consider whose son he is , I cannot bear to have you so wholly estranged from each other ."" "" Though with your usual anxiety for our happiness ,"" said Elinor , "" you have been obviating every impediment to the present scheme which occurred to you , there is still one objection which , in my opinion , cannot be so easily removed ."" Marianne ' s countenance sunk . "" And what ,"" said Mrs . Dashwood , "" is my dear prudent Elinor going to suggest ?"
austen#"What formidable obstacle is she now to bring forward ? Do let me hear a word about the expense of it ."" "" My objection is this ; though I think very well of Mrs . Jennings ' s heart , she is not a woman whose society can afford us pleasure , or whose protection will give us consequence ."" "" That is very true ,"" replied her mother , "" but of her society , separately from that of other people , you will scarcely have any thing at all , and you will almost always appear in public with Lady Middleton ."" "" If Elinor is frightened away by her dislike of Mrs . Jennings ,"" said Marianne , "" at least it need not prevent MY accepting her invitation . I have no such scruples , and I am sure I could put up with every unpleasantness of that kind with very little effort ."""
austen#"Elinor could not help smiling at this display of indifference towards the manners of a person , to whom she had often had difficulty in persuading Marianne to behave with tolerable politeness ; and resolved within herself , that if her sister persisted in going , she would go likewise , as she did not think it proper that Marianne should be left to the sole guidance of her own judgment , or that Mrs . Jennings should be abandoned to the mercy of Marianne for all the comfort of her domestic hours . To this determination she was the more easily reconciled , by recollecting that Edward Ferrars , by Lucy ' s account , was not to be in town before February ; and that their visit , without any unreasonable abridgement , might be previously finished . "" I will have you BOTH go ,"" said Mrs . Dashwood ; "" these objections are nonsensical . You will have much pleasure in being in London , and especially in being together ; and if Elinor would ever condescend to anticipate enjoyment , she would foresee it there from a variety of sources ; she would , perhaps , expect some from improving her acquaintance with her sister - in - law ' s family ."" Elinor had often wished for an opportunity of attempting to weaken her mother ' s dependence on the attachment of Edward and herself , that the shock might be less when the whole truth were revealed , and now on this attack , though almost hopeless of success , she forced herself to begin her design by saying , as calmly as she could , "" I like Edward Ferrars very much , and shall always be glad to see him ; but as to the rest of the family , it is a matter of perfect indifference to me , whether I am ever known to them or not ."" Mrs . Dashwood smiled , and said nothing ."
austen#Marianne lifted up her eyes in astonishment , and Elinor conjectured that she might as well have held her tongue . After very little farther discourse , it was finally settled that the invitation should be fully accepted . Mrs . Jennings received the information with a great deal of joy , and many assurances of kindness and care ; nor was it a matter of pleasure merely to her . Sir John was delighted ; for to a man , whose prevailing anxiety was the dread of being alone , the acquisition of two , to the number of inhabitants in London , was something . Even Lady Middleton took the trouble of being delighted , which was putting herself rather out of her way ; and as for the Miss Steeles , especially Lucy , they had never been so happy in their lives as this intelligence made them . Elinor submitted to the arrangement which counteracted her wishes with less reluctance than she had expected to feel .
austen#With regard to herself , it was now a matter of unconcern whether she went to town or not , and when she saw her mother so thoroughly pleased with the plan , and her sister exhilarated by it in look , voice , and manner , restored to all her usual animation , and elevated to more than her usual gaiety , she could not be dissatisfied with the cause , and would hardly allow herself to distrust the consequence . Marianne ' s joy was almost a degree beyond happiness , so great was the perturbation of her spirits and her impatience to be gone . Her unwillingness to quit her mother was her only restorative to calmness ; and at the moment of parting her grief on that score was excessive . Her mother ' s affliction was hardly less , and Elinor was the only one of the three , who seemed to consider the separation as any thing short of eternal . Their departure took place in the first week in January . The Middletons were to follow in about a week .
austen#The Miss Steeles kept their station at the park , and were to quit it only with the rest of the family . CHAPTER 26 Elinor could not find herself in the carriage with Mrs . Jennings , and beginning a journey to London under her protection , and as her guest , without wondering at her own situation , so short had their acquaintance with that lady been , so wholly unsuited were they in age and disposition , and so many had been her objections against such a measure only a few days before ! But these objections had all , with that happy ardour of youth which Marianne and her mother equally shared , been overcome or overlooked ; and Elinor , in spite of every occasional doubt of Willoughby ' s constancy , could not witness the rapture of delightful expectation which filled the whole soul and beamed in the eyes of Marianne , without feeling how blank was her own prospect , how cheerless her own state of mind in the comparison , and how gladly she would engage in the solicitude of Marianne ' s situation to have the same animating object in view , the same possibility of hope . A short , a very short time however must now decide what Willoughby ' s intentions were ; in all probability he was already in town . Marianne ' s eagerness to be gone declared her dependence on finding him there ; and Elinor was resolved not only upon gaining every new light as to his character which her own observation or the intelligence of others could give her , but likewise upon watching his behaviour to her sister with such zealous attention , as to ascertain what he was and what he meant , before many meetings had taken place .
austen#Should the result of her observations be unfavourable , she was determined at all events to open the eyes of her sister ; should it be otherwise , her exertions would be of a different nature -- she must then learn to avoid every selfish comparison , and banish every regret which might lessen her satisfaction in the happiness of Marianne . They were three days on their journey , and Marianne ' s behaviour as they travelled was a happy specimen of what future complaisance and companionableness to Mrs . Jennings might be expected to be . She sat in silence almost all the way , wrapt in her own meditations , and scarcely ever voluntarily speaking , except when any object of picturesque beauty within their view drew from her an exclamation of delight exclusively addressed to her sister . To atone for this conduct therefore , Elinor took immediate possession of the post of civility which she had assigned herself , behaved with the greatest attention to Mrs . Jennings , talked with her , laughed with her , and listened to her whenever she could ; and Mrs . Jennings on her side treated them both with all possible kindness , was solicitous on every occasion for their ease and enjoyment , and only disturbed that she could not make them choose their own dinners at the inn , nor extort a confession of their preferring salmon to cod , or boiled fowls to veal cutlets . They reached town by three o ' clock the third day , glad to be released , after such a journey , from the confinement of a carriage , and ready to enjoy all the luxury of a good fire . The house was handsome , and handsomely fitted up , and the young ladies were immediately put in possession of a very comfortable apartment .
austen#"It had formerly been Charlotte ' s , and over the mantelpiece still hung a landscape in coloured silks of her performance , in proof of her having spent seven years at a great school in town to some effect . As dinner was not to be ready in less than two hours from their arrival , Elinor determined to employ the interval in writing to her mother , and sat down for that purpose . In a few moments Marianne did the same . "" I am writing home , Marianne ,"" said Elinor ; "" had not you better defer your letter for a day or two ?"" "" I am NOT going to write to my mother ,"" replied Marianne , hastily , and as if wishing to avoid any farther inquiry . Elinor said no more ; it immediately struck her that she must then be writing to Willoughby ; and the conclusion which as instantly followed was , that , however mysteriously they might wish to conduct the affair , they must be engaged ."
austen#This conviction , though not entirely satisfactory , gave her pleasure , and she continued her letter with greater alacrity . Marianne ' s was finished in a very few minutes ; in length it could be no more than a note ; it was then folded up , sealed , and directed with eager rapidity . Elinor thought she could distinguish a large W in the direction ; and no sooner was it complete than Marianne , ringing the bell , requested the footman who answered it to get that letter conveyed for her to the two - penny post . This decided the matter at once . Her spirits still continued very high ; but there was a flutter in them which prevented their giving much pleasure to her sister , and this agitation increased as the evening drew on . She could scarcely eat any dinner , and when they afterwards returned to the drawing room , seemed anxiously listening to the sound of every carriage .
austen#"It was a great satisfaction to Elinor that Mrs . Jennings , by being much engaged in her own room , could see little of what was passing . The tea things were brought in , and already had Marianne been disappointed more than once by a rap at a neighbouring door , when a loud one was suddenly heard which could not be mistaken for one at any other house , Elinor felt secure of its announcing Willoughby ' s approach , and Marianne , starting up , moved towards the door . Every thing was silent ; this could not be borne many seconds ; she opened the door , advanced a few steps towards the stairs , and after listening half a minute , returned into the room in all the agitation which a conviction of having heard him would naturally produce ; in the ecstasy of her feelings at that instant she could not help exclaiming , "" Oh , Elinor , it is Willoughby , indeed it is !"" and seemed almost ready to throw herself into his arms , when Colonel Brandon appeared . It was too great a shock to be borne with calmness , and she immediately left the room . Elinor was disappointed too ; but at the same time her regard for Colonel Brandon ensured his welcome with her ; and she felt particularly hurt that a man so partial to her sister should perceive that she experienced nothing but grief and disappointment in seeing him ."
austen#"She instantly saw that it was not unnoticed by him , that he even observed Marianne as she quitted the room , with such astonishment and concern , as hardly left him the recollection of what civility demanded towards herself . "" Is your sister ill ?"" said he . Elinor answered in some distress that she was , and then talked of head - aches , low spirits , and over fatigues ; and of every thing to which she could decently attribute her sister ' s behaviour . He heard her with the most earnest attention , but seeming to recollect himself , said no more on the subject , and began directly to speak of his pleasure at seeing them in London , making the usual inquiries about their journey , and the friends they had left behind . In this calm kind of way , with very little interest on either side , they continued to talk , both of them out of spirits , and the thoughts of both engaged elsewhere ."
austen#"Elinor wished very much to ask whether Willoughby were then in town , but she was afraid of giving him pain by any enquiry after his rival ; and at length , by way of saying something , she asked if he had been in London ever since she had seen him last . "" Yes ,"" he replied , with some embarrassment , "" almost ever since ; I have been once or twice at Delaford for a few days , but it has never been in my power to return to Barton ."" This , and the manner in which it was said , immediately brought back to her remembrance all the circumstances of his quitting that place , with the uneasiness and suspicions they had caused to Mrs . Jennings , and she was fearful that her question had implied much more curiosity on the subject than she had ever felt . Mrs . Jennings soon came in . "" Oh ! Colonel ,"" said she , with her usual noisy cheerfulness , "" I am monstrous glad to see you -- sorry I could not come before -- beg your pardon , but I have been forced to look about me a little , and settle my matters ; for it is a long while since I have been at home , and you know one has always a world of little odd things to do after one has been away for any time ; and then I have had Cartwright to settle with -- Lord , I have been as busy as a bee ever since dinner !"
austen#"But pray , Colonel , how came you to conjure out that I should be in town today ?"" "" I had the pleasure of hearing it at Mr . Palmer ' s , where I have been dining ."" "" Oh , you did ; well , and how do they all do at their house ? How does Charlotte do ? I warrant you she is a fine size by this time ."" "" Mrs . Palmer appeared quite well , and I am commissioned to tell you , that you will certainly see her to - morrow ."""
austen#""" Ay , to be sure , I thought as much . Well , Colonel , I have brought two young ladies with me , you see -- that is , you see but one of them now , but there is another somewhere . Your friend , Miss Marianne , too -- which you will not be sorry to hear . I do not know what you and Mr . Willoughby will do between you about her . Ay , it is a fine thing to be young and handsome . Well !"
austen#I was young once , but I never was very handsome -- worse luck for me . However , I got a very good husband , and I don ' t know what the greatest beauty can do more . Ah ! poor man ! he has been dead these eight years and better . But Colonel , where have you been to since we parted ?
austen#"And how does your business go on ? Come , come , let ' s have no secrets among friends ."" He replied with his accustomary mildness to all her inquiries , but without satisfying her in any . Elinor now began to make the tea , and Marianne was obliged to appear again . After her entrance , Colonel Brandon became more thoughtful and silent than he had been before , and Mrs . Jennings could not prevail on him to stay long . No other visitor appeared that evening , and the ladies were unanimous in agreeing to go early to bed ."
austen#"Marianne rose the next morning with recovered spirits and happy looks . The disappointment of the evening before seemed forgotten in the expectation of what was to happen that day . They had not long finished their breakfast before Mrs . Palmer ' s barouche stopped at the door , and in a few minutes she came laughing into the room : so delighted to see them all , that it was hard to say whether she received most pleasure from meeting her mother or the Miss Dashwoods again . So surprised at their coming to town , though it was what she had rather expected all along ; so angry at their accepting her mother ' s invitation after having declined her own , though at the same time she would never have forgiven them if they had not come ! "" Mr . Palmer will be so happy to see you ,"" said she ; "" What do you think he said when he heard of your coming with Mamma ? I forget what it was now , but it was something so droll !"""
austen#"After an hour or two spent in what her mother called comfortable chat , or in other words , in every variety of inquiry concerning all their acquaintance on Mrs . Jennings ' s side , and in laughter without cause on Mrs . Palmer ' s , it was proposed by the latter that they should all accompany her to some shops where she had business that morning , to which Mrs . Jennings and Elinor readily consented , as having likewise some purchases to make themselves ; and Marianne , though declining it at first was induced to go likewise . Wherever they went , she was evidently always on the watch . In Bond Street especially , where much of their business lay , her eyes were in constant inquiry ; and in whatever shop the party were engaged , her mind was equally abstracted from every thing actually before them , from all that interested and occupied the others . Restless and dissatisfied every where , her sister could never obtain her opinion of any article of purchase , however it might equally concern them both : she received no pleasure from anything ; was only impatient to be at home again , and could with difficulty govern her vexation at the tediousness of Mrs . Palmer , whose eye was caught by every thing pretty , expensive , or new ; who was wild to buy all , could determine on none , and dawdled away her time in rapture and indecision . It was late in the morning before they returned home ; and no sooner had they entered the house than Marianne flew eagerly up stairs , and when Elinor followed , she found her turning from the table with a sorrowful countenance , which declared that no Willoughby had been there . "" Has no letter been left here for me since we went out ?"""
austen#"said she to the footman who then entered with the parcels . She was answered in the negative . "" Are you quite sure of it ?"" she replied . "" Are you certain that no servant , no porter has left any letter or note ?"" The man replied that none had ."
austen#""" How very odd !"" said she , in a low and disappointed voice , as she turned away to the window . "" How odd , indeed !"" repeated Elinor within herself , regarding her sister with uneasiness . "" If she had not known him to be in town she would not have written to him , as she did ; she would have written to Combe Magna ; and if he is in town , how odd that he should neither come nor write ! Oh !"
austen#"my dear mother , you must be wrong in permitting an engagement between a daughter so young , a man so little known , to be carried on in so doubtful , so mysterious a manner ! I long to inquire ; and how will MY interference be borne ."" She determined , after some consideration , that if appearances continued many days longer as unpleasant as they now were , she would represent in the strongest manner to her mother the necessity of some serious enquiry into the affair . Mrs . Palmer and two elderly ladies of Mrs . Jennings ' s intimate acquaintance , whom she had met and invited in the morning , dined with them . The former left them soon after tea to fulfill her evening engagements ; and Elinor was obliged to assist in making a whist table for the others . Marianne was of no use on these occasions , as she would never learn the game ; but though her time was therefore at her own disposal , the evening was by no means more productive of pleasure to her than to Elinor , for it was spent in all the anxiety of expectation and the pain of disappointment ."
austen#"She sometimes endeavoured for a few minutes to read ; but the book was soon thrown aside , and she returned to the more interesting employment of walking backwards and forwards across the room , pausing for a moment whenever she came to the window , in hopes of distinguishing the long - expected rap . CHAPTER 27 "" If this open weather holds much longer ,"" said Mrs . Jennings , when they met at breakfast the following morning , "" Sir John will not like leaving Barton next week ; ' tis a sad thing for sportsmen to lose a day ' s pleasure . Poor souls ! I always pity them when they do ; they seem to take it so much to heart ."" "" That is true ,"" cried Marianne , in a cheerful voice , and walking to the window as she spoke , to examine the day ."
austen#""" I had not thought of that . This weather will keep many sportsmen in the country ."" It was a lucky recollection , all her good spirits were restored by it . "" It is charming weather for THEM indeed ,"" she continued , as she sat down to the breakfast table with a happy countenance . "" How much they must enjoy it ! But "" ( with a little return of anxiety ) "" it cannot be expected to last long ."
austen#"At this time of the year , and after such a series of rain , we shall certainly have very little more of it . Frosts will soon set in , and in all probability with severity . In another day or two perhaps ; this extreme mildness can hardly last longer -- nay , perhaps it may freeze tonight !"" "" At any rate ,"" said Elinor , wishing to prevent Mrs . Jennings from seeing her sister ' s thoughts as clearly as she did , "" I dare say we shall have Sir John and Lady Middleton in town by the end of next week ."" "" Ay , my dear , I ' ll warrant you we do . Mary always has her own way ."""
austen#""" And now ,"" silently conjectured Elinor , "" she will write to Combe by this day ' s post ."" But if she DID , the letter was written and sent away with a privacy which eluded all her watchfulness to ascertain the fact . Whatever the truth of it might be , and far as Elinor was from feeling thorough contentment about it , yet while she saw Marianne in spirits , she could not be very uncomfortable herself . And Marianne was in spirits ; happy in the mildness of the weather , and still happier in her expectation of a frost . The morning was chiefly spent in leaving cards at the houses of Mrs . Jennings ' s acquaintance to inform them of her being in town ; and Marianne was all the time busy in observing the direction of the wind , watching the variations of the sky and imagining an alteration in the air . "" Don ' t you find it colder than it was in the morning , Elinor ?"
austen#"There seems to me a very decided difference . I can hardly keep my hands warm even in my muff . It was not so yesterday , I think . The clouds seem parting too , the sun will be out in a moment , and we shall have a clear afternoon ."" Elinor was alternately diverted and pained ; but Marianne persevered , and saw every night in the brightness of the fire , and every morning in the appearance of the atmosphere , the certain symptoms of approaching frost . The Miss Dashwoods had no greater reason to be dissatisfied with Mrs . Jennings ' s style of living , and set of acquaintance , than with her behaviour to themselves , which was invariably kind ."
austen#Every thing in her household arrangements was conducted on the most liberal plan , and excepting a few old city friends , whom , to Lady Middleton ' s regret , she had never dropped , she visited no one to whom an introduction could at all discompose the feelings of her young companions . Pleased to find herself more comfortably situated in that particular than she had expected , Elinor was very willing to compound for the want of much real enjoyment from any of their evening parties , which , whether at home or abroad , formed only for cards , could have little to amuse her . Colonel Brandon , who had a general invitation to the house , was with them almost every day ; he came to look at Marianne and talk to Elinor , who often derived more satisfaction from conversing with him than from any other daily occurrence , but who saw at the same time with much concern his continued regard for her sister . She feared it was a strengthening regard . It grieved her to see the earnestness with which he often watched Marianne , and his spirits were certainly worse than when at Barton . About a week after their arrival , it became certain that Willoughby was also arrived .
austen#"His card was on the table when they came in from the morning ' s drive . "" Good God !"" cried Marianne , "" he has been here while we were out ."" Elinor , rejoiced to be assured of his being in London , now ventured to say , "" Depend upon it , he will call again tomorrow ."" But Marianne seemed hardly to hear her , and on Mrs . Jenning ' s entrance , escaped with the precious card . This event , while it raised the spirits of Elinor , restored to those of her sister all , and more than all , their former agitation ."
austen#"From this moment her mind was never quiet ; the expectation of seeing him every hour of the day , made her unfit for any thing . She insisted on being left behind , the next morning , when the others went out . Elinor ' s thoughts were full of what might be passing in Berkeley Street during their absence ; but a moment ' s glance at her sister when they returned was enough to inform her , that Willoughby had paid no second visit there . A note was just then brought in , and laid on the table , "" For me !"" cried Marianne , stepping hastily forward ."
austen#""" No , ma ' am , for my mistress ."" But Marianne , not convinced , took it instantly up . "" It is indeed for Mrs . Jennings ; how provoking !"" "" You are expecting a letter , then ?"" said Elinor , unable to be longer silent . "" Yes , a little -- not much ."""
austen#"After a short pause . "" You have no confidence in me , Marianne ."" "" Nay , Elinor , this reproach from YOU -- you who have confidence in no one !"" "" Me !"" returned Elinor in some confusion ; "" indeed , Marianne , I have nothing to tell ."" "" Nor I ,"" answered Marianne with energy , "" our situations then are alike ."
austen#"We have neither of us any thing to tell ; you , because you do not communicate , and I , because I conceal nothing ."" Elinor , distressed by this charge of reserve in herself , which she was not at liberty to do away , knew not how , under such circumstances , to press for greater openness in Marianne . Mrs . Jennings soon appeared , and the note being given her , she read it aloud . It was from Lady Middleton , announcing their arrival in Conduit Street the night before , and requesting the company of her mother and cousins the following evening . Business on Sir John ' s part , and a violent cold on her own , prevented their calling in Berkeley Street . The invitation was accepted ; but when the hour of appointment drew near , necessary as it was in common civility to Mrs . Jennings , that they should both attend her on such a visit , Elinor had some difficulty in persuading her sister to go , for still she had seen nothing of Willoughby ; and therefore was not more indisposed for amusement abroad , than unwilling to run the risk of his calling again in her absence ."
austen#Elinor found , when the evening was over , that disposition is not materially altered by a change of abode , for although scarcely settled in town , Sir John had contrived to collect around him , nearly twenty young people , and to amuse them with a ball . This was an affair , however , of which Lady Middleton did not approve . In the country , an unpremeditated dance was very allowable ; but in London , where the reputation of elegance was more important and less easily attained , it was risking too much for the gratification of a few girls , to have it known that Lady Middleton had given a small dance of eight or nine couple , with two violins , and a mere side - board collation . Mr . and Mrs . Palmer were of the party ; from the former , whom they had not seen before since their arrival in town , as he was careful to avoid the appearance of any attention to his mother - in - law , and therefore never came near her , they received no mark of recognition on their entrance . He looked at them slightly , without seeming to know who they were , and merely nodded to Mrs . Jennings from the other side of the room . Marianne gave one glance round the apartment as she entered : it was enough -- HE was not there -- and she sat down , equally ill - disposed to receive or communicate pleasure .
austen#"After they had been assembled about an hour , Mr . Palmer sauntered towards the Miss Dashwoods to express his surprise on seeing them in town , though Colonel Brandon had been first informed of their arrival at his house , and he had himself said something very droll on hearing that they were to come . "" I thought you were both in Devonshire ,"" said he . "" Did you ?"" replied Elinor . "" When do you go back again ?"" "" I do not know ."""
austen#"And thus ended their discourse . Never had Marianne been so unwilling to dance in her life , as she was that evening , and never so much fatigued by the exercise . She complained of it as they returned to Berkeley Street . "" Aye , aye ,"" said Mrs . Jennings , "" we know the reason of all that very well ; if a certain person who shall be nameless , had been there , you would not have been a bit tired : and to say the truth it was not very pretty of him not to give you the meeting when he was invited ."" "" Invited !"" cried Marianne ."
austen#""" So my daughter Middleton told me , for it seems Sir John met him somewhere in the street this morning ."" Marianne said no more , but looked exceedingly hurt . Impatient in this situation to be doing something that might lead to her sister ' s relief , Elinor resolved to write the next morning to her mother , and hoped by awakening her fears for the health of Marianne , to procure those inquiries which had been so long delayed ; and she was still more eagerly bent on this measure by perceiving after breakfast on the morrow , that Marianne was again writing to Willoughby , for she could not suppose it to be to any other person . About the middle of the day , Mrs . Jennings went out by herself on business , and Elinor began her letter directly , while Marianne , too restless for employment , too anxious for conversation , walked from one window to the other , or sat down by the fire in melancholy meditation . Elinor was very earnest in her application to her mother , relating all that had passed , her suspicions of Willoughby ' s inconstancy , urging her by every plea of duty and affection to demand from Marianne an account of her real situation with respect to him . Her letter was scarcely finished , when a rap foretold a visitor , and Colonel Brandon was announced ."
austen#"Marianne , who had seen him from the window , and who hated company of any kind , left the room before he entered it . He looked more than usually grave , and though expressing satisfaction at finding Miss Dashwood alone , as if he had somewhat in particular to tell her , sat for some time without saying a word . Elinor , persuaded that he had some communication to make in which her sister was concerned , impatiently expected its opening . It was not the first time of her feeling the same kind of conviction ; for , more than once before , beginning with the observation of "" your sister looks unwell to - day ,"" or "" your sister seems out of spirits ,"" he had appeared on the point , either of disclosing , or of inquiring , something particular about her . After a pause of several minutes , their silence was broken , by his asking her in a voice of some agitation , when he was to congratulate her on the acquisition of a brother ? Elinor was not prepared for such a question , and having no answer ready , was obliged to adopt the simple and common expedient , of asking what he meant ?"
austen#"He tried to smile as he replied , "" your sister ' s engagement to Mr . Willoughby is very generally known ."" "" It cannot be generally known ,"" returned Elinor , "" for her own family do not know it ."" He looked surprised and said , "" I beg your pardon , I am afraid my inquiry has been impertinent ; but I had not supposed any secrecy intended , as they openly correspond , and their marriage is universally talked of ."" "" How can that be ? By whom can you have heard it mentioned ?"" "" By many -- by some of whom you know nothing , by others with whom you are most intimate , Mrs . Jennings , Mrs . Palmer , and the Middletons ."
austen#But still I might not have believed it , for where the mind is perhaps rather unwilling to be convinced , it will always find something to support its doubts , if I had not , when the servant let me in today , accidentally seen a letter in his hand , directed to Mr . Willoughby in your sister ' s writing . I came to inquire , but I was convinced before I could ask the question . Is every thing finally settled ? Is it impossible to -? But I have no right , and I could have no chance of succeeding . Excuse me , Miss Dashwood .
austen#"I believe I have been wrong in saying so much , but I hardly know what to do , and on your prudence I have the strongest dependence . Tell me that it is all absolutely resolved on , that any attempt , that in short concealment , if concealment be possible , is all that remains ."" These words , which conveyed to Elinor a direct avowal of his love for her sister , affected her very much . She was not immediately able to say anything , and even when her spirits were recovered , she debated for a short time , on the answer it would be most proper to give . The real state of things between Willoughby and her sister was so little known to herself , that in endeavouring to explain it , she might be as liable to say too much as too little . Yet as she was convinced that Marianne ' s affection for Willoughby , could leave no hope of Colonel Brandon ' s success , whatever the event of that affection might be , and at the same time wished to shield her conduct from censure , she thought it most prudent and kind , after some consideration , to say more than she really knew or believed ."
austen#"She acknowledged , therefore , that though she had never been informed by themselves of the terms on which they stood with each other , of their mutual affection she had no doubt , and of their correspondence she was not astonished to hear . He listened to her with silent attention , and on her ceasing to speak , rose directly from his seat , and after saying in a voice of emotion , "" to your sister I wish all imaginable happiness ; to Willoughby that he may endeavour to deserve her ,""-- took leave , and went away . Elinor derived no comfortable feelings from this conversation , to lessen the uneasiness of her mind on other points ; she was left , on the contrary , with a melancholy impression of Colonel Brandon ' s unhappiness , and was prevented even from wishing it removed , by her anxiety for the very event that must confirm it . CHAPTER 28 Nothing occurred during the next three or four days , to make Elinor regret what she had done , in applying to her mother ; for Willoughby neither came nor wrote . They were engaged about the end of that time to attend Lady Middleton to a party , from which Mrs . Jennings was kept away by the indisposition of her youngest daughter ; and for this party , Marianne , wholly dispirited , careless of her appearance , and seeming equally indifferent whether she went or staid , prepared , without one look of hope or one expression of pleasure ."
austen#She sat by the drawing - room fire after tea , till the moment of Lady Middleton ' s arrival , without once stirring from her seat , or altering her attitude , lost in her own thoughts , and insensible of her sister ' s presence ; and when at last they were told that Lady Middleton waited for them at the door , she started as if she had forgotten that any one was expected . They arrived in due time at the place of destination , and as soon as the string of carriages before them would allow , alighted , ascended the stairs , heard their names announced from one landing - place to another in an audible voice , and entered a room splendidly lit up , quite full of company , and insufferably hot . When they had paid their tribute of politeness by curtsying to the lady of the house , they were permitted to mingle in the crowd , and take their share of the heat and inconvenience , to which their arrival must necessarily add . After some time spent in saying little or doing less , Lady Middleton sat down to Cassino , and as Marianne was not in spirits for moving about , she and Elinor luckily succeeding to chairs , placed themselves at no great distance from the table . They had not remained in this manner long , before Elinor perceived Willoughby , standing within a few yards of them , in earnest conversation with a very fashionable looking young woman . She soon caught his eye , and he immediately bowed , but without attempting to speak to her , or to approach Marianne , though he could not but see her ; and then continued his discourse with the same lady .
austen#"Elinor turned involuntarily to Marianne , to see whether it could be unobserved by her . At that moment she first perceived him , and her whole countenance glowing with sudden delight , she would have moved towards him instantly , had not her sister caught hold of her . "" Good heavens !"" she exclaimed , "" he is there -- he is there -- Oh ! why does he not look at me ? why cannot I speak to him ?"""
austen#""" Pray , pray be composed ,"" cried Elinor , "" and do not betray what you feel to every body present . Perhaps he has not observed you yet ."" This however was more than she could believe herself ; and to be composed at such a moment was not only beyond the reach of Marianne , it was beyond her wish . She sat in an agony of impatience which affected every feature . At last he turned round again , and regarded them both ; she started up , and pronouncing his name in a tone of affection , held out her hand to him . He approached , and addressing himself rather to Elinor than Marianne , as if wishing to avoid her eye , and determined not to observe her attitude , inquired in a hurried manner after Mrs . Dashwood , and asked how long they had been in town ."
austen#"Elinor was robbed of all presence of mind by such an address , and was unable to say a word . But the feelings of her sister were instantly expressed . Her face was crimsoned over , and she exclaimed , in a voice of the greatest emotion , "" Good God ! Willoughby , what is the meaning of this ? Have you not received my letters ? Will you not shake hands with me ?"""
austen#"He could not then avoid it , but her touch seemed painful to him , and he held her hand only for a moment . During all this time he was evidently struggling for composure . Elinor watched his countenance and saw its expression becoming more tranquil . After a moment ' s pause , he spoke with calmness . "" I did myself the honour of calling in Berkeley Street last Tuesday , and very much regretted that I was not fortunate enough to find yourselves and Mrs . Jennings at home . My card was not lost , I hope ."""
austen#""" But have you not received my notes ?"" cried Marianne in the wildest anxiety . "" Here is some mistake I am sure -- some dreadful mistake . What can be the meaning of it ? Tell me , Willoughby ; for heaven ' s sake tell me , what is the matter ?"" He made no reply ; his complexion changed and all his embarrassment returned ; but as if , on catching the eye of the young lady with whom he had been previously talking , he felt the necessity of instant exertion , he recovered himself again , and after saying , "" Yes , I had the pleasure of receiving the information of your arrival in town , which you were so good as to send me ,"" turned hastily away with a slight bow and joined his friend ."
austen#"Marianne , now looking dreadfully white , and unable to stand , sunk into her chair , and Elinor , expecting every moment to see her faint , tried to screen her from the observation of others , while reviving her with lavender water . "" Go to him , Elinor ,"" she cried , as soon as she could speak , "" and force him to come to me . Tell him I must see him again -- must speak to him instantly .-- I cannot rest -- I shall not have a moment ' s peace till this is explained -- some dreadful misapprehension or other .-- Oh go to him this moment ."" "" How can that be done ? No , my dearest Marianne , you must wait . This is not the place for explanations ."
austen#"Wait only till tomorrow ."" With difficulty however could she prevent her from following him herself ; and to persuade her to check her agitation , to wait , at least , with the appearance of composure , till she might speak to him with more privacy and more effect , was impossible ; for Marianne continued incessantly to give way in a low voice to the misery of her feelings , by exclamations of wretchedness . In a short time Elinor saw Willoughby quit the room by the door towards the staircase , and telling Marianne that he was gone , urged the impossibility of speaking to him again that evening , as a fresh argument for her to be calm . She instantly begged her sister would entreat Lady Middleton to take them home , as she was too miserable to stay a minute longer . Lady Middleton , though in the middle of a rubber , on being informed that Marianne was unwell , was too polite to object for a moment to her wish of going away , and making over her cards to a friend , they departed as soon the carriage could be found . Scarcely a word was spoken during their return to Berkeley Street ."
austen#Marianne was in a silent agony , too much oppressed even for tears ; but as Mrs . Jennings was luckily not come home , they could go directly to their own room , where hartshorn restored her a little to herself . She was soon undressed and in bed , and as she seemed desirous of being alone , her sister then left her , and while she waited the return of Mrs . Jennings , had leisure enough for thinking over the past . That some kind of engagement had subsisted between Willoughby and Marianne she could not doubt , and that Willoughby was weary of it , seemed equally clear ; for however Marianne might still feed her own wishes , SHE could not attribute such behaviour to mistake or misapprehension of any kind . Nothing but a thorough change of sentiment could account for it . Her indignation would have been still stronger than it was , had she not witnessed that embarrassment which seemed to speak a consciousness of his own misconduct , and prevented her from believing him so unprincipled as to have been sporting with the affections of her sister from the first , without any design that would bear investigation . Absence might have weakened his regard , and convenience might have determined him to overcome it , but that such a regard had formerly existed she could not bring herself to doubt .
austen#As for Marianne , on the pangs which so unhappy a meeting must already have given her , and on those still more severe which might await her in its probable consequence , she could not reflect without the deepest concern . Her own situation gained in the comparison ; for while she could ESTEEM Edward as much as ever , however they might be divided in future , her mind might be always supported . But every circumstance that could embitter such an evil seemed uniting to heighten the misery of Marianne in a final separation from Willoughby -- in an immediate and irreconcilable rupture with him . CHAPTER 29 Before the house - maid had lit their fire the next day , or the sun gained any power over a cold , gloomy morning in January , Marianne , only half dressed , was kneeling against one of the window - seats for the sake of all the little light she could command from it , and writing as fast as a continual flow of tears would permit her . In this situation , Elinor , roused from sleep by her agitation and sobs , first perceived her ; and after observing her for a few moments with silent anxiety , said , in a tone of the most considerate gentleness ,
austen#""" Marianne , may I ask -?"" "" No , Elinor ,"" she replied , "" ask nothing ; you will soon know all ."" The sort of desperate calmness with which this was said , lasted no longer than while she spoke , and was immediately followed by a return of the same excessive affliction . It was some minutes before she could go on with her letter , and the frequent bursts of grief which still obliged her , at intervals , to withhold her pen , were proofs enough of her feeling how more than probable it was that she was writing for the last time to Willoughby . Elinor paid her every quiet and unobtrusive attention in her power ; and she would have tried to sooth and tranquilize her still more , had not Marianne entreated her , with all the eagerness of the most nervous irritability , not to speak to her for the world . In such circumstances , it was better for both that they should not be long together ; and the restless state of Marianne ' s mind not only prevented her from remaining in the room a moment after she was dressed , but requiring at once solitude and continual change of place , made her wander about the house till breakfast time , avoiding the sight of every body ."
austen#"At breakfast she neither ate , nor attempted to eat any thing ; and Elinor ' s attention was then all employed , not in urging her , not in pitying her , nor in appearing to regard her , but in endeavouring to engage Mrs . Jenning ' s notice entirely to herself . As this was a favourite meal with Mrs . Jennings , it lasted a considerable time , and they were just setting themselves , after it , round the common working table , when a letter was delivered to Marianne , which she eagerly caught from the servant , and , turning of a death - like paleness , instantly ran out of the room . Elinor , who saw as plainly by this , as if she had seen the direction , that it must come from Willoughby , felt immediately such a sickness at heart as made her hardly able to hold up her head , and sat in such a general tremour as made her fear it impossible to escape Mrs . Jenning ' s notice . That good lady , however , saw only that Marianne had received a letter from Willoughby , which appeared to her a very good joke , and which she treated accordingly , by hoping , with a laugh , that she would find it to her liking . Of Elinor ' s distress , she was too busily employed in measuring lengths of worsted for her rug , to see any thing at all ; and calmly continuing her talk , as soon as Marianne disappeared , she said , "" Upon my word , I never saw a young woman so desperately in love in my life !"
austen#"MY girls were nothing to her , and yet they used to be foolish enough ; but as for Miss Marianne , she is quite an altered creature . I hope , from the bottom of my heart , he won ' t keep her waiting much longer , for it is quite grievous to see her look so ill and forlorn . Pray , when are they to be married ?"" Elinor , though never less disposed to speak than at that moment , obliged herself to answer such an attack as this , and , therefore , trying to smile , replied , "" And have you really , Ma ' am , talked yourself into a persuasion of my sister ' s being engaged to Mr . Willoughby ? I thought it had been only a joke , but so serious a question seems to imply more ; and I must beg , therefore , that you will not deceive yourself any longer . I do assure you that nothing would surprise me more than to hear of their being going to be married ."""
austen#""" For shame , for shame , Miss Dashwood ! how can you talk so ? Don ' t we all know that it must be a match , that they were over head and ears in love with each other from the first moment they met ? Did not I see them together in Devonshire every day , and all day long ; and did not I know that your sister came to town with me on purpose to buy wedding clothes ? Come , come , this won ' t do . Because you are so sly about it yourself , you think nobody else has any senses ; but it is no such thing , I can tell you , for it has been known all over town this ever so long ."
austen#"I tell every body of it and so does Charlotte ."" "" Indeed , Ma ' am ,"" said Elinor , very seriously , "" you are mistaken . Indeed , you are doing a very unkind thing in spreading the report , and you will find that you have though you will not believe me now ."" Mrs . Jennings laughed again , but Elinor had not spirits to say more , and eager at all events to know what Willoughby had written , hurried away to their room , where , on opening the door , she saw Marianne stretched on the bed , almost choked by grief , one letter in her hand , and two or three others laying by her . Elinor drew near , but without saying a word ; and seating herself on the bed , took her hand , kissed her affectionately several times , and then gave way to a burst of tears , which at first was scarcely less violent than Marianne ' s . The latter , though unable to speak , seemed to feel all the tenderness of this behaviour , and after some time thus spent in joint affliction , she put all the letters into Elinor ' s hands ; and then covering her face with her handkerchief , almost screamed with agony ."
austen#"Elinor , who knew that such grief , shocking as it was to witness it , must have its course , watched by her till this excess of suffering had somewhat spent itself , and then turning eagerly to Willoughby ' s letter , read as follows : "" Bond Street , January . "" MY DEAR MADAM , "" I have just had the honour of receiving your letter , for which I beg to return my sincere acknowledgments . I am much concerned to find there was anything in my behaviour last night that did not meet your approbation ; and though I am quite at a loss to discover in what point I could be so unfortunate as to offend you , I entreat your forgiveness of what I can assure you to have been perfectly unintentional . I shall never reflect on my former acquaintance with your family in Devonshire without the most grateful pleasure , and flatter myself it will not be broken by any mistake or misapprehension of my actions ."
austen#"My esteem for your whole family is very sincere ; but if I have been so unfortunate as to give rise to a belief of more than I felt , or meant to express , I shall reproach myself for not having been more guarded in my professions of that esteem . That I should ever have meant more you will allow to be impossible , when you understand that my affections have been long engaged elsewhere , and it will not be many weeks , I believe , before this engagement is fulfilled . It is with great regret that I obey your commands in returning the letters with which I have been honoured from you , and the lock of hair , which you so obligingly bestowed on me . "" I am , dear Madam , "" Your most obedient "" humble servant , "" JOHN WILLOUGHBY ."" With what indignation such a letter as this must be read by Miss Dashwood , may be imagined . Though aware , before she began it , that it must bring a confession of his inconstancy , and confirm their separation for ever , she was not aware that such language could be suffered to announce it ; nor could she have supposed Willoughby capable of departing so far from the appearance of every honourable and delicate feeling -- so far from the common decorum of a gentleman , as to send a letter so impudently cruel : a letter which , instead of bringing with his desire of a release any professions of regret , acknowledged no breach of faith , denied all peculiar affection whatever -- a letter of which every line was an insult , and which proclaimed its writer to be deep in hardened villainy ."
austen#"She paused over it for some time with indignant astonishment ; then read it again and again ; but every perusal only served to increase her abhorrence of the man , and so bitter were her feelings against him , that she dared not trust herself to speak , lest she might wound Marianne still deeper by treating their disengagement , not as a loss to her of any possible good but as an escape from the worst and most irremediable of all evils , a connection , for life , with an unprincipled man , as a deliverance the most real , a blessing the most important . In her earnest meditations on the contents of the letter , on the depravity of that mind which could dictate it , and probably , on the very different mind of a very different person , who had no other connection whatever with the affair than what her heart gave him with every thing that passed , Elinor forgot the immediate distress of her sister , forgot that she had three letters on her lap yet unread , and so entirely forgot how long she had been in the room , that when on hearing a carriage drive up to the door , she went to the window to see who could be coming so unreasonably early , she was all astonishment to perceive Mrs . Jennings ' s chariot , which she knew had not been ordered till one . Determined not to quit Marianne , though hopeless of contributing , at present , to her ease , she hurried away to excuse herself from attending Mrs . Jennings , on account of her sister being indisposed . Mrs . Jennings , with a thoroughly good - humoured concern for its cause , admitted the excuse most readily , and Elinor , after seeing her safe off , returned to Marianne , whom she found attempting to rise from the bed , and whom she reached just in time to prevent her from falling on the floor , faint and giddy from a long want of proper rest and food ; for it was many days since she had any appetite , and many nights since she had really slept ; and now , when her mind was no longer supported by the fever of suspense , the consequence of all this was felt in an aching head , a weakened stomach , and a general nervous faintness . A glass of wine , which Elinor procured for her directly , made her more comfortable , and she was at last able to express some sense of her kindness , by saying , "" Poor Elinor !"
austen#"how unhappy I make you !"" "" I only wish ,"" replied her sister , "" there were any thing I COULD do , which might be of comfort to you ."" This , as every thing else would have been , was too much for Marianne , who could only exclaim , in the anguish of her heart , "" Oh ! Elinor , I am miserable , indeed ,"" before her voice was entirely lost in sobs . Elinor could no longer witness this torrent of unresisted grief in silence . "" Exert yourself , dear Marianne ,"" she cried , "" if you would not kill yourself and all who love you ."
austen#"Think of your mother ; think of her misery while YOU suffer : for her sake you must exert yourself ."" "" I cannot , I cannot ,"" cried Marianne ; "" leave me , leave me , if I distress you ; leave me , hate me , forget me ! but do not torture me so . Oh ! how easy for those , who have no sorrow of their own to talk of exertion ! Happy , happy Elinor , YOU cannot have an idea of what I suffer ."""
austen#""" Do you call ME happy , Marianne ? Ah ! if you knew !-- And can you believe me to be so , while I see you so wretched !"" "" Forgive me , forgive me ,"" throwing her arms round her sister ' s neck ; "" I know you feel for me ; I know what a heart you have ; but yet you are -- you must be happy ; Edward loves you -- what , oh what , can do away such happiness as that ?"" "" Many , many circumstances ,"" said Elinor , solemnly . "" No , no , no ,"" cried Marianne wildly , "" he loves you , and only you ."
austen#"You CAN have no grief ."" "" I can have no pleasure while I see you in this state ."" "" And you will never see me otherwise . Mine is a misery which nothing can do away ."" "" You must not talk so , Marianne . Have you no comforts ?"
austen#"no friends ? Is your loss such as leaves no opening for consolation ? Much as you suffer now , think of what you would have suffered if the discovery of his character had been delayed to a later period -- if your engagement had been carried on for months and months , as it might have been , before he chose to put an end to it . Every additional day of unhappy confidence , on your side , would have made the blow more dreadful ."" "" Engagement !"" cried Marianne , "" there has been no engagement ."""
austen#""" No engagement !"" "" No , he is not so unworthy as you believe him . He has broken no faith with me ."" "" But he told you that he loved you ."" "" Yes -- no -- never absolutely . It was every day implied , but never professedly declared ."
austen#"Sometimes I thought it had been -- but it never was ."" "" Yet you wrote to him ?"" -- "" Yes -- could that be wrong after all that had passed ?-- But I cannot talk ."" Elinor said no more , and turning again to the three letters which now raised a much stronger curiosity than before , directly ran over the contents of all . The first , which was what her sister had sent him on their arrival in town , was to this effect ."
austen#"Berkeley Street , January . "" How surprised you will be , Willoughby , on receiving this ; and I think you will feel something more than surprise , when you know that I am in town . An opportunity of coming hither , though with Mrs . Jennings , was a temptation we could not resist . I wish you may receive this in time to come here to - night , but I will not depend on it . At any rate I shall expect you to - morrow . For the present , adieu ."
austen#""" M . D ."" Her second note , which had been written on the morning after the dance at the Middletons ', was in these words :-- "" I cannot express my disappointment in having missed you the day before yesterday , nor my astonishment at not having received any answer to a note which I sent you above a week ago . I have been expecting to hear from you , and still more to see you , every hour of the day . Pray call again as soon as possible , and explain the reason of my having expected this in vain . You had better come earlier another time , because we are generally out by one ."
austen#"We were last night at Lady Middleton ' s , where there was a dance . I have been told that you were asked to be of the party . But could it be so ? You must be very much altered indeed since we parted , if that could be the case , and you not there . But I will not suppose this possible , and I hope very soon to receive your personal assurance of its being otherwise . "" M . D ."""
austen#"The contents of her last note to him were these :-- "" What am I to imagine , Willoughby , by your behaviour last night ? Again I demand an explanation of it . I was prepared to meet you with the pleasure which our separation naturally produced , with the familiarity which our intimacy at Barton appeared to me to justify . I was repulsed indeed ! I have passed a wretched night in endeavouring to excuse a conduct which can scarcely be called less than insulting ; but though I have not yet been able to form any reasonable apology for your behaviour , I am perfectly ready to hear your justification of it ."
austen#"You have perhaps been misinformed , or purposely deceived , in something concerning me , which may have lowered me in your opinion . Tell me what it is , explain the grounds on which you acted , and I shall be satisfied , in being able to satisfy you . It would grieve me indeed to be obliged to think ill of you ; but if I am to do it , if I am to learn that you are not what we have hitherto believed you , that your regard for us all was insincere , that your behaviour to me was intended only to deceive , let it be told as soon as possible . My feelings are at present in a state of dreadful indecision ; I wish to acquit you , but certainty on either side will be ease to what I now suffer . If your sentiments are no longer what they were , you will return my notes , and the lock of my hair which is in your possession . "" M . D ."""
austen#"That such letters , so full of affection and confidence , could have been so answered , Elinor , for Willoughby ' s sake , would have been unwilling to believe . But her condemnation of him did not blind her to the impropriety of their having been written at all ; and she was silently grieving over the imprudence which had hazarded such unsolicited proofs of tenderness , not warranted by anything preceding , and most severely condemned by the event , when Marianne , perceiving that she had finished the letters , observed to her that they contained nothing but what any one would have written in the same situation . "" I felt myself ,"" she added , "" to be as solemnly engaged to him , as if the strictest legal covenant had bound us to each other ."" "" I can believe it ,"" said Elinor ; "" but unfortunately he did not feel the same ."" "" He DID feel the same , Elinor -- for weeks and weeks he felt it . I know he did ."
austen#"Whatever may have changed him now , ( and nothing but the blackest art employed against me can have done it ), I was once as dear to him as my own soul could wish . This lock of hair , which now he can so readily give up , was begged of me with the most earnest supplication . Had you seen his look , his manner , had you heard his voice at that moment ! Have you forgot the last evening of our being together at Barton ? The morning that we parted too ! When he told me that it might be many weeks before we met again -- his distress -- can I ever forget his distress ?"""
austen#"For a moment or two she could say no more ; but when this emotion had passed away , she added , in a firmer tone , "" Elinor , I have been cruelly used ; but not by Willoughby ."" "" Dearest Marianne , who but himself ? By whom can he have been instigated ?"" "" By all the world , rather than by his own heart . I could rather believe every creature of my acquaintance leagued together to ruin me in his opinion , than believe his nature capable of such cruelty ."
austen#"This woman of whom he writes -- whoever she be -- or any one , in short , but your own dear self , mama , and Edward , may have been so barbarous to bely me . Beyond you three , is there a creature in the world whom I would not rather suspect of evil than Willoughby , whose heart I know so well ?"" Elinor would not contend , and only replied , "" Whoever may have been so detestably your enemy , let them be cheated of their malignant triumph , my dear sister , by seeing how nobly the consciousness of your own innocence and good intentions supports your spirits . It is a reasonable and laudable pride which resists such malevolence ."" "" No , no ,"" cried Marianne , "" misery such as mine has no pride . I care not who knows that I am wretched ."
austen#"The triumph of seeing me so may be open to all the world . Elinor , Elinor , they who suffer little may be proud and independent as they like -- may resist insult , or return mortification -- but I cannot . I must feel -- I must be wretched -- and they are welcome to enjoy the consciousness of it that can ."" "" But for my mother ' s sake and mine --"" "" I would do more than for my own . But to appear happy when I am so miserable -- Oh !"
austen#"who can require it ?"" Again they were both silent . Elinor was employed in walking thoughtfully from the fire to the window , from the window to the fire , without knowing that she received warmth from one , or discerning objects through the other ; and Marianne , seated at the foot of the bed , with her head leaning against one of its posts , again took up Willoughby ' s letter , and , after shuddering over every sentence , exclaimed -- "" It is too much ! Oh , Willoughby , Willoughby , could this be yours ! Cruel , cruel -- nothing can acquit you ."
austen#"Elinor , nothing can . Whatever he might have heard against me -- ought he not to have suspended his belief ? ought he not to have told me of it , to have given me the power of clearing myself ? ' The lock of hair , ( repeating it from the letter ,) which you so obligingly bestowed on me '-- That is unpardonable . Willoughby , where was your heart when you wrote those words ? Oh , barbarously insolent !-- Elinor , can he be justified ?"""
austen#""" No , Marianne , in no possible way ."" "" And yet this woman -- who knows what her art may have been ?-- how long it may have been premeditated , and how deeply contrived by her !-- Who is she ?-- Who can she be ?-- Whom did I ever hear him talk of as young and attractive among his female acquaintance ?-- Oh ! no one , no one -- he talked to me only of myself ."" Another pause ensued ; Marianne was greatly agitated , and it ended thus . "" Elinor , I must go home . I must go and comfort mama ."
austen#"Can not we be gone to - morrow ?"" "" To - morrow , Marianne !"" "" Yes , why should I stay here ? I came only for Willoughby ' s sake -- and now who cares for me ? Who regards me ?"" "" It would be impossible to go to - morrow ."
austen#"We owe Mrs . Jennings much more than civility ; and civility of the commonest kind must prevent such a hasty removal as that ."" "" Well then , another day or two , perhaps ; but I cannot stay here long , I cannot stay to endure the questions and remarks of all these people . The Middletons and Palmers -- how am I to bear their pity ? The pity of such a woman as Lady Middleton ! Oh , what would HE say to that !"" Elinor advised her to lie down again , and for a moment she did so ; but no attitude could give her ease ; and in restless pain of mind and body she moved from one posture to another , till growing more and more hysterical , her sister could with difficulty keep her on the bed at all , and for some time was fearful of being constrained to call for assistance ."
austen#"Some lavender drops , however , which she was at length persuaded to take , were of use ; and from that time till Mrs . Jennings returned , she continued on the bed quiet and motionless . CHAPTER 30 Mrs . Jennings came immediately to their room on her return , and without waiting to have her request of admittance answered , opened the door and walked in with a look of real concern . "" How do you do my dear ?"" -- said she in a voice of great compassion to Marianne , who turned away her face without attempting to answer . "" How is she , Miss Dashwood ?-- Poor thing !"
austen#she looks very bad .-- No wonder . Ay , it is but too true . He is to be married very soon -- a good - for - nothing fellow ! I have no patience with him . Mrs . Taylor told me of it half an hour ago , and she was told it by a particular friend of Miss Grey herself , else I am sure I should not have believed it ; and I was almost ready to sink as it was . Well , said I , all I can say is , that if this be true , he has used a young lady of my acquaintance abominably ill , and I wish with all my soul his wife may plague his heart out .
austen#"And so I shall always say , my dear , you may depend on it . I have no notion of men ' s going on in this way ; and if ever I meet him again , I will give him such a dressing as he has not had this many a day . But there is one comfort , my dear Miss Marianne ; he is not the only young man in the world worth having ; and with your pretty face you will never want admirers . Well , poor thing ! I won ' t disturb her any longer , for she had better have her cry out at once and have done with . The Parrys and Sandersons luckily are coming tonight you know , and that will amuse her ."""
austen#"She then went away , walking on tiptoe out of the room , as if she supposed her young friend ' s affliction could be increased by noise . Marianne , to the surprise of her sister , determined on dining with them . Elinor even advised her against it . But "" no , she would go down ; she could bear it very well , and the bustle about her would be less ."" Elinor , pleased to have her governed for a moment by such a motive , though believing it hardly possible that she could sit out the dinner , said no more ; and adjusting her dress for her as well as she could , while Marianne still remained on the bed , was ready to assist her into the dining room as soon as they were summoned to it . When there , though looking most wretchedly , she ate more and was calmer than her sister had expected ."
austen#Had she tried to speak , or had she been conscious of half Mrs . Jennings ' s well - meant but ill - judged attentions to her , this calmness could not have been maintained ; but not a syllable escaped her lips ; and the abstraction of her thoughts preserved her in ignorance of every thing that was passing before her . Elinor , who did justice to Mrs . Jennings ' s kindness , though its effusions were often distressing , and sometimes almost ridiculous , made her those acknowledgments , and returned her those civilities , which her sister could not make or return for herself . Their good friend saw that Marianne was unhappy , and felt that every thing was due to her which might make her at all less so . She treated her therefore , with all the indulgent fondness of a parent towards a favourite child on the last day of its holidays . Marianne was to have the best place by the fire , was to be tempted to eat by every delicacy in the house , and to be amused by the relation of all the news of the day . Had not Elinor , in the sad countenance of her sister , seen a check to all mirth , she could have been entertained by Mrs . Jennings ' s endeavours to cure a disappointment in love , by a variety of sweetmeats and olives , and a good fire .
austen#"As soon , however , as the consciousness of all this was forced by continual repetition on Marianne , she could stay no longer . With a hasty exclamation of Misery , and a sign to her sister not to follow her , she directly got up and hurried out of the room . "" Poor soul !"" cried Mrs . Jennings , as soon as she was gone , "" how it grieves me to see her ! And I declare if she is not gone away without finishing her wine ! And the dried cherries too !"
austen#"Lord ! nothing seems to do her any good . I am sure if I knew of any thing she would like , I would send all over the town for it . Well , it is the oddest thing to me , that a man should use such a pretty girl so ill ! But when there is plenty of money on one side , and next to none on the other , Lord bless you ! they care no more about such things !--"""
austen#""" The lady then -- Miss Grey I think you called her -- is very rich ?"" "" Fifty thousand pounds , my dear . Did you ever see her ? a smart , stylish girl they say , but not handsome . I remember her aunt very well , Biddy Henshawe ; she married a very wealthy man . But the family are all rich together ."
austen#Fifty thousand pounds ! and by all accounts , it won ' t come before it ' s wanted ; for they say he is all to pieces . No wonder ! dashing about with his curricle and hunters ! Well , it don ' t signify talking ; but when a young man , be who he will , comes and makes love to a pretty girl , and promises marriage , he has no business to fly off from his word only because he grows poor , and a richer girl is ready to have him . Why don ' t he , in such a case , sell his horses , let his house , turn off his servants , and make a thorough reform at once ?
austen#"I warrant you , Miss Marianne would have been ready to wait till matters came round . But that won ' t do now - a - days ; nothing in the way of pleasure can ever be given up by the young men of this age ."" "" Do you know what kind of a girl Miss Grey is ? Is she said to be amiable ?"" "" I never heard any harm of her ; indeed I hardly ever heard her mentioned ; except that Mrs . Taylor did say this morning , that one day Miss Walker hinted to her , that she believed Mr . and Mrs . Ellison would not be sorry to have Miss Grey married , for she and Mrs . Ellison could never agree ."" --"
austen#""" And who are the Ellisons ?"" "" Her guardians , my dear . But now she is of age and may choose for herself ; and a pretty choice she has made !-- What now ,"" after pausing a moment --"" your poor sister is gone to her own room , I suppose , to moan by herself . Is there nothing one can get to comfort her ? Poor dear , it seems quite cruel to let her be alone . Well , by - and - by we shall have a few friends , and that will amuse her a little ."
austen#"What shall we play at ? She hates whist I know ; but is there no round game she cares for ?"" "" Dear ma ' am , this kindness is quite unnecessary . Marianne , I dare say , will not leave her room again this evening . I shall persuade her if I can to go early to bed , for I am sure she wants rest ."" "" Aye , I believe that will be best for her ."
austen#Let her name her own supper , and go to bed . Lord ! no wonder she has been looking so bad and so cast down this last week or two , for this matter I suppose has been hanging over her head as long as that . And so the letter that came today finished it ! Poor soul ! I am sure if I had had a notion of it , I would not have joked her about it for all my money .
austen#"But then you know , how should I guess such a thing ? I made sure of its being nothing but a common love letter , and you know young people like to be laughed at about them . Lord ! how concerned Sir John and my daughters will be when they hear it ! If I had my senses about me I might have called in Conduit Street in my way home , and told them of it . But I shall see them tomorrow ."""
austen#""" It would be unnecessary I am sure , for you to caution Mrs . Palmer and Sir John against ever naming Mr . Willoughby , or making the slightest allusion to what has passed , before my sister . Their own good - nature must point out to them the real cruelty of appearing to know any thing about it when she is present ; and the less that may ever be said to myself on the subject , the more my feelings will be spared , as you my dear madam will easily believe ."" "" Oh ! Lord ! yes , that I do indeed . It must be terrible for you to hear it talked of ; and as for your sister , I am sure I would not mention a word about it to her for the world ."
austen#"You saw I did not all dinner time . No more would Sir John , nor my daughters , for they are all very thoughtful and considerate ; especially if I give them a hint , as I certainly will . For my part , I think the less that is said about such things , the better , the sooner ' tis blown over and forgot . And what does talking ever do you know ?"" "" In this affair it can only do harm ; more so perhaps than in many cases of a similar kind , for it has been attended by circumstances which , for the sake of every one concerned in it , make it unfit to become the public conversation . I must do THIS justice to Mr . Willoughby -- he has broken no positive engagement with my sister ."""
austen#""" Law , my dear ! Don ' t pretend to defend him . No positive engagement indeed ! after taking her all over Allenham House , and fixing on the very rooms they were to live in hereafter !"" Elinor , for her sister ' s sake , could not press the subject farther , and she hoped it was not required of her for Willoughby ' s ; since , though Marianne might lose much , he could gain very little by the enforcement of the real truth . After a short silence on both sides , Mrs . Jennings , with all her natural hilarity , burst forth again ."
austen#""" Well , my dear , ' tis a true saying about an ill - wind , for it will be all the better for Colonel Brandon . He will have her at last ; aye , that he will . Mind me , now , if they an ' t married by Mid - summer . Lord ! how he ' ll chuckle over this news ! I hope he will come tonight ."
austen#It will be all to one a better match for your sister . Two thousand a year without debt or drawback -- except the little love - child , indeed ; aye , I had forgot her ; but she may be ' prenticed out at a small cost , and then what does it signify ? Delaford is a nice place , I can tell you ; exactly what I call a nice old fashioned place , full of comforts and conveniences ; quite shut in with great garden walls that are covered with the best fruit - trees in the country ; and such a mulberry tree in one corner ! Lord ! how Charlotte and I did stuff the only time we were there ! Then , there is a dove - cote , some delightful stew - ponds , and a very pretty canal ; and every thing , in short , that one could wish for ; and , moreover , it is close to the church , and only a quarter of a mile from the turnpike - road , so ' tis never dull , for if you only go and sit up in an old yew arbour behind the house , you may see all the carriages that pass along .
austen#Oh ! ' tis a nice place ! A butcher hard by in the village , and the parsonage - house within a stone ' s throw . To my fancy , a thousand times prettier than Barton Park , where they are forced to send three miles for their meat , and have not a neighbour nearer than your mother . Well , I shall spirit up the Colonel as soon as I can . One shoulder of mutton , you know , drives another down .
austen#"If we CAN but put Willoughby out of her head !"" "" Ay , if we can do THAT , Ma ' am ,"" said Elinor , "" we shall do very well with or without Colonel Brandon ."" And then rising , she went away to join Marianne , whom she found , as she expected , in her own room , leaning , in silent misery , over the small remains of a fire , which , till Elinor ' s entrance , had been her only light . "" You had better leave me ,"" was all the notice that her sister received from her . "" I will leave you ,"" said Elinor , "" if you will go to bed ."" But this , from the momentary perverseness of impatient suffering , she at first refused to do ."
austen#"Her sister ' s earnest , though gentle persuasion , however , soon softened her to compliance , and Elinor saw her lay her aching head on the pillow , and as she hoped , in a way to get some quiet rest before she left her . In the drawing - room , whither she then repaired , she was soon joined by Mrs . Jennings , with a wine - glass , full of something , in her hand . "" My dear ,"" said she , entering , "" I have just recollected that I have some of the finest old Constantia wine in the house that ever was tasted , so I have brought a glass of it for your sister . My poor husband ! how fond he was of it ! Whenever he had a touch of his old colicky gout , he said it did him more good than any thing else in the world ."
austen#"Do take it to your sister ."" "" Dear Ma ' am ,"" replied Elinor , smiling at the difference of the complaints for which it was recommended , "" how good you are ! But I have just left Marianne in bed , and , I hope , almost asleep ; and as I think nothing will be of so much service to her as rest , if you will give me leave , I will drink the wine myself ."" Mrs . Jennings , though regretting that she had not been five minutes earlier , was satisfied with the compromise ; and Elinor , as she swallowed the chief of it , reflected , that though its effects on a colicky gout were , at present , of little importance to her , its healing powers , on a disappointed heart might be as reasonably tried on herself as on her sister . Colonel Brandon came in while the party were at tea , and by his manner of looking round the room for Marianne , Elinor immediately fancied that he neither expected nor wished to see her there , and , in short , that he was already aware of what occasioned her absence . Mrs . Jennings was not struck by the same thought ; for soon after his entrance , she walked across the room to the tea - table where Elinor presided , and whispered -- "" The Colonel looks as grave as ever you see ."
austen#"He knows nothing of it ; do tell him , my dear ."" He shortly afterwards drew a chair close to her ' s , and , with a look which perfectly assured her of his good information , inquired after her sister . "" Marianne is not well ,"" said she . "" She has been indisposed all day , and we have persuaded her to go to bed ."" "" Perhaps , then ,"" he hesitatingly replied , "" what I heard this morning may be -- there may be more truth in it than I could believe possible at first ."" "" What did you hear ?"""
austen#""" That a gentleman , whom I had reason to think -- in short , that a man , whom I KNEW to be engaged -- but how shall I tell you ? If you know it already , as surely you must , I may be spared ."" "" You mean ,"" answered Elinor , with forced calmness , "" Mr . Willoughby ' s marriage with Miss Grey . Yes , we DO know it all . This seems to have been a day of general elucidation , for this very morning first unfolded it to us . Mr . Willoughby is unfathomable !"
austen#"Where did you hear it ?"" "" In a stationer ' s shop in Pall Mall , where I had business . Two ladies were waiting for their carriage , and one of them was giving the other an account of the intended match , in a voice so little attempting concealment , that it was impossible for me not to hear all . The name of Willoughby , John Willoughby , frequently repeated , first caught my attention ; and what followed was a positive assertion that every thing was now finally settled respecting his marriage with Miss Grey -- it was no longer to be a secret -- it would take place even within a few weeks , with many particulars of preparations and other matters . One thing , especially , I remember , because it served to identify the man still more :-- as soon as the ceremony was over , they were to go to Combe Magna , his seat in Somersetshire . My astonishment !-- but it would be impossible to describe what I felt ."
austen#"The communicative lady I learnt , on inquiry , for I stayed in the shop till they were gone , was a Mrs . Ellison , and that , as I have been since informed , is the name of Miss Grey ' s guardian ."" "" It is . But have you likewise heard that Miss Grey has fifty thousand pounds ? In that , if in any thing , we may find an explanation ."" "" It may be so ; but Willoughby is capable -- at least I think ""-- he stopped a moment ; then added in a voice which seemed to distrust itself , "" And your sister -- how did she --"" "" Her sufferings have been very severe ."
austen#"I have only to hope that they may be proportionately short . It has been , it is a most cruel affliction . Till yesterday , I believe , she never doubted his regard ; and even now , perhaps -- but I am almost convinced that he never was really attached to her . He has been very deceitful ! and , in some points , there seems a hardness of heart about him ."" "" Ah !"""
austen#"said Colonel Brandon , "" there is , indeed ! But your sister does not -- I think you said so -- she does not consider quite as you do ?"" "" You know her disposition , and may believe how eagerly she would still justify him if she could ."" He made no answer ; and soon afterwards , by the removal of the tea - things , and the arrangement of the card parties , the subject was necessarily dropped . Mrs . Jennings , who had watched them with pleasure while they were talking , and who expected to see the effect of Miss Dashwood ' s communication , in such an instantaneous gaiety on Colonel Brandon ' s side , as might have become a man in the bloom of youth , of hope and happiness , saw him , with amazement , remain the whole evening more serious and thoughtful than usual . CHAPTER 31"
austen#From a night of more sleep than she had expected , Marianne awoke the next morning to the same consciousness of misery in which she had closed her eyes . Elinor encouraged her as much as possible to talk of what she felt ; and before breakfast was ready , they had gone through the subject again and again ; and with the same steady conviction and affectionate counsel on Elinor ' s side , the same impetuous feelings and varying opinions on Marianne ' s , as before . Sometimes she could believe Willoughby to be as unfortunate and as innocent as herself , and at others , lost every consolation in the impossibility of acquitting him . At one moment she was absolutely indifferent to the observation of all the world , at another she would seclude herself from it for ever , and at a third could resist it with energy . In one thing , however , she was uniform , when it came to the point , in avoiding , where it was possible , the presence of Mrs . Jennings , and in a determined silence when obliged to endure it . Her heart was hardened against the belief of Mrs . Jennings ' s entering into her sorrows with any compassion .
austen#""" No , no , no , it cannot be ,"" she cried ; "" she cannot feel . Her kindness is not sympathy ; her good - nature is not tenderness . All that she wants is gossip , and she only likes me now because I supply it ."" Elinor had not needed this to be assured of the injustice to which her sister was often led in her opinion of others , by the irritable refinement of her own mind , and the too great importance placed by her on the delicacies of a strong sensibility , and the graces of a polished manner . Like half the rest of the world , if more than half there be that are clever and good , Marianne , with excellent abilities and an excellent disposition , was neither reasonable nor candid . She expected from other people the same opinions and feelings as her own , and she judged of their motives by the immediate effect of their actions on herself ."
austen#"Thus a circumstance occurred , while the sisters were together in their own room after breakfast , which sunk the heart of Mrs . Jennings still lower in her estimation ; because , through her own weakness , it chanced to prove a source of fresh pain to herself , though Mrs . Jennings was governed in it by an impulse of the utmost goodwill . With a letter in her outstretched hand , and countenance gaily smiling , from the persuasion of bringing comfort , she entered their room , saying , "" Now , my dear , I bring you something that I am sure will do you good ."" Marianne heard enough . In one moment her imagination placed before her a letter from Willoughby , full of tenderness and contrition , explanatory of all that had passed , satisfactory , convincing ; and instantly followed by Willoughby himself , rushing eagerly into the room to inforce , at her feet , by the eloquence of his eyes , the assurances of his letter . The work of one moment was destroyed by the next ."
austen#The hand writing of her mother , never till then unwelcome , was before her ; and , in the acuteness of the disappointment which followed such an ecstasy of more than hope , she felt as if , till that instant , she had never suffered . The cruelty of Mrs . Jennings no language , within her reach in her moments of happiest eloquence , could have expressed ; and now she could reproach her only by the tears which streamed from her eyes with passionate violence -- a reproach , however , so entirely lost on its object , that after many expressions of pity , she withdrew , still referring her to the letter of comfort . But the letter , when she was calm enough to read it , brought little comfort . Willoughby filled every page . Her mother , still confident of their engagement , and relying as warmly as ever on his constancy , had only been roused by Elinor ' s application , to intreat from Marianne greater openness towards them both ; and this , with such tenderness towards her , such affection for Willoughby , and such a conviction of their future happiness in each other , that she wept with agony through the whole of it . All her impatience to be at home again now returned ; her mother was dearer to her than ever ; dearer through the very excess of her mistaken confidence in Willoughby , and she was wildly urgent to be gone .
austen#"Elinor , unable herself to determine whether it were better for Marianne to be in London or at Barton , offered no counsel of her own except of patience till their mother ' s wishes could be known ; and at length she obtained her sister ' s consent to wait for that knowledge . Mrs . Jennings left them earlier than usual ; for she could not be easy till the Middletons and Palmers were able to grieve as much as herself ; and positively refusing Elinor ' s offered attendance , went out alone for the rest of the morning . Elinor , with a very heavy heart , aware of the pain she was going to communicate , and perceiving , by Marianne ' s letter , how ill she had succeeded in laying any foundation for it , then sat down to write her mother an account of what had passed , and entreat her directions for the future ; while Marianne , who came into the drawing - room on Mrs . Jennings ' s going away , remained fixed at the table where Elinor wrote , watching the advancement of her pen , grieving over her for the hardship of such a task , and grieving still more fondly over its effect on her mother . In this manner they had continued about a quarter of an hour , when Marianne , whose nerves could not then bear any sudden noise , was startled by a rap at the door . "" Who can this be ?"" cried Elinor ."
austen#""" So early too ! I thought we HAD been safe ."" Marianne moved to the window -- "" It is Colonel Brandon !"" said she , with vexation . "" We are never safe from HIM ."""
austen#""" He will not come in , as Mrs . Jennings is from home ."" "" I will not trust to THAT ,"" retreating to her own room . "" A man who has nothing to do with his own time has no conscience in his intrusion on that of others ."" The event proved her conjecture right , though it was founded on injustice and error ; for Colonel Brandon DID come in ; and Elinor , who was convinced that solicitude for Marianne brought him thither , and who saw THAT solicitude in his disturbed and melancholy look , and in his anxious though brief inquiry after her , could not forgive her sister for esteeming him so lightly . "" I met Mrs . Jennings in Bond Street ,"" said he , after the first salutation , "" and she encouraged me to come on ; and I was the more easily encouraged , because I thought it probable that I might find you alone , which I was very desirous of doing . My object -- my wish -- my sole wish in desiring it -- I hope , I believe it is -- is to be a means of giving comfort ;-- no , I must not say comfort -- not present comfort -- but conviction , lasting conviction to your sister ' s mind ."
austen#"My regard for her , for yourself , for your mother -- will you allow me to prove it , by relating some circumstances which nothing but a VERY sincere regard -- nothing but an earnest desire of being useful -- I think I am justified -- though where so many hours have been spent in convincing myself that I am right , is there not some reason to fear I may be wrong ?"" He stopped . "" I understand you ,"" said Elinor . "" You have something to tell me of Mr . Willoughby , that will open his character farther . Your telling it will be the greatest act of friendship that can be shewn Marianne . MY gratitude will be insured immediately by any information tending to that end , and HERS must be gained by it in time ."
austen#"Pray , pray let me hear it ."" "" You shall ; and , to be brief , when I quitted Barton last October ,-- but this will give you no idea -- I must go farther back . You will find me a very awkward narrator , Miss Dashwood ; I hardly know where to begin . A short account of myself , I believe , will be necessary , and it SHALL be a short one . On such a subject ,"" sighing heavily , "" can I have little temptation to be diffuse ."" He stopt a moment for recollection , and then , with another sigh , went on ."
austen#""" You have probably entirely forgotten a conversation -- ( it is not to be supposed that it could make any impression on you )-- a conversation between us one evening at Barton Park -- it was the evening of a dance -- in which I alluded to a lady I had once known , as resembling , in some measure , your sister Marianne ."" "" Indeed ,"" answered Elinor , "" I have NOT forgotten it ."" He looked pleased by this remembrance , and added , "" If I am not deceived by the uncertainty , the partiality of tender recollection , there is a very strong resemblance between them , as well in mind as person . The same warmth of heart , the same eagerness of fancy and spirits . This lady was one of my nearest relations , an orphan from her infancy , and under the guardianship of my father ."
austen#Our ages were nearly the same , and from our earliest years we were playfellows and friends . I cannot remember the time when I did not love Eliza ; and my affection for her , as we grew up , was such , as perhaps , judging from my present forlorn and cheerless gravity , you might think me incapable of having ever felt . Her ' s , for me , was , I believe , fervent as the attachment of your sister to Mr . Willoughby and it was , though from a different cause , no less unfortunate . At seventeen she was lost to me for ever . She was married -- married against her inclination to my brother . Her fortune was large , and our family estate much encumbered .
austen#And this , I fear , is all that can be said for the conduct of one , who was at once her uncle and guardian . My brother did not deserve her ; he did not even love her . I had hoped that her regard for me would support her under any difficulty , and for some time it did ; but at last the misery of her situation , for she experienced great unkindness , overcame all her resolution , and though she had promised me that nothing -- but how blindly I relate ! I have never told you how this was brought on . We were within a few hours of eloping together for Scotland . The treachery , or the folly , of my cousin ' s maid betrayed us .
austen#I was banished to the house of a relation far distant , and she was allowed no liberty , no society , no amusement , till my father ' s point was gained . I had depended on her fortitude too far , and the blow was a severe one -- but had her marriage been happy , so young as I then was , a few months must have reconciled me to it , or at least I should not have now to lament it . This however was not the case . My brother had no regard for her ; his pleasures were not what they ought to have been , and from the first he treated her unkindly . The consequence of this , upon a mind so young , so lively , so inexperienced as Mrs . Brandon ' s , was but too natural . She resigned herself at first to all the misery of her situation ; and happy had it been if she had not lived to overcome those regrets which the remembrance of me occasioned .
austen#"But can we wonder that , with such a husband to provoke inconstancy , and without a friend to advise or restrain her ( for my father lived only a few months after their marriage , and I was with my regiment in the East Indies ) she should fall ? Had I remained in England , perhaps -- but I meant to promote the happiness of both by removing from her for years , and for that purpose had procured my exchange . The shock which her marriage had given me ,"" he continued , in a voice of great agitation , "" was of trifling weight -- was nothing to what I felt when I heard , about two years afterwards , of her divorce . It was THAT which threw this gloom ,-- even now the recollection of what I suffered --"" He could say no more , and rising hastily walked for a few minutes about the room . Elinor , affected by his relation , and still more by his distress , could not speak ."
austen#"He saw her concern , and coming to her , took her hand , pressed it , and kissed it with grateful respect . A few minutes more of silent exertion enabled him to proceed with composure . "" It was nearly three years after this unhappy period before I returned to England . My first care , when I DID arrive , was of course to seek for her ; but the search was as fruitless as it was melancholy . I could not trace her beyond her first seducer , and there was every reason to fear that she had removed from him only to sink deeper in a life of sin . Her legal allowance was not adequate to her fortune , nor sufficient for her comfortable maintenance , and I learnt from my brother that the power of receiving it had been made over some months before to another person ."
austen#He imagined , and calmly could he imagine it , that her extravagance , and consequent distress , had obliged her to dispose of it for some immediate relief . At last , however , and after I had been six months in England , I DID find her . Regard for a former servant of my own , who had since fallen into misfortune , carried me to visit him in a spunging - house , where he was confined for debt ; and there , the same house , under a similar confinement , was my unfortunate sister . So altered -- so faded -- worn down by acute suffering of every kind ! hardly could I believe the melancholy and sickly figure before me , to be the remains of the lovely , blooming , healthful girl , on whom I had once doted . What I endured in so beholding her -- but I have no right to wound your feelings by attempting to describe it -- I have pained you too much already .
austen#"That she was , to all appearance , in the last stage of a consumption , was -- yes , in such a situation it was my greatest comfort . Life could do nothing for her , beyond giving time for a better preparation for death ; and that was given . I saw her placed in comfortable lodgings , and under proper attendants ; I visited her every day during the rest of her short life : I was with her in her last moments ."" Again he stopped to recover himself ; and Elinor spoke her feelings in an exclamation of tender concern , at the fate of his unfortunate friend . "" Your sister , I hope , cannot be offended ,"" said he , "" by the resemblance I have fancied between her and my poor disgraced relation . Their fates , their fortunes , cannot be the same ; and had the natural sweet disposition of the one been guarded by a firmer mind , or a happier marriage , she might have been all that you will live to see the other be ."
austen#But to what does all this lead ? I seem to have been distressing you for nothing . Ah ! Miss Dashwood -- a subject such as this -- untouched for fourteen years -- it is dangerous to handle it at all ! I WILL be more collected -- more concise . She left to my care her only child , a little girl , the offspring of her first guilty connection , who was then about three years old .
austen#She loved the child , and had always kept it with her . It was a valued , a precious trust to me ; and gladly would I have discharged it in the strictest sense , by watching over her education myself , had the nature of our situations allowed it ; but I had no family , no home ; and my little Eliza was therefore placed at school . I saw her there whenever I could , and after the death of my brother , ( which happened about five years ago , and which left to me the possession of the family property ,) she visited me at Delaford . I called her a distant relation ; but I am well aware that I have in general been suspected of a much nearer connection with her . It is now three years ago ( she had just reached her fourteenth year ,) that I removed her from school , to place her under the care of a very respectable woman , residing in Dorsetshire , who had the charge of four or five other girls of about the same time of life ; and for two years I had every reason to be pleased with her situation . But last February , almost a twelvemonth back , she suddenly disappeared .
austen#"I had allowed her , ( imprudently , as it has since turned out ,) at her earnest desire , to go to Bath with one of her young friends , who was attending her father there for his health . I knew him to be a very good sort of man , and I thought well of his daughter -- better than she deserved , for , with a most obstinate and ill - judged secrecy , she would tell nothing , would give no clue , though she certainly knew all . He , her father , a well - meaning , but not a quick - sighted man , could really , I believe , give no information ; for he had been generally confined to the house , while the girls were ranging over the town and making what acquaintance they chose ; and he tried to convince me , as thoroughly as he was convinced himself , of his daughter ' s being entirely unconcerned in the business . In short , I could learn nothing but that she was gone ; all the rest , for eight long months , was left to conjecture . What I thought , what I feared , may be imagined ; and what I suffered too ."" "" Good heavens !"""
austen#"cried Elinor , "" could it be -- could Willoughby !"" -- "" The first news that reached me of her ,"" he continued , "" came in a letter from herself , last October . It was forwarded to me from Delaford , and I received it on the very morning of our intended party to Whitwell ; and this was the reason of my leaving Barton so suddenly , which I am sure must at the time have appeared strange to every body , and which I believe gave offence to some . Little did Mr . Willoughby imagine , I suppose , when his looks censured me for incivility in breaking up the party , that I was called away to the relief of one whom he had made poor and miserable ; but HAD he known it , what would it have availed ? Would he have been less gay or less happy in the smiles of your sister ?"
austen#"No , he had already done that , which no man who CAN feel for another would do . He had left the girl whose youth and innocence he had seduced , in a situation of the utmost distress , with no creditable home , no help , no friends , ignorant of his address ! He had left her , promising to return ; he neither returned , nor wrote , nor relieved her ."" "" This is beyond every thing !"" exclaimed Elinor . "" His character is now before you ; expensive , dissipated , and worse than both ."
austen#Knowing all this , as I have now known it many weeks , guess what I must have felt on seeing your sister as fond of him as ever , and on being assured that she was to marry him : guess what I must have felt for all your sakes . When I came to you last week and found you alone , I came determined to know the truth ; though irresolute what to do when it WAS known . My behaviour must have seemed strange to you then ; but now you will comprehend it . To suffer you all to be so deceived ; to see your sister -- but what could I do ? I had no hope of interfering with success ; and sometimes I thought your sister ' s influence might yet reclaim him . But now , after such dishonorable usage , who can tell what were his designs on her .
austen#Whatever they may have been , however , she may now , and hereafter doubtless WILL turn with gratitude towards her own condition , when she compares it with that of my poor Eliza , when she considers the wretched and hopeless situation of this poor girl , and pictures her to herself , with an affection for him so strong , still as strong as her own , and with a mind tormented by self - reproach , which must attend her through life . Surely this comparison must have its use with her . She will feel her own sufferings to be nothing . They proceed from no misconduct , and can bring no disgrace . On the contrary , every friend must be made still more her friend by them . Concern for her unhappiness , and respect for her fortitude under it , must strengthen every attachment .
austen#"Use your own discretion , however , in communicating to her what I have told you . You must know best what will be its effect ; but had I not seriously , and from my heart believed it might be of service , might lessen her regrets , I would not have suffered myself to trouble you with this account of my family afflictions , with a recital which may seem to have been intended to raise myself at the expense of others ."" Elinor ' s thanks followed this speech with grateful earnestness ; attended too with the assurance of her expecting material advantage to Marianne , from the communication of what had passed . "" I have been more pained ,"" said she , "" by her endeavors to acquit him than by all the rest ; for it irritates her mind more than the most perfect conviction of his unworthiness can do . Now , though at first she will suffer much , I am sure she will soon become easier . Have you ,"" she continued , after a short silence , "" ever seen Mr . Willoughby since you left him at Barton ?"""
austen#""" Yes ,"" he replied gravely , "" once I have . One meeting was unavoidable ."" Elinor , startled by his manner , looked at him anxiously , saying , "" What ? have you met him to --"" "" I could meet him no other way ."
austen#"Eliza had confessed to me , though most reluctantly , the name of her lover ; and when he returned to town , which was within a fortnight after myself , we met by appointment , he to defend , I to punish his conduct . We returned unwounded , and the meeting , therefore , never got abroad ."" Elinor sighed over the fancied necessity of this ; but to a man and a soldier she presumed not to censure it . "" Such ,"" said Colonel Brandon , after a pause , "" has been the unhappy resemblance between the fate of mother and daughter ! and so imperfectly have I discharged my trust !"" "" Is she still in town ?"""
austen#""" No ; as soon as she recovered from her lying - in , for I found her near her delivery , I removed her and her child into the country , and there she remains ."" Recollecting , soon afterwards , that he was probably dividing Elinor from her sister , he put an end to his visit , receiving from her again the same grateful acknowledgments , and leaving her full of compassion and esteem for him . CHAPTER 32 When the particulars of this conversation were repeated by Miss Dashwood to her sister , as they very soon were , the effect on her was not entirely such as the former had hoped to see . Not that Marianne appeared to distrust the truth of any part of it , for she listened to it all with the most steady and submissive attention , made neither objection nor remark , attempted no vindication of Willoughby , and seemed to shew by her tears that she felt it to be impossible . But though this behaviour assured Elinor that the conviction of this guilt WAS carried home to her mind , though she saw with satisfaction the effect of it , in her no longer avoiding Colonel Brandon when he called , in her speaking to him , even voluntarily speaking , with a kind of compassionate respect , and though she saw her spirits less violently irritated than before , she did not see her less wretched ."
austen#Her mind did become settled , but it was settled in a gloomy dejection . She felt the loss of Willoughby ' s character yet more heavily than she had felt the loss of his heart ; his seduction and desertion of Miss Williams , the misery of that poor girl , and the doubt of what his designs might ONCE have been on herself , preyed altogether so much on her spirits , that she could not bring herself to speak of what she felt even to Elinor ; and , brooding over her sorrows in silence , gave more pain to her sister than could have been communicated by the most open and most frequent confession of them . To give the feelings or the language of Mrs . Dashwood on receiving and answering Elinor ' s letter would be only to give a repetition of what her daughters had already felt and said ; of a disappointment hardly less painful than Marianne ' s , and an indignation even greater than Elinor ' s . Long letters from her , quickly succeeding each other , arrived to tell all that she suffered and thought ; to express her anxious solicitude for Marianne , and entreat she would bear up with fortitude under this misfortune . Bad indeed must the nature of Marianne ' s affliction be , when her mother could talk of fortitude ! mortifying and humiliating must be the origin of those regrets , which SHE could wish her not to indulge !
austen#Against the interest of her own individual comfort , Mrs . Dashwood had determined that it would be better for Marianne to be any where , at that time , than at Barton , where every thing within her view would be bringing back the past in the strongest and most afflicting manner , by constantly placing Willoughby before her , such as she had always seen him there . She recommended it to her daughters , therefore , by all means not to shorten their visit to Mrs . Jennings ; the length of which , though never exactly fixed , had been expected by all to comprise at least five or six weeks . A variety of occupations , of objects , and of company , which could not be procured at Barton , would be inevitable there , and might yet , she hoped , cheat Marianne , at times , into some interest beyond herself , and even into some amusement , much as the ideas of both might now be spurned by her . From all danger of seeing Willoughby again , her mother considered her to be at least equally safe in town as in the country , since his acquaintance must now be dropped by all who called themselves her friends . Design could never bring them in each other ' s way : negligence could never leave them exposed to a surprise ; and chance had less in its favour in the crowd of London than even in the retirement of Barton , where it might force him before her while paying that visit at Allenham on his marriage , which Mrs . Dashwood , from foreseeing at first as a probable event , had brought herself to expect as a certain one . She had yet another reason for wishing her children to remain where they were ; a letter from her son - in - law had told her that he and his wife were to be in town before the middle of February , and she judged it right that they should sometimes see their brother .
austen#Marianne had promised to be guided by her mother ' s opinion , and she submitted to it therefore without opposition , though it proved perfectly different from what she wished and expected , though she felt it to be entirely wrong , formed on mistaken grounds , and that by requiring her longer continuance in London it deprived her of the only possible alleviation of her wretchedness , the personal sympathy of her mother , and doomed her to such society and such scenes as must prevent her ever knowing a moment ' s rest . But it was a matter of great consolation to her , that what brought evil to herself would bring good to her sister ; and Elinor , on the other hand , suspecting that it would not be in her power to avoid Edward entirely , comforted herself by thinking , that though their longer stay would therefore militate against her own happiness , it would be better for Marianne than an immediate return into Devonshire . Her carefulness in guarding her sister from ever hearing Willoughby ' s name mentioned , was not thrown away . Marianne , though without knowing it herself , reaped all its advantage ; for neither Mrs . Jennings , nor Sir John , nor even Mrs . Palmer herself , ever spoke of him before her . Elinor wished that the same forbearance could have extended towards herself , but that was impossible , and she was obliged to listen day after day to the indignation of them all . Sir John , could not have thought it possible .
austen#""" A man of whom he had always had such reason to think well ! Such a good - natured fellow ! He did not believe there was a bolder rider in England ! It was an unaccountable business . He wished him at the devil with all his heart . He would not speak another word to him , meet him where he might , for all the world !"
austen#"No , not if it were to be by the side of Barton covert , and they were kept watching for two hours together . Such a scoundrel of a fellow ! such a deceitful dog ! It was only the last time they met that he had offered him one of Folly ' s puppies ! and this was the end of it !"" Mrs . Palmer , in her way , was equally angry ."
austen#""" She was determined to drop his acquaintance immediately , and she was very thankful that she had never been acquainted with him at all . She wished with all her heart Combe Magna was not so near Cleveland ; but it did not signify , for it was a great deal too far off to visit ; she hated him so much that she was resolved never to mention his name again , and she should tell everybody she saw , how good - for - nothing he was ."" The rest of Mrs . Palmer ' s sympathy was shewn in procuring all the particulars in her power of the approaching marriage , and communicating them to Elinor . She could soon tell at what coachmaker ' s the new carriage was building , by what painter Mr . Willoughby ' s portrait was drawn , and at what warehouse Miss Grey ' s clothes might be seen . The calm and polite unconcern of Lady Middleton on the occasion was a happy relief to Elinor ' s spirits , oppressed as they often were by the clamorous kindness of the others . It was a great comfort to her to be sure of exciting no interest in ONE person at least among their circle of friends : a great comfort to know that there was ONE who would meet her without feeling any curiosity after particulars , or any anxiety for her sister ' s health ."
austen#"Every qualification is raised at times , by the circumstances of the moment , to more than its real value ; and she was sometimes worried down by officious condolence to rate good - breeding as more indispensable to comfort than good - nature . Lady Middleton expressed her sense of the affair about once every day , or twice , if the subject occurred very often , by saying , "" It is very shocking , indeed !"" and by the means of this continual though gentle vent , was able not only to see the Miss Dashwoods from the first without the smallest emotion , but very soon to see them without recollecting a word of the matter ; and having thus supported the dignity of her own sex , and spoken her decided censure of what was wrong in the other , she thought herself at liberty to attend to the interest of her own assemblies , and therefore determined ( though rather against the opinion of Sir John ) that as Mrs . Willoughby would at once be a woman of elegance and fortune , to leave her card with her as soon as she married . Colonel Brandon ' s delicate , unobtrusive enquiries were never unwelcome to Miss Dashwood . He had abundantly earned the privilege of intimate discussion of her sister ' s disappointment , by the friendly zeal with which he had endeavoured to soften it , and they always conversed with confidence . His chief reward for the painful exertion of disclosing past sorrows and present humiliations , was given in the pitying eye with which Marianne sometimes observed him , and the gentleness of her voice whenever ( though it did not often happen ) she was obliged , or could oblige herself to speak to him ."
austen#THESE assured him that his exertion had produced an increase of good - will towards himself , and THESE gave Elinor hopes of its being farther augmented hereafter ; but Mrs . Jennings , who knew nothing of all this , who knew only that the Colonel continued as grave as ever , and that she could neither prevail on him to make the offer himself , nor commission her to make it for him , began , at the end of two days , to think that , instead of Midsummer , they would not be married till Michaelmas , and by the end of a week that it would not be a match at all . The good understanding between the Colonel and Miss Dashwood seemed rather to declare that the honours of the mulberry - tree , the canal , and the yew arbour , would all be made over to HER ; and Mrs . Jennings had , for some time ceased to think at all of Mrs . Ferrars . Early in February , within a fortnight from the receipt of Willoughby ' s letter , Elinor had the painful office of informing her sister that he was married . She had taken care to have the intelligence conveyed to herself , as soon as it was known that the ceremony was over , as she was desirous that Marianne should not receive the first notice of it from the public papers , which she saw her eagerly examining every morning . She received the news with resolute composure ; made no observation on it , and at first shed no tears ; but after a short time they would burst out , and for the rest of the day , she was in a state hardly less pitiable than when she first learnt to expect the event . The Willoughbys left town as soon as they were married ; and Elinor now hoped , as there could be no danger of her seeing either of them , to prevail on her sister , who had never yet left the house since the blow first fell , to go out again by degrees as she had done before .
austen#"About this time the two Miss Steeles , lately arrived at their cousin ' s house in Bartlett ' s Buildings , Holburn , presented themselves again before their more grand relations in Conduit and Berkeley Streets ; and were welcomed by them all with great cordiality . Elinor only was sorry to see them . Their presence always gave her pain , and she hardly knew how to make a very gracious return to the overpowering delight of Lucy in finding her STILL in town . "" I should have been quite disappointed if I had not found you here STILL ,"" said she repeatedly , with a strong emphasis on the word . "" But I always thought I SHOULD . I was almost sure you would not leave London yet awhile ; though you TOLD me , you know , at Barton , that you should not stay above a MONTH ."
austen#"But I thought , at the time , that you would most likely change your mind when it came to the point . It would have been such a great pity to have went away before your brother and sister came . And now to be sure you will be in no hurry to be gone . I am amazingly glad you did not keep to YOUR WORD ."" Elinor perfectly understood her , and was forced to use all her self - command to make it appear that she did NOT . "" Well , my dear ,"" said Mrs . Jennings , "" and how did you travel ?"""
austen#""" Not in the stage , I assure you ,"" replied Miss Steele , with quick exultation ; "" we came post all the way , and had a very smart beau to attend us . Dr . Davies was coming to town , and so we thought we ' d join him in a post - chaise ; and he behaved very genteelly , and paid ten or twelve shillings more than we did ."" "" Oh , oh !"" cried Mrs . Jennings ; "" very pretty , indeed ! and the Doctor is a single man , I warrant you ."" "" There now ,"" said Miss Steele , affectedly simpering , "" everybody laughs at me so about the Doctor , and I cannot think why ."
austen#"My cousins say they are sure I have made a conquest ; but for my part I declare I never think about him from one hour ' s end to another . ' Lord ! here comes your beau , Nancy ,' my cousin said t ' other day , when she saw him crossing the street to the house . My beau , indeed ! said I -- I cannot think who you mean . The Doctor is no beau of mine ."""
austen#""" Aye , aye , that is very pretty talking -- but it won ' t do -- the Doctor is the man , I see ."" "" No , indeed !"" replied her cousin , with affected earnestness , "" and I beg you will contradict it , if you ever hear it talked of ."" Mrs . Jennings directly gave her the gratifying assurance that she certainly would NOT , and Miss Steele was made completely happy . "" I suppose you will go and stay with your brother and sister , Miss Dashwood , when they come to town ,"" said Lucy , returning , after a cessation of hostile hints , to the charge . "" No , I do not think we shall ."""
austen#""" Oh , yes , I dare say you will ."" Elinor would not humour her by farther opposition . "" What a charming thing it is that Mrs . Dashwood can spare you both for so long a time together !"" "" Long a time , indeed !"" interposed Mrs . Jennings . "" Why , their visit is but just begun !"""
austen#"Lucy was silenced . "" I am sorry we cannot see your sister , Miss Dashwood ,"" said Miss Steele . "" I am sorry she is not well --"" for Marianne had left the room on their arrival . "" You are very good . My sister will be equally sorry to miss the pleasure of seeing you ; but she has been very much plagued lately with nervous head - aches , which make her unfit for company or conversation ."" "" Oh , dear , that is a great pity !"
austen#"but such old friends as Lucy and me !-- I think she might see US ; and I am sure we would not speak a word ."" Elinor , with great civility , declined the proposal . Her sister was perhaps laid down upon the bed , or in her dressing gown , and therefore not able to come to them . "" Oh , if that ' s all ,"" cried Miss Steele , "" we can just as well go and see HER ."" Elinor began to find this impertinence too much for her temper ; but she was saved the trouble of checking it , by Lucy ' s sharp reprimand , which now , as on many occasions , though it did not give much sweetness to the manners of one sister , was of advantage in governing those of the other . CHAPTER 33"
austen#After some opposition , Marianne yielded to her sister ' s entreaties , and consented to go out with her and Mrs . Jennings one morning for half an hour . She expressly conditioned , however , for paying no visits , and would do no more than accompany them to Gray ' s in Sackville Street , where Elinor was carrying on a negotiation for the exchange of a few old - fashioned jewels of her mother . When they stopped at the door , Mrs . Jennings recollected that there was a lady at the other end of the street on whom she ought to call ; and as she had no business at Gray ' s , it was resolved , that while her young friends transacted their ' s , she should pay her visit and return for them . On ascending the stairs , the Miss Dashwoods found so many people before them in the room , that there was not a person at liberty to tend to their orders ; and they were obliged to wait . All that could be done was , to sit down at that end of the counter which seemed to promise the quickest succession ; one gentleman only was standing there , and it is probable that Elinor was not without hope of exciting his politeness to a quicker despatch . But the correctness of his eye , and the delicacy of his taste , proved to be beyond his politeness .
austen#He was giving orders for a toothpick - case for himself , and till its size , shape , and ornaments were determined , all of which , after examining and debating for a quarter of an hour over every toothpick - case in the shop , were finally arranged by his own inventive fancy , he had no leisure to bestow any other attention on the two ladies , than what was comprised in three or four very broad stares ; a kind of notice which served to imprint on Elinor the remembrance of a person and face , of strong , natural , sterling insignificance , though adorned in the first style of fashion . Marianne was spared from the troublesome feelings of contempt and resentment , on this impertinent examination of their features , and on the puppyism of his manner in deciding on all the different horrors of the different toothpick - cases presented to his inspection , by remaining unconscious of it all ; for she was as well able to collect her thoughts within herself , and be as ignorant of what was passing around her , in Mr . Gray ' s shop , as in her own bedroom . At last the affair was decided . The ivory , the gold , and the pearls , all received their appointment , and the gentleman having named the last day on which his existence could be continued without the possession of the toothpick - case , drew on his gloves with leisurely care , and bestowing another glance on the Miss Dashwoods , but such a one as seemed rather to demand than express admiration , walked off with a happy air of real conceit and affected indifference . Elinor lost no time in bringing her business forward , was on the point of concluding it , when another gentleman presented himself at her side . She turned her eyes towards his face , and found him with some surprise to be her brother .
austen#"Their affection and pleasure in meeting was just enough to make a very creditable appearance in Mr . Gray ' s shop . John Dashwood was really far from being sorry to see his sisters again ; it rather gave them satisfaction ; and his inquiries after their mother were respectful and attentive . Elinor found that he and Fanny had been in town two days . "" I wished very much to call upon you yesterday ,"" said he , "" but it was impossible , for we were obliged to take Harry to see the wild beasts at Exeter Exchange ; and we spent the rest of the day with Mrs . Ferrars . Harry was vastly pleased . THIS morning I had fully intended to call on you , if I could possibly find a spare half hour , but one has always so much to do on first coming to town ."
austen#"I am come here to bespeak Fanny a seal . But tomorrow I think I shall certainly be able to call in Berkeley Street , and be introduced to your friend Mrs . Jennings . I understand she is a woman of very good fortune . And the Middletons too , you must introduce me to THEM . As my mother - in - law ' s relations , I shall be happy to show them every respect . They are excellent neighbours to you in the country , I understand ."""
austen#""" Excellent indeed . Their attention to our comfort , their friendliness in every particular , is more than I can express ."" "" I am extremely glad to hear it , upon my word ; extremely glad indeed . But so it ought to be ; they are people of large fortune , they are related to you , and every civility and accommodation that can serve to make your situation pleasant might be reasonably expected . And so you are most comfortably settled in your little cottage and want for nothing ! Edward brought us a most charming account of the place : the most complete thing of its kind , he said , that ever was , and you all seemed to enjoy it beyond any thing ."
austen#"It was a great satisfaction to us to hear it , I assure you ."" Elinor did feel a little ashamed of her brother ; and was not sorry to be spared the necessity of answering him , by the arrival of Mrs . Jennings ' s servant , who came to tell her that his mistress waited for them at the door . Mr . Dashwood attended them down stairs , was introduced to Mrs . Jennings at the door of her carriage , and repeating his hope of being able to call on them the next day , took leave . His visit was duly paid . He came with a pretence at an apology from their sister - in - law , for not coming too ; "" but she was so much engaged with her mother , that really she had no leisure for going any where ."" Mrs . Jennings , however , assured him directly , that she should not stand upon ceremony , for they were all cousins , or something like it , and she should certainly wait on Mrs . John Dashwood very soon , and bring her sisters to see her ."
austen#"His manners to THEM , though calm , were perfectly kind ; to Mrs . Jennings , most attentively civil ; and on Colonel Brandon ' s coming in soon after himself , he eyed him with a curiosity which seemed to say , that he only wanted to know him to be rich , to be equally civil to HIM . After staying with them half an hour , he asked Elinor to walk with him to Conduit Street , and introduce him to Sir John and Lady Middleton . The weather was remarkably fine , and she readily consented . As soon as they were out of the house , his enquiries began . "" Who is Colonel Brandon ? Is he a man of fortune ?"""
austen#""" Yes ; he has very good property in Dorsetshire ."" "" I am glad of it . He seems a most gentlemanlike man ; and I think , Elinor , I may congratulate you on the prospect of a very respectable establishment in life ."" "" Me , brother ! what do you mean ?"" "" He likes you ."
austen#"I observed him narrowly , and am convinced of it . What is the amount of his fortune ?"" "" I believe about two thousand a year ."" "" Two thousand a - year ;"" and then working himself up to a pitch of enthusiastic generosity , he added , "" Elinor , I wish with all my heart it were TWICE as much , for your sake ."" "" Indeed I believe you ,"" replied Elinor ; "" but I am very sure that Colonel Brandon has not the smallest wish of marrying ME ."" "" You are mistaken , Elinor ; you are very much mistaken ."
austen#A very little trouble on your side secures him . Perhaps just at present he may be undecided ; the smallness of your fortune may make him hang back ; his friends may all advise him against it . But some of those little attentions and encouragements which ladies can so easily give will fix him , in spite of himself . And there can be no reason why you should not try for him . It is not to be supposed that any prior attachment on your side -- in short , you know as to an attachment of that kind , it is quite out of the question , the objections are insurmountable -- you have too much sense not to see all that . Colonel Brandon must be the man ; and no civility shall be wanting on my part to make him pleased with you and your family .
austen#"It is a match that must give universal satisfaction . In short , it is a kind of thing that ""-- lowering his voice to an important whisper --"" will be exceedingly welcome to ALL PARTIES ."" Recollecting himself , however , he added , "" That is , I mean to say -- your friends are all truly anxious to see you well settled ; Fanny particularly , for she has your interest very much at heart , I assure you . And her mother too , Mrs . Ferrars , a very good - natured woman , I am sure it would give her great pleasure ; she said as much the other day ."" Elinor would not vouchsafe any answer . "" It would be something remarkable , now ,"" he continued , "" something droll , if Fanny should have a brother and I a sister settling at the same time ."
austen#"And yet it is not very unlikely ."" "" Is Mr . Edward Ferrars ,"" said Elinor , with resolution , "" going to be married ?"" "" It is not actually settled , but there is such a thing in agitation . He has a most excellent mother . Mrs . Ferrars , with the utmost liberality , will come forward , and settle on him a thousand a year , if the match takes place . The lady is the Hon ."
austen#"Miss Morton , only daughter of the late Lord Morton , with thirty thousand pounds . A very desirable connection on both sides , and I have not a doubt of its taking place in time . A thousand a - year is a great deal for a mother to give away , to make over for ever ; but Mrs . Ferrars has a noble spirit . To give you another instance of her liberality :-- The other day , as soon as we came to town , aware that money could not be very plenty with us just now , she put bank - notes into Fanny ' s hands to the amount of two hundred pounds . And extremely acceptable it is , for we must live at a great expense while we are here ."" He paused for her assent and compassion ; and she forced herself to say ,"
austen#""" Your expenses both in town and country must certainly be considerable ; but your income is a large one ."" "" Not so large , I dare say , as many people suppose . I do not mean to complain , however ; it is undoubtedly a comfortable one , and I hope will in time be better . The enclosure of Norland Common , now carrying on , is a most serious drain . And then I have made a little purchase within this half year ; East Kingham Farm , you must remember the place , where old Gibson used to live . The land was so very desirable for me in every respect , so immediately adjoining my own property , that I felt it my duty to buy it ."
austen#"I could not have answered it to my conscience to let it fall into any other hands . A man must pay for his convenience ; and it HAS cost me a vast deal of money ."" "" More than you think it really and intrinsically worth ."" "" Why , I hope not that . I might have sold it again , the next day , for more than I gave : but , with regard to the purchase - money , I might have been very unfortunate indeed ; for the stocks were at that time so low , that if I had not happened to have the necessary sum in my banker ' s hands , I must have sold out to very great loss ."" Elinor could only smile ."
austen#""" Other great and inevitable expenses too we have had on first coming to Norland . Our respected father , as you well know , bequeathed all the Stanhill effects that remained at Norland ( and very valuable they were ) to your mother . Far be it from me to repine at his doing so ; he had an undoubted right to dispose of his own property as he chose , but , in consequence of it , we have been obliged to make large purchases of linen , china , & c . to supply the place of what was taken away . You may guess , after all these expenses , how very far we must be from being rich , and how acceptable Mrs . Ferrars ' s kindness is ."" "" Certainly ,"" said Elinor ; "" and assisted by her liberality , I hope you may yet live to be in easy circumstances ."" "" Another year or two may do much towards it ,"" he gravely replied ; "" but however there is still a great deal to be done ."
austen#"There is not a stone laid of Fanny ' s green - house , and nothing but the plan of the flower - garden marked out ."" "" Where is the green - house to be ?"" "" Upon the knoll behind the house . The old walnut trees are all come down to make room for it . It will be a very fine object from many parts of the park , and the flower - garden will slope down just before it , and be exceedingly pretty . We have cleared away all the old thorns that grew in patches over the brow ."""
austen#"Elinor kept her concern and her censure to herself ; and was very thankful that Marianne was not present , to share the provocation . Having now said enough to make his poverty clear , and to do away the necessity of buying a pair of ear - rings for each of his sisters , in his next visit at Gray ' s his thoughts took a cheerfuller turn , and he began to congratulate Elinor on having such a friend as Mrs . Jennings . "" She seems a most valuable woman indeed -- Her house , her style of living , all bespeak an exceeding good income ; and it is an acquaintance that has not only been of great use to you hitherto , but in the end may prove materially advantageous .-- Her inviting you to town is certainly a vast thing in your favour ; and indeed , it speaks altogether so great a regard for you , that in all probability when she dies you will not be forgotten .-- She must have a great deal to leave ."" "" Nothing at all , I should rather suppose ; for she has only her jointure , which will descend to her children ."" "" But it is not to be imagined that she lives up to her income . Few people of common prudence will do THAT ; and whatever she saves , she will be able to dispose of ."""
austen#""" And do you not think it more likely that she should leave it to her daughters , than to us ?"" "" Her daughters are both exceedingly well married , and therefore I cannot perceive the necessity of her remembering them farther . Whereas , in my opinion , by her taking so much notice of you , and treating you in this kind of way , she has given you a sort of claim on her future consideration , which a conscientious woman would not disregard . Nothing can be kinder than her behaviour ; and she can hardly do all this , without being aware of the expectation it raises ."" "" But she raises none in those most concerned . Indeed , brother , your anxiety for our welfare and prosperity carries you too far ."""
austen#""" Why , to be sure ,"" said he , seeming to recollect himself , "" people have little , have very little in their power . But , my dear Elinor , what is the matter with Marianne ?-- she looks very unwell , has lost her colour , and is grown quite thin . Is she ill ?"" "" She is not well , she has had a nervous complaint on her for several weeks ."" "" I am sorry for that . At her time of life , any thing of an illness destroys the bloom for ever !"
austen#Her ' s has been a very short one ! She was as handsome a girl last September , as I ever saw ; and as likely to attract the man . There was something in her style of beauty , to please them particularly . I remember Fanny used to say that she would marry sooner and better than you did ; not but what she is exceedingly fond of YOU , but so it happened to strike her . She will be mistaken , however . I question whether Marianne NOW , will marry a man worth more than five or six hundred a - year , at the utmost , and I am very much deceived if YOU do not do better .
austen#"Dorsetshire ! I know very little of Dorsetshire ; but , my dear Elinor , I shall be exceedingly glad to know more of it ; and I think I can answer for your having Fanny and myself among the earliest and best pleased of your visitors ."" Elinor tried very seriously to convince him that there was no likelihood of her marrying Colonel Brandon ; but it was an expectation of too much pleasure to himself to be relinquished , and he was really resolved on seeking an intimacy with that gentleman , and promoting the marriage by every possible attention . He had just compunction enough for having done nothing for his sisters himself , to be exceedingly anxious that everybody else should do a great deal ; and an offer from Colonel Brandon , or a legacy from Mrs . Jennings , was the easiest means of atoning for his own neglect . They were lucky enough to find Lady Middleton at home , and Sir John came in before their visit ended . Abundance of civilities passed on all sides ."
austen#"Sir John was ready to like anybody , and though Mr . Dashwood did not seem to know much about horses , he soon set him down as a very good - natured fellow : while Lady Middleton saw enough of fashion in his appearance to think his acquaintance worth having ; and Mr . Dashwood went away delighted with both . "" I shall have a charming account to carry to Fanny ,"" said he , as he walked back with his sister . "" Lady Middleton is really a most elegant woman ! Such a woman as I am sure Fanny will be glad to know . And Mrs . Jennings too , an exceedingly well - behaved woman , though not so elegant as her daughter . Your sister need not have any scruple even of visiting HER , which , to say the truth , has been a little the case , and very naturally ; for we only knew that Mrs . Jennings was the widow of a man who had got all his money in a low way ; and Fanny and Mrs . Ferrars were both strongly prepossessed , that neither she nor her daughters were such kind of women as Fanny would like to associate with ."
austen#"But now I can carry her a most satisfactory account of both ."" CHAPTER 34 Mrs . John Dashwood had so much confidence in her husband ' s judgment , that she waited the very next day both on Mrs . Jennings and her daughter ; and her confidence was rewarded by finding even the former , even the woman with whom her sisters were staying , by no means unworthy her notice ; and as for Lady Middleton , she found her one of the most charming women in the world ! Lady Middleton was equally pleased with Mrs . Dashwood . There was a kind of cold hearted selfishness on both sides , which mutually attracted them ; and they sympathised with each other in an insipid propriety of demeanor , and a general want of understanding . The same manners , however , which recommended Mrs . John Dashwood to the good opinion of Lady Middleton did not suit the fancy of Mrs . Jennings , and to HER she appeared nothing more than a little proud - looking woman of uncordial address , who met her husband ' s sisters without any affection , and almost without having anything to say to them ; for of the quarter of an hour bestowed on Berkeley Street , she sat at least seven minutes and a half in silence ."
austen#Elinor wanted very much to know , though she did not chuse to ask , whether Edward was then in town ; but nothing would have induced Fanny voluntarily to mention his name before her , till able to tell her that his marriage with Miss Morton was resolved on , or till her husband ' s expectations on Colonel Brandon were answered ; because she believed them still so very much attached to each other , that they could not be too sedulously divided in word and deed on every occasion . The intelligence however , which SHE would not give , soon flowed from another quarter . Lucy came very shortly to claim Elinor ' s compassion on being unable to see Edward , though he had arrived in town with Mr . and Mrs . Dashwood . He dared not come to Bartlett ' s Buildings for fear of detection , and though their mutual impatience to meet , was not to be told , they could do nothing at present but write . Edward assured them himself of his being in town , within a very short time , by twice calling in Berkeley Street . Twice was his card found on the table , when they returned from their morning ' s engagements .
austen#Elinor was pleased that he had called ; and still more pleased that she had missed him . The Dashwoods were so prodigiously delighted with the Middletons , that , though not much in the habit of giving anything , they determined to give them -- a dinner ; and soon after their acquaintance began , invited them to dine in Harley Street , where they had taken a very good house for three months . Their sisters and Mrs . Jennings were invited likewise , and John Dashwood was careful to secure Colonel Brandon , who , always glad to be where the Miss Dashwoods were , received his eager civilities with some surprise , but much more pleasure . They were to meet Mrs . Ferrars ; but Elinor could not learn whether her sons were to be of the party . The expectation of seeing HER , however , was enough to make her interested in the engagement ; for though she could now meet Edward ' s mother without that strong anxiety which had once promised to attend such an introduction , though she could now see her with perfect indifference as to her opinion of herself , her desire of being in company with Mrs . Ferrars , her curiosity to know what she was like , was as lively as ever . The interest with which she thus anticipated the party , was soon afterwards increased , more powerfully than pleasantly , by her hearing that the Miss Steeles were also to be at it .
austen#So well had they recommended themselves to Lady Middleton , so agreeable had their assiduities made them to her , that though Lucy was certainly not so elegant , and her sister not even genteel , she was as ready as Sir John to ask them to spend a week or two in Conduit Street ; and it happened to be particularly convenient to the Miss Steeles , as soon as the Dashwoods ' invitation was known , that their visit should begin a few days before the party took place . Their claims to the notice of Mrs . John Dashwood , as the nieces of the gentleman who for many years had had the care of her brother , might not have done much , however , towards procuring them seats at her table ; but as Lady Middleton ' s guests they must be welcome ; and Lucy , who had long wanted to be personally known to the family , to have a nearer view of their characters and her own difficulties , and to have an opportunity of endeavouring to please them , had seldom been happier in her life , than she was on receiving Mrs . John Dashwood ' s card . On Elinor its effect was very different . She began immediately to determine , that Edward who lived with his mother , must be asked as his mother was , to a party given by his sister ; and to see him for the first time , after all that passed , in the company of Lucy !-- she hardly knew how she could bear it ! These apprehensions , perhaps , were not founded entirely on reason , and certainly not at all on truth . They were relieved however , not by her own recollection , but by the good will of Lucy , who believed herself to be inflicting a severe disappointment when she told her that Edward certainly would not be in Harley Street on Tuesday , and even hoped to be carrying the pain still farther by persuading her that he was kept away by the extreme affection for herself , which he could not conceal when they were together .
austen#"The important Tuesday came that was to introduce the two young ladies to this formidable mother - in - law . "" Pity me , dear Miss Dashwood !"" said Lucy , as they walked up the stairs together -- for the Middletons arrived so directly after Mrs . Jennings , that they all followed the servant at the same time --"" There is nobody here but you , that can feel for me .-- I declare I can hardly stand . Good gracious !-- In a moment I shall see the person that all my happiness depends on -- that is to be my mother !"" -- Elinor could have given her immediate relief by suggesting the possibility of its being Miss Morton ' s mother , rather than her own , whom they were about to behold ; but instead of doing that , she assured her , and with great sincerity , that she did pity her -- to the utter amazement of Lucy , who , though really uncomfortable herself , hoped at least to be an object of irrepressible envy to Elinor ."
austen#Mrs . Ferrars was a little , thin woman , upright , even to formality , in her figure , and serious , even to sourness , in her aspect . Her complexion was sallow ; and her features small , without beauty , and naturally without expression ; but a lucky contraction of the brow had rescued her countenance from the disgrace of insipidity , by giving it the strong characters of pride and ill nature . She was not a woman of many words ; for , unlike people in general , she proportioned them to the number of her ideas ; and of the few syllables that did escape her , not one fell to the share of Miss Dashwood , whom she eyed with the spirited determination of disliking her at all events . Elinor could not NOW be made unhappy by this behaviour .-- A few months ago it would have hurt her exceedingly ; but it was not in Mrs . Ferrars ' power to distress her by it now ;-- and the difference of her manners to the Miss Steeles , a difference which seemed purposely made to humble her more , only amused her . She could not but smile to see the graciousness of both mother and daughter towards the very person -- for Lucy was particularly distinguished -- whom of all others , had they known as much as she did , they would have been most anxious to mortify ; while she herself , who had comparatively no power to wound them , sat pointedly slighted by both . But while she smiled at a graciousness so misapplied , she could not reflect on the mean - spirited folly from which it sprung , nor observe the studied attentions with which the Miss Steeles courted its continuance , without thoroughly despising them all four .
austen#Lucy was all exultation on being so honorably distinguished ; and Miss Steele wanted only to be teazed about Dr . Davies to be perfectly happy . The dinner was a grand one , the servants were numerous , and every thing bespoke the Mistress ' s inclination for show , and the Master ' s ability to support it . In spite of the improvements and additions which were making to the Norland estate , and in spite of its owner having once been within some thousand pounds of being obliged to sell out at a loss , nothing gave any symptom of that indigence which he had tried to infer from it ;-- no poverty of any kind , except of conversation , appeared -- but there , the deficiency was considerable . John Dashwood had not much to say for himself that was worth hearing , and his wife had still less . But there was no peculiar disgrace in this ; for it was very much the case with the chief of their visitors , who almost all laboured under one or other of these disqualifications for being agreeable -- Want of sense , either natural or improved -- want of elegance -- want of spirits -- or want of temper . When the ladies withdrew to the drawing - room after dinner , this poverty was particularly evident , for the gentlemen HAD supplied the discourse with some variety -- the variety of politics , inclosing land , and breaking horses -- but then it was all over ; and one subject only engaged the ladies till coffee came in , which was the comparative heights of Harry Dashwood , and Lady Middleton ' s second son William , who were nearly of the same age .
austen#Had both the children been there , the affair might have been determined too easily by measuring them at once ; but as Harry only was present , it was all conjectural assertion on both sides ; and every body had a right to be equally positive in their opinion , and to repeat it over and over again as often as they liked . The parties stood thus : The two mothers , though each really convinced that her own son was the tallest , politely decided in favour of the other . The two grandmothers , with not less partiality , but more sincerity , were equally earnest in support of their own descendant . Lucy , who was hardly less anxious to please one parent than the other , thought the boys were both remarkably tall for their age , and could not conceive that there could be the smallest difference in the world between them ; and Miss Steele , with yet greater address gave it , as fast as she could , in favour of each . Elinor , having once delivered her opinion on William ' s side , by which she offended Mrs . Ferrars and Fanny still more , did not see the necessity of enforcing it by any farther assertion ; and Marianne , when called on for her ' s , offended them all , by declaring that she had no opinion to give , as she had never thought about it .
austen#"Before her removing from Norland , Elinor had painted a very pretty pair of screens for her sister - in - law , which being now just mounted and brought home , ornamented her present drawing room ; and these screens , catching the eye of John Dashwood on his following the other gentlemen into the room , were officiously handed by him to Colonel Brandon for his admiration . "" These are done by my eldest sister ,"" said he ; "" and you , as a man of taste , will , I dare say , be pleased with them . I do not know whether you have ever happened to see any of her performances before , but she is in general reckoned to draw extremely well ."" The Colonel , though disclaiming all pretensions to connoisseurship , warmly admired the screens , as he would have done any thing painted by Miss Dashwood ; and on the curiosity of the others being of course excited , they were handed round for general inspection . Mrs . Ferrars , not aware of their being Elinor ' s work , particularly requested to look at them ; and after they had received gratifying testimony of Lady Middletons ' s approbation , Fanny presented them to her mother , considerately informing her , at the same time , that they were done by Miss Dashwood . "" Hum ""-- said Mrs . Ferrars --"" very pretty ,""-- and without regarding them at all , returned them to her daughter ."
austen#"Perhaps Fanny thought for a moment that her mother had been quite rude enough ,-- for , colouring a little , she immediately said , "" They are very pretty , ma ' am -- an ' t they ?"" But then again , the dread of having been too civil , too encouraging herself , probably came over her , for she presently added , "" Do you not think they are something in Miss Morton ' s style of painting , Ma ' am ?-- She DOES paint most delightfully !-- How beautifully her last landscape is done !"" "" Beautifully indeed ! But SHE does every thing well ."""
austen#"Marianne could not bear this .-- She was already greatly displeased with Mrs . Ferrars ; and such ill - timed praise of another , at Elinor ' s expense , though she had not any notion of what was principally meant by it , provoked her immediately to say with warmth , "" This is admiration of a very particular kind !-- what is Miss Morton to us ?-- who knows , or who cares , for her ?-- it is Elinor of whom WE think and speak ."" And so saying , she took the screens out of her sister - in - law ' s hands , to admire them herself as they ought to be admired . Mrs . Ferrars looked exceedingly angry , and drawing herself up more stiffly than ever , pronounced in retort this bitter philippic , "" Miss Morton is Lord Morton ' s daughter ."" Fanny looked very angry too , and her husband was all in a fright at his sister ' s audacity . Elinor was much more hurt by Marianne ' s warmth than she had been by what produced it ; but Colonel Brandon ' s eyes , as they were fixed on Marianne , declared that he noticed only what was amiable in it , the affectionate heart which could not bear to see a sister slighted in the smallest point ."
austen#"Marianne ' s feelings did not stop here . The cold insolence of Mrs . Ferrars ' s general behaviour to her sister , seemed , to her , to foretell such difficulties and distresses to Elinor , as her own wounded heart taught her to think of with horror ; and urged by a strong impulse of affectionate sensibility , she moved after a moment , to her sister ' s chair , and putting one arm round her neck , and one cheek close to hers , said in a low , but eager , voice , "" Dear , dear Elinor , don ' t mind them . Don ' t let them make YOU unhappy ."" She could say no more ; her spirits were quite overcome , and hiding her face on Elinor ' s shoulder , she burst into tears . Every body ' s attention was called , and almost every body was concerned .-- Colonel Brandon rose up and went to them without knowing what he did .-- Mrs ."
austen#"Jennings , with a very intelligent "" Ah ! poor dear ,"" immediately gave her her salts ; and Sir John felt so desperately enraged against the author of this nervous distress , that he instantly changed his seat to one close by Lucy Steele , and gave her , in a whisper , a brief account of the whole shocking affair . In a few minutes , however , Marianne was recovered enough to put an end to the bustle , and sit down among the rest ; though her spirits retained the impression of what had passed , the whole evening . "" Poor Marianne !"" said her brother to Colonel Brandon , in a low voice , as soon as he could secure his attention ,-- "" She has not such good health as her sister ,-- she is very nervous ,-- she has not Elinor ' s constitution ;-- and one must allow that there is something very trying to a young woman who HAS BEEN a beauty in the loss of her personal attractions . You would not think it perhaps , but Marianne WAS remarkably handsome a few months ago ; quite as handsome as Elinor .-- Now you see it is all gone ."""
austen#CHAPTER 35 Elinor ' s curiosity to see Mrs . Ferrars was satisfied .-- She had found in her every thing that could tend to make a farther connection between the families undesirable .-- She had seen enough of her pride , her meanness , and her determined prejudice against herself , to comprehend all the difficulties that must have perplexed the engagement , and retarded the marriage , of Edward and herself , had he been otherwise free ;-- and she had seen almost enough to be thankful for her OWN sake , that one greater obstacle preserved her from suffering under any other of Mrs . Ferrars ' s creation , preserved her from all dependence upon her caprice , or any solicitude for her good opinion . Or at least , if she did not bring herself quite to rejoice in Edward ' s being fettered to Lucy , she determined , that had Lucy been more amiable , she OUGHT to have rejoiced . She wondered that Lucy ' s spirits could be so very much elevated by the civility of Mrs . Ferrars ;-- that her interest and her vanity should so very much blind her as to make the attention which seemed only paid her because she was NOT ELINOR , appear a compliment to herself -- or to allow her to derive encouragement from a preference only given her , because her real situation was unknown . But that it was so , had not only been declared by Lucy ' s eyes at the time , but was declared over again the next morning more openly , for at her particular desire , Lady Middleton set her down in Berkeley Street on the chance of seeing Elinor alone , to tell her how happy she was . The chance proved a lucky one , for a message from Mrs . Palmer soon after she arrived , carried Mrs . Jennings away .
austen#""" My dear friend ,"" cried Lucy , as soon as they were by themselves , "" I come to talk to you of my happiness . Could anything be so flattering as Mrs . Ferrars ' s way of treating me yesterday ? So exceeding affable as she was !-- You know how I dreaded the thoughts of seeing her ;-- but the very moment I was introduced , there was such an affability in her behaviour as really should seem to say , she had quite took a fancy to me . Now was not it so ?-- You saw it all ; and was not you quite struck with it ?"" "" She was certainly very civil to you ."" "" Civil !-- Did you see nothing but only civility ?-- I saw a vast deal more ."
austen#"Such kindness as fell to the share of nobody but me !-- No pride , no hauteur , and your sister just the same -- all sweetness and affability !"" Elinor wished to talk of something else , but Lucy still pressed her to own that she had reason for her happiness ; and Elinor was obliged to go on .-- "" Undoubtedly , if they had known your engagement ,"" said she , "" nothing could be more flattering than their treatment of you ;-- but as that was not the case ""-- "" I guessed you would say so ""-- replied Lucy quickly --"" but there was no reason in the world why Mrs . Ferrars should seem to like me , if she did not , and her liking me is every thing . You shan ' t talk me out of my satisfaction . I am sure it will all end well , and there will be no difficulties at all , to what I used to think ."
austen#"Mrs . Ferrars is a charming woman , and so is your sister . They are both delightful women , indeed !-- I wonder I should never hear you say how agreeable Mrs . Dashwood was !"" To this Elinor had no answer to make , and did not attempt any . "" Are you ill , Miss Dashwood ?-- you seem low -- you don ' t speak ;-- sure you an ' t well ."" "" I never was in better health ."" "" I am glad of it with all my heart ; but really you did not look it ."
austen#"I should be sorry to have YOU ill ; you , that have been the greatest comfort to me in the world !-- Heaven knows what I should have done without your friendship ."" -- Elinor tried to make a civil answer , though doubting her own success . But it seemed to satisfy Lucy , for she directly replied , "" Indeed I am perfectly convinced of your regard for me , and next to Edward ' s love , it is the greatest comfort I have .-- Poor Edward !-- But now there is one good thing , we shall be able to meet , and meet pretty often , for Lady Middleton ' s delighted with Mrs . Dashwood , so we shall be a good deal in Harley Street , I dare say , and Edward spends half his time with his sister -- besides , Lady Middleton and Mrs . Ferrars will visit now ;-- and Mrs . Ferrars and your sister were both so good to say more than once , they should always be glad to see me .-- They are such charming women !-- I am sure if ever you tell your sister what I think of her , you cannot speak too high ."" But Elinor would not give her any encouragement to hope that she SHOULD tell her sister ."
austen#"Lucy continued . "" I am sure I should have seen it in a moment , if Mrs . Ferrars had took a dislike to me . If she had only made me a formal courtesy , for instance , without saying a word , and never after had took any notice of me , and never looked at me in a pleasant way -- you know what I mean -- if I had been treated in that forbidding sort of way , I should have gave it all up in despair . I could not have stood it . For where she DOES dislike , I know it is most violent ."" Elinor was prevented from making any reply to this civil triumph , by the door ' s being thrown open , the servant ' s announcing Mr . Ferrars , and Edward ' s immediately walking in ."
austen#It was a very awkward moment ; and the countenance of each shewed that it was so . They all looked exceedingly foolish ; and Edward seemed to have as great an inclination to walk out of the room again , as to advance farther into it . The very circumstance , in its unpleasantest form , which they would each have been most anxious to avoid , had fallen on them .-- They were not only all three together , but were together without the relief of any other person . The ladies recovered themselves first . It was not Lucy ' s business to put herself forward , and the appearance of secrecy must still be kept up . She could therefore only LOOK her tenderness , and after slightly addressing him , said no more .
austen#But Elinor had more to do ; and so anxious was she , for his sake and her own , to do it well , that she forced herself , after a moment ' s recollection , to welcome him , with a look and manner that were almost easy , and almost open ; and another struggle , another effort still improved them . She would not allow the presence of Lucy , nor the consciousness of some injustice towards herself , to deter her from saying that she was happy to see him , and that she had very much regretted being from home , when he called before in Berkeley Street . She would not be frightened from paying him those attentions which , as a friend and almost a relation , were his due , by the observant eyes of Lucy , though she soon perceived them to be narrowly watching her . Her manners gave some re - assurance to Edward , and he had courage enough to sit down ; but his embarrassment still exceeded that of the ladies in a proportion , which the case rendered reasonable , though his sex might make it rare ; for his heart had not the indifference of Lucy ' s , nor could his conscience have quite the ease of Elinor ' s . Lucy , with a demure and settled air , seemed determined to make no contribution to the comfort of the others , and would not say a word ; and almost every thing that WAS said , proceeded from Elinor , who was obliged to volunteer all the information about her mother ' s health , their coming to town , & c . which Edward ought to have inquired about , but never did . Her exertions did not stop here ; for she soon afterwards felt herself so heroically disposed as to determine , under pretence of fetching Marianne , to leave the others by themselves ; and she really did it , and THAT in the handsomest manner , for she loitered away several minutes on the landing - place , with the most high - minded fortitude , before she went to her sister .
austen#"When that was once done , however , it was time for the raptures of Edward to cease ; for Marianne ' s joy hurried her into the drawing - room immediately . Her pleasure in seeing him was like every other of her feelings , strong in itself , and strongly spoken . She met him with a hand that would be taken , and a voice that expressed the affection of a sister . "" Dear Edward !"" she cried , "" this is a moment of great happiness !-- This would almost make amends for every thing ?"" Edward tried to return her kindness as it deserved , but before such witnesses he dared not say half what he really felt ."
austen#"Again they all sat down , and for a moment or two all were silent ; while Marianne was looking with the most speaking tenderness , sometimes at Edward and sometimes at Elinor , regretting only that their delight in each other should be checked by Lucy ' s unwelcome presence . Edward was the first to speak , and it was to notice Marianne ' s altered looks , and express his fear of her not finding London agree with her . "" Oh , don ' t think of me !"" she replied with spirited earnestness , though her eyes were filled with tears as she spoke , "" don ' t think of MY health . Elinor is well , you see . That must be enough for us both ."""
austen#"This remark was not calculated to make Edward or Elinor more easy , nor to conciliate the good will of Lucy , who looked up at Marianne with no very benignant expression . "" Do you like London ?"" said Edward , willing to say any thing that might introduce another subject . "" Not at all . I expected much pleasure in it , but I have found none . The sight of you , Edward , is the only comfort it has afforded ; and thank Heaven !"
austen#"you are what you always were !"" She paused -- no one spoke . "" I think , Elinor ,"" she presently added , "" we must employ Edward to take care of us in our return to Barton . In a week or two , I suppose , we shall be going ; and , I trust , Edward will not be very unwilling to accept the charge ."" Poor Edward muttered something , but what it was , nobody knew , not even himself . But Marianne , who saw his agitation , and could easily trace it to whatever cause best pleased herself , was perfectly satisfied , and soon talked of something else ."
austen#""" We spent such a day , Edward , in Harley Street yesterday ! So dull , so wretchedly dull !-- But I have much to say to you on that head , which cannot be said now ."" And with this admirable discretion did she defer the assurance of her finding their mutual relatives more disagreeable than ever , and of her being particularly disgusted with his mother , till they were more in private . "" But why were you not there , Edward ?-- Why did you not come ?"" "" I was engaged elsewhere ."" "" Engaged !"
austen#"But what was that , when such friends were to be met ?"" "" Perhaps , Miss Marianne ,"" cried Lucy , eager to take some revenge on her , "" you think young men never stand upon engagements , if they have no mind to keep them , little as well as great ."" Elinor was very angry , but Marianne seemed entirely insensible of the sting ; for she calmly replied , "" Not so , indeed ; for , seriously speaking , I am very sure that conscience only kept Edward from Harley Street . And I really believe he HAS the most delicate conscience in the world ; the most scrupulous in performing every engagement , however minute , and however it may make against his interest or pleasure . He is the most fearful of giving pain , of wounding expectation , and the most incapable of being selfish , of any body I ever saw ."
austen#"Edward , it is so , and I will say it . What ! are you never to hear yourself praised !-- Then you must be no friend of mine ; for those who will accept of my love and esteem , must submit to my open commendation ."" The nature of her commendation , in the present case , however , happened to be particularly ill - suited to the feelings of two thirds of her auditors , and was so very unexhilarating to Edward , that he very soon got up to go away . "" Going so soon !"" said Marianne ; "" my dear Edward , this must not be ."""
austen#"And drawing him a little aside , she whispered her persuasion that Lucy could not stay much longer . But even this encouragement failed , for he would go ; and Lucy , who would have outstaid him , had his visit lasted two hours , soon afterwards went away . "" What can bring her here so often ?"" said Marianne , on her leaving them . "" Could not she see that we wanted her gone !-- how teazing to Edward !"" "" Why so ?-- we were all his friends , and Lucy has been the longest known to him of any ."
austen#"It is but natural that he should like to see her as well as ourselves ."" Marianne looked at her steadily , and said , "" You know , Elinor , that this is a kind of talking which I cannot bear . If you only hope to have your assertion contradicted , as I must suppose to be the case , you ought to recollect that I am the last person in the world to do it . I cannot descend to be tricked out of assurances , that are not really wanted ."" She then left the room ; and Elinor dared not follow her to say more , for bound as she was by her promise of secrecy to Lucy , she could give no information that would convince Marianne ; and painful as the consequences of her still continuing in an error might be , she was obliged to submit to it . All that she could hope , was that Edward would not often expose her or himself to the distress of hearing Marianne ' s mistaken warmth , nor to the repetition of any other part of the pain that had attended their recent meeting -- and this she had every reason to expect ."
austen#CHAPTER 36 Within a few days after this meeting , the newspapers announced to the world , that the lady of Thomas Palmer , Esq . was safely delivered of a son and heir ; a very interesting and satisfactory paragraph , at least to all those intimate connections who knew it before . This event , highly important to Mrs . Jennings ' s happiness , produced a temporary alteration in the disposal of her time , and influenced , in a like degree , the engagements of her young friends ; for as she wished to be as much as possible with Charlotte , she went thither every morning as soon as she was dressed , and did not return till late in the evening ; and the Miss Dashwoods , at the particular request of the Middletons , spent the whole of every day , in every day in Conduit Street . For their own comfort they would much rather have remained , at least all the morning , in Mrs . Jennings ' s house ; but it was not a thing to be urged against the wishes of everybody . Their hours were therefore made over to Lady Middleton and the two Miss Steeles , by whom their company , in fact was as little valued , as it was professedly sought .
austen#They had too much sense to be desirable companions to the former ; and by the latter they were considered with a jealous eye , as intruding on THEIR ground , and sharing the kindness which they wanted to monopolize . Though nothing could be more polite than Lady Middleton ' s behaviour to Elinor and Marianne , she did not really like them at all . Because they neither flattered herself nor her children , she could not believe them good - natured ; and because they were fond of reading , she fancied them satirical : perhaps without exactly knowing what it was to be satirical ; but THAT did not signify . It was censure in common use , and easily given . Their presence was a restraint both on her and on Lucy . It checked the idleness of one , and the business of the other .
austen#Lady Middleton was ashamed of doing nothing before them , and the flattery which Lucy was proud to think of and administer at other times , she feared they would despise her for offering . Miss Steele was the least discomposed of the three , by their presence ; and it was in their power to reconcile her to it entirely . Would either of them only have given her a full and minute account of the whole affair between Marianne and Mr . Willoughby , she would have thought herself amply rewarded for the sacrifice of the best place by the fire after dinner , which their arrival occasioned . But this conciliation was not granted ; for though she often threw out expressions of pity for her sister to Elinor , and more than once dropt a reflection on the inconstancy of beaux before Marianne , no effect was produced , but a look of indifference from the former , or of disgust in the latter . An effort even yet lighter might have made her their friend . Would they only have laughed at her about the Doctor !
austen#But so little were they , anymore than the others , inclined to oblige her , that if Sir John dined from home , she might spend a whole day without hearing any other raillery on the subject , than what she was kind enough to bestow on herself . All these jealousies and discontents , however , were so totally unsuspected by Mrs . Jennings , that she thought it a delightful thing for the girls to be together ; and generally congratulated her young friends every night , on having escaped the company of a stupid old woman so long . She joined them sometimes at Sir John ' s , sometimes at her own house ; but wherever it was , she always came in excellent spirits , full of delight and importance , attributing Charlotte ' s well doing to her own care , and ready to give so exact , so minute a detail of her situation , as only Miss Steele had curiosity enough to desire . One thing DID disturb her ; and of that she made her daily complaint . Mr . Palmer maintained the common , but unfatherly opinion among his sex , of all infants being alike ; and though she could plainly perceive , at different times , the most striking resemblance between this baby and every one of his relations on both sides , there was no convincing his father of it ; no persuading him to believe that it was not exactly like every other baby of the same age ; nor could he even be brought to acknowledge the simple proposition of its being the finest child in the world . I come now to the relation of a misfortune , which about this time befell Mrs . John Dashwood .
austen#It so happened that while her two sisters with Mrs . Jennings were first calling on her in Harley Street , another of her acquaintance had dropt in -- a circumstance in itself not apparently likely to produce evil to her . But while the imaginations of other people will carry them away to form wrong judgments of our conduct , and to decide on it by slight appearances , one ' s happiness must in some measure be always at the mercy of chance . In the present instance , this last - arrived lady allowed her fancy to so far outrun truth and probability , that on merely hearing the name of the Miss Dashwoods , and understanding them to be Mr . Dashwood ' s sisters , she immediately concluded them to be staying in Harley Street ; and this misconstruction produced within a day or two afterwards , cards of invitation for them as well as for their brother and sister , to a small musical party at her house . The consequence of which was , that Mrs . John Dashwood was obliged to submit not only to the exceedingly great inconvenience of sending her carriage for the Miss Dashwoods , but , what was still worse , must be subject to all the unpleasantness of appearing to treat them with attention : and who could tell that they might not expect to go out with her a second time ? The power of disappointing them , it was true , must always be her ' s . But that was not enough ; for when people are determined on a mode of conduct which they know to be wrong , they feel injured by the expectation of any thing better from them .
austen#"Marianne had now been brought by degrees , so much into the habit of going out every day , that it was become a matter of indifference to her , whether she went or not : and she prepared quietly and mechanically for every evening ' s engagement , though without expecting the smallest amusement from any , and very often without knowing , till the last moment , where it was to take her . To her dress and appearance she was grown so perfectly indifferent , as not to bestow half the consideration on it , during the whole of her toilet , which it received from Miss Steele in the first five minutes of their being together , when it was finished . Nothing escaped HER minute observation and general curiosity ; she saw every thing , and asked every thing ; was never easy till she knew the price of every part of Marianne ' s dress ; could have guessed the number of her gowns altogether with better judgment than Marianne herself , and was not without hopes of finding out before they parted , how much her washing cost per week , and how much she had every year to spend upon herself . The impertinence of these kind of scrutinies , moreover , was generally concluded with a compliment , which though meant as its douceur , was considered by Marianne as the greatest impertinence of all ; for after undergoing an examination into the value and make of her gown , the colour of her shoes , and the arrangement of her hair , she was almost sure of being told that upon "" her word she looked vastly smart , and she dared to say she would make a great many conquests ."" With such encouragement as this , was she dismissed on the present occasion , to her brother ' s carriage ; which they were ready to enter five minutes after it stopped at the door , a punctuality not very agreeable to their sister - in - law , who had preceded them to the house of her acquaintance , and was there hoping for some delay on their part that might inconvenience either herself or her coachman . The events of this evening were not very remarkable ."
austen#The party , like other musical parties , comprehended a great many people who had real taste for the performance , and a great many more who had none at all ; and the performers themselves were , as usual , in their own estimation , and that of their immediate friends , the first private performers in England . As Elinor was neither musical , nor affecting to be so , she made no scruple of turning her eyes from the grand pianoforte , whenever it suited her , and unrestrained even by the presence of a harp , and violoncello , would fix them at pleasure on any other object in the room . In one of these excursive glances she perceived among a group of young men , the very he , who had given them a lecture on toothpick - cases at Gray ' s . She perceived him soon afterwards looking at herself , and speaking familiarly to her brother ; and had just determined to find out his name from the latter , when they both came towards her , and Mr . Dashwood introduced him to her as Mr . Robert Ferrars . He addressed her with easy civility , and twisted his head into a bow which assured her as plainly as words could have done , that he was exactly the coxcomb she had heard him described to be by Lucy . Happy had it been for her , if her regard for Edward had depended less on his own merit , than on the merit of his nearest relations !
austen#"For then his brother ' s bow must have given the finishing stroke to what the ill - humour of his mother and sister would have begun . But while she wondered at the difference of the two young men , she did not find that the emptiness of conceit of the one , put her out of all charity with the modesty and worth of the other . Why they WERE different , Robert exclaimed to her himself in the course of a quarter of an hour ' s conversation ; for , talking of his brother , and lamenting the extreme GAUCHERIE which he really believed kept him from mixing in proper society , he candidly and generously attributed it much less to any natural deficiency , than to the misfortune of a private education ; while he himself , though probably without any particular , any material superiority by nature , merely from the advantage of a public school , was as well fitted to mix in the world as any other man . "" Upon my soul ,"" he added , "" I believe it is nothing more ; and so I often tell my mother , when she is grieving about it . ' My dear Madam ,' I always say to her , ' you must make yourself easy . The evil is now irremediable , and it has been entirely your own doing ."
austen#"Why would you be persuaded by my uncle , Sir Robert , against your own judgment , to place Edward under private tuition , at the most critical time of his life ? If you had only sent him to Westminster as well as myself , instead of sending him to Mr . Pratt ' s , all this would have been prevented .' This is the way in which I always consider the matter , and my mother is perfectly convinced of her error ."" Elinor would not oppose his opinion , because , whatever might be her general estimation of the advantage of a public school , she could not think of Edward ' s abode in Mr . Pratt ' s family , with any satisfaction . "" You reside in Devonshire , I think ,""-- was his next observation , "" in a cottage near Dawlish ."" Elinor set him right as to its situation ; and it seemed rather surprising to him that anybody could live in Devonshire , without living near Dawlish ."
austen#"He bestowed his hearty approbation however on their species of house . "" For my own part ,"" said he , "" I am excessively fond of a cottage ; there is always so much comfort , so much elegance about them . And I protest , if I had any money to spare , I should buy a little land and build one myself , within a short distance of London , where I might drive myself down at any time , and collect a few friends about me , and be happy . I advise every body who is going to build , to build a cottage . My friend Lord Courtland came to me the other day on purpose to ask my advice , and laid before me three different plans of Bonomi ' s . I was to decide on the best of them ."
austen#"' My dear Courtland ,' said I , immediately throwing them all into the fire , ' do not adopt either of them , but by all means build a cottage .' And that I fancy , will be the end of it . "" Some people imagine that there can be no accommodations , no space in a cottage ; but this is all a mistake . I was last month at my friend Elliott ' s , near Dartford . Lady Elliott wished to give a dance . ' But how can it be done ?'"
austen#said she ; ' my dear Ferrars , do tell me how it is to be managed . There is not a room in this cottage that will hold ten couple , and where can the supper be ?' I immediately saw that there could be no difficulty in it , so I said , ' My dear Lady Elliott , do not be uneasy . The dining parlour will admit eighteen couple with ease ; card - tables may be placed in the drawing - room ; the library may be open for tea and other refreshments ; and let the supper be set out in the saloon .' Lady Elliott was delighted with the thought . We measured the dining - room , and found it would hold exactly eighteen couple , and the affair was arranged precisely after my plan .
austen#"So that , in fact , you see , if people do but know how to set about it , every comfort may be as well enjoyed in a cottage as in the most spacious dwelling ."" Elinor agreed to it all , for she did not think he deserved the compliment of rational opposition . As John Dashwood had no more pleasure in music than his eldest sister , his mind was equally at liberty to fix on any thing else ; and a thought struck him during the evening , which he communicated to his wife , for her approbation , when they got home . The consideration of Mrs . Dennison ' s mistake , in supposing his sisters their guests , had suggested the propriety of their being really invited to become such , while Mrs . Jenning ' s engagements kept her from home . The expense would be nothing , the inconvenience not more ; and it was altogether an attention which the delicacy of his conscience pointed out to be requisite to its complete enfranchisement from his promise to his father . Fanny was startled at the proposal ."
austen#""" I do not see how it can be done ,"" said she , "" without affronting Lady Middleton , for they spend every day with her ; otherwise I should be exceedingly glad to do it . You know I am always ready to pay them any attention in my power , as my taking them out this evening shews . But they are Lady Middleton ' s visitors . How can I ask them away from her ?"" Her husband , but with great humility , did not see the force of her objection . "" They had already spent a week in this manner in Conduit Street , and Lady Middleton could not be displeased at their giving the same number of days to such near relations ."""
austen#"Fanny paused a moment , and then , with fresh vigor , said , "" My love I would ask them with all my heart , if it was in my power . But I had just settled within myself to ask the Miss Steeles to spend a few days with us . They are very well behaved , good kind of girls ; and I think the attention is due to them , as their uncle did so very well by Edward . We can ask your sisters some other year , you know ; but the Miss Steeles may not be in town any more . I am sure you will like them ; indeed , you DO like them , you know , very much already , and so does my mother ; and they are such favourites with Harry !"""
austen#Mr . Dashwood was convinced . He saw the necessity of inviting the Miss Steeles immediately , and his conscience was pacified by the resolution of inviting his sisters another year ; at the same time , however , slyly suspecting that another year would make the invitation needless , by bringing Elinor to town as Colonel Brandon ' s wife , and Marianne as THEIR visitor . Fanny , rejoicing in her escape , and proud of the ready wit that had procured it , wrote the next morning to Lucy , to request her company and her sister ' s , for some days , in Harley Street , as soon as Lady Middleton could spare them . This was enough to make Lucy really and reasonably happy . Mrs . Dashwood seemed actually working for her , herself ; cherishing all her hopes , and promoting all her views ! Such an opportunity of being with Edward and his family was , above all things , the most material to her interest , and such an invitation the most gratifying to her feelings !
austen#It was an advantage that could not be too gratefully acknowledged , nor too speedily made use of ; and the visit to Lady Middleton , which had not before had any precise limits , was instantly discovered to have been always meant to end in two days ' time . When the note was shown to Elinor , as it was within ten minutes after its arrival , it gave her , for the first time , some share in the expectations of Lucy ; for such a mark of uncommon kindness , vouchsafed on so short an acquaintance , seemed to declare that the good - will towards her arose from something more than merely malice against herself ; and might be brought , by time and address , to do every thing that Lucy wished . Her flattery had already subdued the pride of Lady Middleton , and made an entry into the close heart of Mrs . John Dashwood ; and these were effects that laid open the probability of greater . The Miss Steeles removed to Harley Street , and all that reached Elinor of their influence there , strengthened her expectation of the event . Sir John , who called on them more than once , brought home such accounts of the favour they were in , as must be universally striking . Mrs . Dashwood had never been so much pleased with any young women in her life , as she was with them ; had given each of them a needle book made by some emigrant ; called Lucy by her Christian name ; and did not know whether she should ever be able to part with them .
austen#"[ At this point in the first and second edtions , Volume II ended .] CHAPTER 37 Mrs . Palmer was so well at the end of a fortnight , that her mother felt it no longer necessary to give up the whole of her time to her ; and , contenting herself with visiting her once or twice a day , returned from that period to her own home , and her own habits , in which she found the Miss Dashwoods very ready to resume their former share . About the third or fourth morning after their being thus resettled in Berkeley Street , Mrs . Jennings , on returning from her ordinary visit to Mrs . Palmer , entered the drawing - room , where Elinor was sitting by herself , with an air of such hurrying importance as prepared her to hear something wonderful ; and giving her time only to form that idea , began directly to justify it , by saying , "" Lord ! my dear Miss Dashwood !"
austen#"have you heard the news ?"" "" No , ma ' am . What is it ?"" "" Something so strange ! But you shall hear it all .-- When I got to Mr . Palmer ' s , I found Charlotte quite in a fuss about the child . She was sure it was very ill -- it cried , and fretted , and was all over pimples ."
austen#"So I looked at it directly , and , ' Lord ! my dear ,' says I , ' it is nothing in the world , but the red gum --' and nurse said just the same . But Charlotte , she would not be satisfied , so Mr . Donavan was sent for ; and luckily he happened to just come in from Harley Street , so he stepped over directly , and as soon as ever he saw the child , be said just as we did , that it was nothing in the world but the red gum , and then Charlotte was easy . And so , just as he was going away again , it came into my head , I am sure I do not know how I happened to think of it , but it came into my head to ask him if there was any news . So upon that , he smirked , and simpered , and looked grave , and seemed to know something or other , and at last he said in a whisper , ' For fear any unpleasant report should reach the young ladies under your care as to their sister ' s indisposition , I think it advisable to say , that I believe there is no great reason for alarm ; I hope Mrs . Dashwood will do very well .'"" "" What !"
austen#"is Fanny ill ?"" "" That is exactly what I said , my dear . ' Lord !' says I , ' is Mrs . Dashwood ill ?' So then it all came out ; and the long and the short of the matter , by all I can learn , seems to be this . Mr . Edward Ferrars , the very young man I used to joke with you about ( but however , as it turns out , I am monstrous glad there was never any thing in it ), Mr . Edward Ferrars , it seems , has been engaged above this twelvemonth to my cousin Lucy !-- There ' s for you , my dear !-- And not a creature knowing a syllable of the matter , except Nancy !-- Could you have believed such a thing possible ?-- There is no great wonder in their liking one another ; but that matters should be brought so forward between them , and nobody suspect it !-- THAT is strange !-- I never happened to see them together , or I am sure I should have found it out directly ."
austen#Well , and so this was kept a great secret , for fear of Mrs . Ferrars , and neither she nor your brother or sister suspected a word of the matter ;-- till this very morning , poor Nancy , who , you know , is a well - meaning creature , but no conjurer , popt it all out . ' Lord !' thinks she to herself , ' they are all so fond of Lucy , to be sure they will make no difficulty about it ;' and so , away she went to your sister , who was sitting all alone at her carpet - work , little suspecting what was to come -- for she had just been saying to your brother , only five minutes before , that she thought to make a match between Edward and some Lord ' s daughter or other , I forget who . So you may think what a blow it was to all her vanity and pride . She fell into violent hysterics immediately , with such screams as reached your brother ' s ears , as he was sitting in his own dressing - room down stairs , thinking about writing a letter to his steward in the country . So up he flew directly , and a terrible scene took place , for Lucy was come to them by that time , little dreaming what was going on .
austen#Poor soul ! I pity HER . And I must say , I think she was used very hardly ; for your sister scolded like any fury , and soon drove her into a fainting fit . Nancy , she fell upon her knees , and cried bitterly ; and your brother , he walked about the room , and said he did not know what to do . Mrs . Dashwood declared they should not stay a minute longer in the house , and your brother was forced to go down upon HIS knees too , to persuade her to let them stay till they had packed up their clothes . THEN she fell into hysterics again , and he was so frightened that he would send for Mr . Donavan , and Mr . Donavan found the house in all this uproar .
austen#The carriage was at the door ready to take my poor cousins away , and they were just stepping in as he came off ; poor Lucy in such a condition , he says , she could hardly walk ; and Nancy , she was almost as bad . I declare , I have no patience with your sister ; and I hope , with all my heart , it will be a match in spite of her . Lord ! what a taking poor Mr . Edward will be in when he hears of it ! To have his love used so scornfully ! for they say he is monstrous fond of her , as well he may .
austen#I should not wonder , if he was to be in the greatest passion !-- and Mr . Donavan thinks just the same . He and I had a great deal of talk about it ; and the best of all is , that he is gone back again to Harley Street , that he may be within call when Mrs . Ferrars is told of it , for she was sent for as soon as ever my cousins left the house , for your sister was sure SHE would be in hysterics too ; and so she may , for what I care . I have no pity for either of them . I have no notion of people ' s making such a to - do about money and greatness . There is no reason on earth why Mr . Edward and Lucy should not marry ; for I am sure Mrs . Ferrars may afford to do very well by her son , and though Lucy has next to nothing herself , she knows better than any body how to make the most of every thing ; I dare say , if Mrs . Ferrars would only allow him five hundred a - year , she would make as good an appearance with it as any body else would with eight . Lord !
austen#"how snug they might live in such another cottage as yours -- or a little bigger -- with two maids , and two men ; and I believe I could help them to a housemaid , for my Betty has a sister out of place , that would fit them exactly ."" Here Mrs . Jennings ceased , and as Elinor had had time enough to collect her thoughts , she was able to give such an answer , and make such observations , as the subject might naturally be supposed to produce . Happy to find that she was not suspected of any extraordinary interest in it ; that Mrs . Jennings ( as she had of late often hoped might be the case ) had ceased to imagine her at all attached to Edward ; and happy above all the rest , in the absence of Marianne , she felt very well able to speak of the affair without embarrassment , and to give her judgment , as she believed , with impartiality on the conduct of every one concerned in it . She could hardly determine what her own expectation of its event really was ; though she earnestly tried to drive away the notion of its being possible to end otherwise at last , than in the marriage of Edward and Lucy . What Mrs . Ferrars would say and do , though there could not be a doubt of its nature , she was anxious to hear ; and still more anxious to know how Edward would conduct himself . For HIM she felt much compassion ;-- for Lucy very little -- and it cost her some pains to procure that little ;-- for the rest of the party none at all ."
austen#As Mrs . Jennings could talk on no other subject , Elinor soon saw the necessity of preparing Marianne for its discussion . No time was to be lost in undeceiving her , in making her acquainted with the real truth , and in endeavouring to bring her to hear it talked of by others , without betraying that she felt any uneasiness for her sister , or any resentment against Edward . Elinor ' s office was a painful one .-- She was going to remove what she really believed to be her sister ' s chief consolation ,-- to give such particulars of Edward as she feared would ruin him for ever in her good opinion ,- and to make Marianne , by a resemblance in their situations , which to HER fancy would seem strong , feel all her own disappointment over again . But unwelcome as such a task must be , it was necessary to be done , and Elinor therefore hastened to perform it . She was very far from wishing to dwell on her own feelings , or to represent herself as suffering much , any otherwise than as the self - command she had practised since her first knowledge of Edward ' s engagement , might suggest a hint of what was practicable to Marianne . Her narration was clear and simple ; and though it could not be given without emotion , it was not accompanied by violent agitation , nor impetuous grief .-- THAT belonged rather to the hearer , for Marianne listened with horror , and cried excessively .
austen#Elinor was to be the comforter of others in her own distresses , no less than in theirs ; and all the comfort that could be given by assurances of her own composure of mind , and a very earnest vindication of Edward from every charge but of imprudence , was readily offered . But Marianne for some time would give credit to neither . Edward seemed a second Willoughby ; and acknowledging as Elinor did , that she HAD loved him most sincerely , could she feel less than herself ! As for Lucy Steele , she considered her so totally unamiable , so absolutely incapable of attaching a sensible man , that she could not be persuaded at first to believe , and afterwards to pardon , any former affection of Edward for her . She would not even admit it to have been natural ; and Elinor left her to be convinced that it was so , by that which only could convince her , a better knowledge of mankind . Her first communication had reached no farther than to state the fact of the engagement , and the length of time it had existed .-- Marianne ' s feelings had then broken in , and put an end to all regularity of detail ; and for some time all that could be done was to soothe her distress , lessen her alarms , and combat her resentment .
austen#"The first question on her side , which led to farther particulars , was , "" How long has this been known to you , Elinor ? has he written to you ?"" "" I have known it these four months . When Lucy first came to Barton Park last November , she told me in confidence of her engagement ."" At these words , Marianne ' s eyes expressed the astonishment which her lips could not utter ."
austen#"After a pause of wonder , she exclaimed -- "" Four months !-- Have you known of this four months ?"" Elinor confirmed it . "" What !-- while attending me in all my misery , has this been on your heart ?-- And I have reproached you for being happy !"" -- "" It was not fit that you should then know how much I was the reverse !"""
austen#""" Four months !"" -- cried Marianne again .--"" So calm !-- so cheerful !-- how have you been supported ?"" -- "" By feeling that I was doing my duty .-- My promise to Lucy , obliged me to be secret . I owed it to her , therefore , to avoid giving any hint of the truth ; and I owed it to my family and friends , not to create in them a solicitude about me , which it could not be in my power to satisfy ."" Marianne seemed much struck ."
austen#""" I have very often wished to undeceive yourself and my mother ,"" added Elinor ; "" and once or twice I have attempted it ;-- but without betraying my trust , I never could have convinced you ."" "" Four months !-- and yet you loved him !"" -- "" Yes . But I did not love only him ;-- and while the comfort of others was dear to me , I was glad to spare them from knowing how much I felt . Now , I can think and speak of it with little emotion ."
austen#"I would not have you suffer on my account ; for I assure you I no longer suffer materially myself . I have many things to support me . I am not conscious of having provoked the disappointment by any imprudence of my own , I have borne it as much as possible without spreading it farther . I acquit Edward of essential misconduct . I wish him very happy ; and I am so sure of his always doing his duty , that though now he may harbour some regret , in the end he must become so . Lucy does not want sense , and that is the foundation on which every thing good may be built .-- And after all , Marianne , after all that is bewitching in the idea of a single and constant attachment , and all that can be said of one ' s happiness depending entirely on any particular person , it is not meant -- it is not fit -- it is not possible that it should be so .-- Edward will marry Lucy ; he will marry a woman superior in person and understanding to half her sex ; and time and habit will teach him to forget that he ever thought another superior to HER ."""
austen#"-- "" If such is your way of thinking ,"" said Marianne , "" if the loss of what is most valued is so easily to be made up by something else , your resolution , your self - command , are , perhaps , a little less to be wondered at .-- They are brought more within my comprehension ."" "" I understand you .-- You do not suppose that I have ever felt much .-- For four months , Marianne , I have had all this hanging on my mind , without being at liberty to speak of it to a single creature ; knowing that it would make you and my mother most unhappy whenever it were explained to you , yet unable to prepare you for it in the least .-- It was told me ,-- it was in a manner forced on me by the very person herself , whose prior engagement ruined all my prospects ; and told me , as I thought , with triumph .-- This person ' s suspicions , therefore , I have had to oppose , by endeavouring to appear indifferent where I have been most deeply interested ;-- and it has not been only once ;-- I have had her hopes and exultation to listen to again and again .-- I have known myself to be divided from Edward for ever , without hearing one circumstance that could make me less desire the connection .-- Nothing has proved him unworthy ; nor has anything declared him indifferent to me .-- I have had to contend against the unkindness of his sister , and the insolence of his mother ; and have suffered the punishment of an attachment , without enjoying its advantages .-- And all this has been going on at a time , when , as you know too well , it has not been my only unhappiness .-- If you can think me capable of ever feeling -- surely you may suppose that I have suffered NOW . The composure of mind with which I have brought myself at present to consider the matter , the consolation that I have been willing to admit , have been the effect of constant and painful exertion ;-- they did not spring up of themselves ;-- they did not occur to relieve my spirits at first .-- No , Marianne .-- THEN , if I had not been bound to silence , perhaps nothing could have kept me entirely -- not even what I owed to my dearest friends -- from openly shewing that I was VERY unhappy ."" -- Marianne was quite subdued .--"
austen#""" Oh ! Elinor ,"" she cried , "" you have made me hate myself for ever .-- How barbarous have I been to you !-- you , who have been my only comfort , who have borne with me in all my misery , who have seemed to be only suffering for me !-- Is this my gratitude ?-- Is this the only return I can make you ?-- Because your merit cries out upon myself , I have been trying to do it away ."" The tenderest caresses followed this confession . In such a frame of mind as she was now in , Elinor had no difficulty in obtaining from her whatever promise she required ; and at her request , Marianne engaged never to speak of the affair to any one with the least appearance of bitterness ;-- to meet Lucy without betraying the smallest increase of dislike to her ;-- and even to see Edward himself , if chance should bring them together , without any diminution of her usual cordiality .-- These were great concessions ;-- but where Marianne felt that she had injured , no reparation could be too much for her to make . She performed her promise of being discreet , to admiration .-- She attended to all that Mrs . Jennings had to say upon the subject , with an unchanging complexion , dissented from her in nothing , and was heard three times to say , "" Yes , ma ' am ."" -- She listened to her praise of Lucy with only moving from one chair to another , and when Mrs . Jennings talked of Edward ' s affection , it cost her only a spasm in her throat .-- Such advances towards heroism in her sister , made Elinor feel equal to any thing herself ."
austen#"The next morning brought a farther trial of it , in a visit from their brother , who came with a most serious aspect to talk over the dreadful affair , and bring them news of his wife . "" You have heard , I suppose ,"" said he with great solemnity , as soon as he was seated , "" of the very shocking discovery that took place under our roof yesterday ."" They all looked their assent ; it seemed too awful a moment for speech . "" Your sister ,"" he continued , "" has suffered dreadfully . Mrs . Ferrars too -- in short it has been a scene of such complicated distress -- but I will hope that the storm may be weathered without our being any of us quite overcome . Poor Fanny !"
austen#she was in hysterics all yesterday . But I would not alarm you too much . Donavan says there is nothing materially to be apprehended ; her constitution is a good one , and her resolution equal to any thing . She has borne it all , with the fortitude of an angel ! She says she never shall think well of anybody again ; and one cannot wonder at it , after being so deceived !-- meeting with such ingratitude , where so much kindness had been shewn , so much confidence had been placed ! It was quite out of the benevolence of her heart , that she had asked these young women to her house ; merely because she thought they deserved some attention , were harmless , well - behaved girls , and would be pleasant companions ; for otherwise we both wished very much to have invited you and Marianne to be with us , while your kind friend there , was attending her daughter .
austen#"And now to be so rewarded ! ' I wish , with all my heart ,' says poor Fanny in her affectionate way , ' that we had asked your sisters instead of them .'"" Here he stopped to be thanked ; which being done , he went on . "" What poor Mrs . Ferrars suffered , when first Fanny broke it to her , is not to be described . While she with the truest affection had been planning a most eligible connection for him , was it to be supposed that he could be all the time secretly engaged to another person !-- such a suspicion could never have entered her head ! If she suspected ANY prepossession elsewhere , it could not be in THAT quarter ."
austen#' THERE , to be sure ,' said she , ' I might have thought myself safe .' She was quite in an agony . We consulted together , however , as to what should be done , and at last she determined to send for Edward . He came . But I am sorry to relate what ensued . All that Mrs . Ferrars could say to make him put an end to the engagement , assisted too as you may well suppose by my arguments , and Fanny ' s entreaties , was of no avail .
austen#"Duty , affection , every thing was disregarded . I never thought Edward so stubborn , so unfeeling before . His mother explained to him her liberal designs , in case of his marrying Miss Morton ; told him she would settle on him the Norfolk estate , which , clear of land - tax , brings in a good thousand a - year ; offered even , when matters grew desperate , to make it twelve hundred ; and in opposition to this , if he still persisted in this low connection , represented to him the certain penury that must attend the match . His own two thousand pounds she protested should be his all ; she would never see him again ; and so far would she be from affording him the smallest assistance , that if he were to enter into any profession with a view of better support , she would do all in her power to prevent him advancing in it ."" Here Marianne , in an ecstasy of indignation , clapped her hands together , and cried , "" Gracious God ! can this be possible !"""
austen#""" Well may you wonder , Marianne ,"" replied her brother , "" at the obstinacy which could resist such arguments as these . Your exclamation is very natural ."" Marianne was going to retort , but she remembered her promises , and forbore . "" All this , however ,"" he continued , "" was urged in vain . Edward said very little ; but what he did say , was in the most determined manner . Nothing should prevail on him to give up his engagement ."
austen#"He would stand to it , cost him what it might ."" "" Then ,"" cried Mrs . Jennings with blunt sincerity , no longer able to be silent , "" he has acted like an honest man ! I beg your pardon , Mr . Dashwood , but if he had done otherwise , I should have thought him a rascal . I have some little concern in the business , as well as yourself , for Lucy Steele is my cousin , and I believe there is not a better kind of girl in the world , nor one who more deserves a good husband ."" John Dashwood was greatly astonished ; but his nature was calm , not open to provocation , and he never wished to offend anybody , especially anybody of good fortune . He therefore replied , without any resentment ,"
austen#""" I would by no means speak disrespectfully of any relation of yours , madam . Miss Lucy Steele is , I dare say , a very deserving young woman , but in the present case you know , the connection must be impossible . And to have entered into a secret engagement with a young man under her uncle ' s care , the son of a woman especially of such very large fortune as Mrs . Ferrars , is perhaps , altogether a little extraordinary . In short , I do not mean to reflect upon the behaviour of any person whom you have a regard for , Mrs . Jennings . We all wish her extremely happy ; and Mrs . Ferrars ' s conduct throughout the whole , has been such as every conscientious , good mother , in like circumstances , would adopt . It has been dignified and liberal ."
austen#"Edward has drawn his own lot , and I fear it will be a bad one ."" Marianne sighed out her similar apprehension ; and Elinor ' s heart wrung for the feelings of Edward , while braving his mother ' s threats , for a woman who could not reward him . "" Well , sir ,"" said Mrs . Jennings , "" and how did it end ?"" "" I am sorry to say , ma ' am , in a most unhappy rupture :-- Edward is dismissed for ever from his mother ' s notice . He left her house yesterday , but where he is gone , or whether he is still in town , I do not know ; for WE of course can make no inquiry ."" "" Poor young man !-- and what is to become of him ?"""
austen#""" What , indeed , ma ' am ! It is a melancholy consideration . Born to the prospect of such affluence ! I cannot conceive a situation more deplorable . The interest of two thousand pounds -- how can a man live on it ?-- and when to that is added the recollection , that he might , but for his own folly , within three months have been in the receipt of two thousand , five hundred a - year ( for Miss Morton has thirty thousand pounds ,) I cannot picture to myself a more wretched condition . We must all feel for him ; and the more so , because it is totally out of our power to assist him ."""
austen#""" Poor young man !"" cried Mrs . Jennings , "" I am sure he should be very welcome to bed and board at my house ; and so I would tell him if I could see him . It is not fit that he should be living about at his own charge now , at lodgings and taverns ."" Elinor ' s heart thanked her for such kindness towards Edward , though she could not forbear smiling at the form of it . "" If he would only have done as well by himself ,"" said John Dashwood , "" as all his friends were disposed to do by him , he might now have been in his proper situation , and would have wanted for nothing . But as it is , it must be out of anybody ' s power to assist him ."
austen#"And there is one thing more preparing against him , which must be worse than all -- his mother has determined , with a very natural kind of spirit , to settle THAT estate upon Robert immediately , which might have been Edward ' s , on proper conditions . I left her this morning with her lawyer , talking over the business ."" "" Well !"" said Mrs . Jennings , "" that is HER revenge . Everybody has a way of their own . But I don ' t think mine would be , to make one son independent , because another had plagued me ."""
austen#"Marianne got up and walked about the room . "" Can anything be more galling to the spirit of a man ,"" continued John , "" than to see his younger brother in possession of an estate which might have been his own ? Poor Edward ! I feel for him sincerely ."" A few minutes more spent in the same kind of effusion , concluded his visit ; and with repeated assurances to his sisters that he really believed there was no material danger in Fanny ' s indisposition , and that they need not therefore be very uneasy about it , he went away ; leaving the three ladies unanimous in their sentiments on the present occasion , as far at least as it regarded Mrs . Ferrars ' s conduct , the Dashwoods ', and Edward ' s . Marianne ' s indignation burst forth as soon as he quitted the room ; and as her vehemence made reserve impossible in Elinor , and unnecessary in Mrs . Jennings , they all joined in a very spirited critique upon the party ."
austen#CHAPTER 38 Mrs . Jennings was very warm in her praise of Edward ' s conduct , but only Elinor and Marianne understood its true merit . THEY only knew how little he had had to tempt him to be disobedient , and how small was the consolation , beyond the consciousness of doing right , that could remain to him in the loss of friends and fortune . Elinor gloried in his integrity ; and Marianne forgave all his offences in compassion for his punishment . But though confidence between them was , by this public discovery , restored to its proper state , it was not a subject on which either of them were fond of dwelling when alone . Elinor avoided it upon principle , as tending to fix still more upon her thoughts , by the too warm , too positive assurances of Marianne , that belief of Edward ' s continued affection for herself which she rather wished to do away ; and Marianne ' s courage soon failed her , in trying to converse upon a topic which always left her more dissatisfied with herself than ever , by the comparison it necessarily produced between Elinor ' s conduct and her own .
austen#She felt all the force of that comparison ; but not as her sister had hoped , to urge her to exertion now ; she felt it with all the pain of continual self - reproach , regretted most bitterly that she had never exerted herself before ; but it brought only the torture of penitence , without the hope of amendment . Her mind was so much weakened that she still fancied present exertion impossible , and therefore it only dispirited her more . Nothing new was heard by them , for a day or two afterwards , of affairs in Harley Street , or Bartlett ' s Buildings . But though so much of the matter was known to them already , that Mrs . Jennings might have had enough to do in spreading that knowledge farther , without seeking after more , she had resolved from the first to pay a visit of comfort and inquiry to her cousins as soon as she could ; and nothing but the hindrance of more visitors than usual , had prevented her going to them within that time . The third day succeeding their knowledge of the particulars , was so fine , so beautiful a Sunday as to draw many to Kensington Gardens , though it was only the second week in March . Mrs . Jennings and Elinor were of the number ; but Marianne , who knew that the Willoughbys were again in town , and had a constant dread of meeting them , chose rather to stay at home , than venture into so public a place .
austen#"An intimate acquaintance of Mrs . Jennings joined them soon after they entered the Gardens , and Elinor was not sorry that by her continuing with them , and engaging all Mrs . Jennings ' s conversation , she was herself left to quiet reflection . She saw nothing of the Willoughbys , nothing of Edward , and for some time nothing of anybody who could by any chance whether grave or gay , be interesting to her . But at last she found herself with some surprise , accosted by Miss Steele , who , though looking rather shy , expressed great satisfaction in meeting them , and on receiving encouragement from the particular kindness of Mrs . Jennings , left her own party for a short time , to join their ' s . Mrs . Jennings immediately whispered to Elinor , "" Get it all out of her , my dear . She will tell you any thing if you ask ."
austen#"You see I cannot leave Mrs . Clarke ."" It was lucky , however , for Mrs . Jennings ' s curiosity and Elinor ' s too , that she would tell any thing WITHOUT being asked ; for nothing would otherwise have been learnt . "" I am so glad to meet you ;"" said Miss Steele , taking her familiarly by the arm --"" for I wanted to see you of all things in the world ."" And then lowering her voice , "" I suppose Mrs . Jennings has heard all about it . Is she angry ?"""
austen#""" Not at all , I believe , with you ."" "" That is a good thing . And Lady Middleton , is SHE angry ?"" "" I cannot suppose it possible that she should ."" "" I am monstrous glad of it . Good gracious !"
austen#I have had such a time of it ! I never saw Lucy in such a rage in my life . She vowed at first she would never trim me up a new bonnet , nor do any thing else for me again , so long as she lived ; but now she is quite come to , and we are as good friends as ever . Look , she made me this bow to my hat , and put in the feather last night . There now , YOU are going to laugh at me too . But why should not I wear pink ribbons ?
chesterton#[ The Ball and The Cross by G . K . Chesterton 1909 ] I . A DISCUSSION SOMEWHAT IN THE AIR The flying ship of Professor Lucifer sang through the skies like a silver arrow ; the bleak white steel of it , gleaming in the bleak blue emptiness of the evening . That it was far above the earth was no expression for it ; to the two men in it , it seemed to be far above the stars . The professor had himself invented the flying machine , and had also invented nearly everything in it .
chesterton#Every sort of tool or apparatus had , in consequence , to the full , that fantastic and distorted look which belongs to the miracles of science . For the world of science and evolution is far more nameless and elusive and like a dream than the world of poetry and religion ; since in the latter images and ideas remain themselves eternally , while it is the whole idea of evolution that identities melt into each other as they do in a nightmare . All the tools of Professor Lucifer were the ancient human tools gone mad , grown into unrecognizable shapes , forgetful of their origin , forgetful of their names . That thing which looked like an enormous key with three wheels was really a patent and very deadly revolver . That object which seemed to be created by the entanglement of two corkscrews was really the key . The thing which might have been mistaken for a tricycle turned upside - down was the inexpressibly important instrument to which the corkscrew was the key .
chesterton#All these things , as I say , the professor had invented ; he had invented everything in the flying ship , with the exception , perhaps , of himself . This he had been born too late actually to inaugurate , but he believed at least , that he had considerably improved it . There was , however , another man on board , so to speak , at the time . Him , also , by a curious coincidence , the professor had not invented , and him he had not even very greatly improved , though he had fished him up with a lasso out of his own back garden , in Western Bulgaria , with the pure object of improving him . He was an exceedingly holy man , almost entirely covered with white hair . You could see nothing but his eyes , and he seemed to talk with them .
chesterton#"A monk of immense learning and acute intellect he had made himself happy in a little stone hut and a little stony garden in the Balkans , chiefly by writing the most crushing refutations of exposures of certain heresies , the last professors of which had been burnt ( generally by each other ) precisely 1 , 119 years previously . They were really very plausible and thoughtful heresies , and it was really a creditable or even glorious circumstance , that the old monk had been intellectual enough to detect their fallacy ; the only misfortune was that nobody in the modern world was intellectual enough even to understand their argument . The old monk , one of whose names was Michael , and the other a name quite impossible to remember or repeat in our Western civilization , had , however , as I have said , made himself quite happy while he was in a mountain hermitage in the society of wild animals . And now that his luck had lifted him above all the mountains in the society of a wild physicist , he made himself happy still . "" I have no intention , my good Michael ,"" said Professor Lucifer , "" of endeavouring to convert you by argument . The imbecility of your traditions can be quite finally exhibited to anybody with mere ordinary knowledge of the world , the same kind of knowledge which teaches us not to sit in draughts or not to encourage friendliness in impecunious people ."
chesterton#"It is folly to talk of this or that demonstrating the rationalist philosophy . Everything demonstrates it . Rubbing shoulders with men of all kinds ----"" "" You will forgive me ,"" said the monk , meekly from under loads of white beard , "" but I fear I do not understand ; was it in order that I might rub my shoulder against men of all kinds that you put me inside this thing ?"" "" An entertaining retort , in the narrow and deductive manner of the Middle Ages ,"" replied the Professor , calmly , "" but even upon your own basis I will illustrate my point . We are up in the sky ."
chesterton#In your religion and all the religions , as far as I know ( and I know everything ), the sky is made the symbol of everything that is sacred and merciful . Well , now you are in the sky , you know better . Phrase it how you like , twist it how you like , you know that you know better . You know what are a man ' s real feelings about the heavens , when he finds himself alone in the heavens , surrounded by the heavens . You know the truth , and the truth is this . The heavens are evil , the sky is evil , the stars are evil .
chesterton#"This mere space , this mere quantity , terrifies a man more than tigers or the terrible plague . You know that since our science has spoken , the bottom has fallen out of the Universe . Now , heaven is the hopeless thing , more hopeless than any hell . Now , if there be any comfort for all your miserable progeny of morbid apes , it must be in the earth , underneath you , under the roots of the grass , in the place where hell was of old . The fiery crypts , the lurid cellars of the underworld , to which you once condemned the wicked , are hideous enough , but at least they are more homely than the heaven in which we ride . And the time will come when you will all hide in them , to escape the horror of the stars ."""
chesterton#""" I hope you will excuse my interrupting you ,"" said Michael , with a slight cough , "" but I have always noticed ----"" "" Go on , pray go on ,"" said Professor Lucifer , radiantly , "" I really like to draw out your simple ideas ."" "" Well , the fact is ,"" said the other , "" that much as I admire your rhetoric and the rhetoric of your school , from a purely verbal point of view , such little study of you and your school in human history as I have been enabled to make has led me to -- er -- rather singular conclusion , which I find great difficulty in expressing , especially in a foreign language ."" "" Come , come ,"" said the Professor , encouragingly , "" I ' ll help you out . How did my view strike you ?"" "" Well , the truth is , I know I don ' t express it properly , but somehow it seemed to me that you always convey ideas of that kind with most eloquence , when -- er -- when ----"""
chesterton#""" Oh ! get on ,"" cried Lucifer , boisterously . "" Well , in point of fact when your flying ship is just going to run into something . I thought you wouldn ' t mind my mentioning it , but it ' s running into something now ."" Lucifer exploded with an oath and leapt erect , leaning hard upon the handle that acted as a helm to the vessel . For the last ten minutes they had been shooting downwards into great cracks and caverns of cloud ."
chesterton#"Now , through a sort of purple haze , could be seen comparatively near to them what seemed to be the upper part of a huge , dark orb or sphere , islanded in a sea of cloud . The Professor ' s eyes were blazing like a maniac ' s . "" It is a new world ,"" he cried , with a dreadful mirth . "" It is a new planet and it shall bear my name . This star and not that other vulgar one shall be ' Lucifer , sun of the morning .' Here we will have no chartered lunacies , here we will have no gods ."
chesterton#"Here man shall be as innocent as the daisies , as innocent and as cruel -- here the intellect ----"" "" There seems ,"" said Michael , timidly , "" to be something sticking up in the middle of it ."" "" So there is ,"" said the Professor , leaning over the side of the ship , his spectacles shining with intellectual excitement . "" What can it be ? It might of course be merely a ----"" Then a shriek indescribable broke out of him of a sudden , and he flung up his arms like a lost spirit ."
chesterton#The monk took the helm in a tired way ; he did not seem much astonished for he came from an ignorant part of the world in which it is not uncommon for lost spirits to shriek when they see the curious shape which the Professor had just seen on the top of the mysterious ball , but he took the helm only just in time , and by driving it hard to the left he prevented the flying ship from smashing into St . Paul ' s Cathedral . A plain of sad - coloured cloud lay along the level of the top of the Cathedral dome , so that the ball and the cross looked like a buoy riding on a leaden sea . As the flying ship swept towards it , this plain of cloud looked as dry and definite and rocky as any grey desert . Hence it gave to the mind and body a sharp and unearthly sensation when the ship cut and sank into the cloud as into any common mist , a thing without resistance . There was , as it were , a deadly shock in the fact that there was no shock . It was as if they had cloven into ancient cliffs like so much butter .
chesterton#But sensations awaited them which were much stranger than those of sinking through the solid earth . For a moment their eyes and nostrils were stopped with darkness and opaque cloud ; then the darkness warmed into a kind of brown fog . And far , far below them the brown fog fell until it warmed into fire . Through the dense London atmosphere they could see below them the flaming London lights ; lights which lay beneath them in squares and oblongs of fire . The fog and fire were mixed in a passionate vapour ; you might say that the fog was drowning the flames ; or you might say that the flames had set the fog on fire . Beside the ship and beneath it ( for it swung just under the ball ), the immeasurable dome itself shot out and down into the dark like a combination of voiceless cataracts .
chesterton#Or it was like some cyclopean sea - beast sitting above London and letting down its tentacles bewilderingly on every side , a monstrosity in that starless heaven . For the clouds that belonged to London had closed over the heads of the voyagers sealing up the entrance of the upper air . They had broken through a roof and come into a temple of twilight . They were so near to the ball that Lucifer leaned his hand against it , holding the vessel away , as men push a boat off from a bank . Above it the cross already draped in the dark mists of the borderland was shadowy and more awful in shape and size . Professor Lucifer slapped his hand twice upon the surface of the great orb as if he were caressing some enormous animal .
chesterton#""" This is the fellow ,"" he said , "" this is the one for my money ."" "" May I with all respect inquire ,"" asked the old monk , "" what on earth you are talking about ?"" "" Why this ,"" cried Lucifer , smiting the ball again , "" here is the only symbol , my boy . So fat . So satisfied . Not like that scraggy individual , stretching his arms in stark weariness ."""
chesterton#"And he pointed up to the cross , his face dark with a grin . "" I was telling you just now , Michael , that I can prove the best part of the rationalist case and the Christian humbug from any symbol you liked to give me , from any instance I came across . Here is an instance with a vengeance . What could possibly express your philosophy and my philosophy better than the shape of that cross and the shape of this ball ? This globe is reasonable ; that cross is unreasonable . It is a four - legged animal , with one leg longer than the others ."
chesterton#The globe is inevitable . The cross is arbitrary . Above all the globe is at unity with itself ; the cross is primarily and above all things at enmity with itself . The cross is the conflict of two hostile lines , of irreconcilable direction . That silent thing up there is essentially a collision , a crash , a struggle in stone . Pah !
chesterton#"that sacred symbol of yours has actually given its name to a description of desperation and muddle . When we speak of men at once ignorant of each other and frustrated by each other , we say they are at cross - purposes . Away with the thing ! The very shape of it is a contradiction in terms ."" "" What you say is perfectly true ,"" said Michael , with serenity . "" But we like contradictions in terms ."
chesterton#Man is a contradiction in terms ; he is a beast whose superiority to other beasts consists in having fallen . That cross is , as you say , an eternal collision ; so am I . That is a struggle in stone . Every form of life is a struggle in flesh . The shape of the cross is irrational , just as the shape of the human animal is irrational . You say the cross is a quadruped with one limb longer than the rest .
chesterton#"I say man is a quadruped who only uses two of his legs ."" The Professor frowned thoughtfully for an instant , and said : "" Of course everything is relative , and I would not deny that the element of struggle and self - contradiction , represented by that cross , has a necessary place at a certain evolutionary stage . But surely the cross is the lower development and the sphere the higher . After all it is easy enough to see what is really wrong with Wren ' s architectural arrangement ."" "" And what is that , pray ?"" inquired Michael , meekly ."
chesterton#""" The cross is on top of the ball ,"" said Professor Lucifer , simply . "" That is surely wrong . The ball should be on top of the cross . The cross is a mere barbaric prop ; the ball is perfection . The cross at its best is but the bitter tree of man ' s history ; the ball is the rounded , the ripe and final fruit . And the fruit should be at the top of the tree , not at the bottom of it ."""
chesterton#""" Oh !"" said the monk , a wrinkle coming into his forehead , "" so you think that in a rationalistic scheme of symbolism the ball should be on top of the cross ?"" "" It sums up my whole allegory ,"" said the professor . "" Well , that is really very interesting ,"" resumed Michael slowly , "" because I think in that case you would see a most singular effect , an effect that has generally been achieved by all those able and powerful systems which rationalism , or the religion of the ball , has produced to lead or teach mankind . You would see , I think , that thing happen which is always the ultimate embodiment and logical outcome of your logical scheme ."" "" What are you talking about ?"""
chesterton#"asked Lucifer . "" What would happen ?"" "" I mean it would fall down ,"" said the monk , looking wistfully into the void . Lucifer made an angry movement and opened his mouth to speak , but Michael , with all his air of deliberation , was proceeding before he could bring out a word . "" I once knew a man like you , Lucifer ,"" he said , with a maddening monotony and slowness of articulation . "" He took this ----"""
chesterton#""" There is no man like me ,"" cried Lucifer , with a violence that shook the ship . "" As I was observing ,"" continued Michael , "" this man also took the view that the symbol of Christianity was a symbol of savagery and all unreason . His history is rather amusing . It is also a perfect allegory of what happens to rationalists like yourself . He began , of course , by refusing to allow a crucifix in his house , or round his wife ' s neck , or even in a picture . He said , as you say , that it was an arbitrary and fantastic shape , that it was a monstrosity , loved because it was paradoxical ."
chesterton#Then he began to grow fiercer and more eccentric ; he would batter the crosses by the roadside ; for he lived in a Roman Catholic country . Finally in a height of frenzy he climbed the steeple of the Parish Church and tore down the cross , waving it in the air , and uttering wild soliloquies up there under the stars . Then one still summer evening as he was wending his way homewards , along a lane , the devil of his madness came upon him with a violence and transfiguration which changes the world . He was standing smoking , for a moment , in the front of an interminable line of palings , when his eyes were opened . Not a light shifted , not a leaf stirred , but he saw as if by a sudden change in the eyesight that this paling was an army of innumerable crosses linked together over hill and dale . And he whirled up his heavy stick and went at it as if at an army .
chesterton#Mile after mile along his homeward path he broke it down and tore it up . For he hated the cross and every paling is a wall of crosses . When he returned to his house he was a literal madman . He sat upon a chair and then started up from it for the cross - bars of the carpentry repeated the intolerable image . He flung himself upon a bed only to remember that this , too , like all workmanlike things , was constructed on the accursed plan . He broke his furniture because it was made of crosses .
chesterton#"He burnt his house because it was made of crosses . He was found in the river ."" Lucifer was looking at him with a bitten lip . "" Is that story really true ?"" he asked . "" Oh , no ,"" said Michael , airily ."
chesterton#""" It is a parable . It is a parable of you and all your rationalists . You begin by breaking up the Cross ; but you end by breaking up the habitable world . We leave you saying that nobody ought to join the Church against his will . When we meet you again you are saying that no one has any will to join it with . We leave you saying that there is no such place as Eden ."
chesterton#"We find you saying that there is no such place as Ireland . You start by hating the irrational and you come to hate everything , for everything is irrational and so ----"" Lucifer leapt upon him with a cry like a wild beast ' s . "" Ah ,"" he screamed , "" to every man his madness . You are mad on the cross . Let it save you ."""
chesterton#"And with a herculean energy he forced the monk backwards out of the reeling car on to the upper part of the stone ball . Michael , with as abrupt an agility , caught one of the beams of the cross and saved himself from falling . At the same instant Lucifer drove down a lever and the ship shot up with him in it alone . "" Ha ! ha !"" he yelled , "" what sort of a support do you find it , old fellow ?"""
chesterton#""" For practical purposes of support ,"" replied Michael grimly , "" it is at any rate a great deal better than the ball . May I ask if you are going to leave me here ?"" "" Yes , yes . I mount ! I mount !"" cried the professor in ungovernable excitement ."
chesterton#""" _Altiora peto_ . My path is upward ."" "" How often have you told me , Professor , that there is really no up or down in space ?"" said the monk . "" I shall mount up as much as you will ."" "" Indeed ,"" said Lucifer , leering over the side of the flying ship ."
chesterton#""" May I ask what you are going to do ?"" The monk pointed downward at Ludgate Hill . "" I am going ,"" he said , "" to climb up into a star ."" Those who look at the matter most superficially regard paradox as something which belongs to jesting and light journalism . Paradox of this kind is to be found in the saying of the dandy , in the decadent comedy , "" Life is much too important to be taken seriously ."" Those who look at the matter a little more deeply or delicately see that paradox is a thing which especially belongs to all religions ."
chesterton#"Paradox of this kind is to be found in such a saying as "" The meek shall inherit the earth ."" But those who see and feel the fundamental fact of the matter know that paradox is a thing which belongs not to religion only , but to all vivid and violent practical crises of human living . This kind of paradox may be clearly perceived by anybody who happens to be hanging in mid - space , clinging to one arm of the Cross of St . Paul ' s . Father Michael in spite of his years , and in spite of his asceticism ( or because of it , for all I know ), was a very healthy and happy old gentleman . And as he swung on a bar above the sickening emptiness of air , he realized , with that sort of dead detachment which belongs to the brains of those in peril , the deathless and hopeless contradiction which is involved in the mere idea of courage . He was a happy and healthy old gentleman and therefore he was quite careless about it ."
chesterton#"And he felt as every man feels in the taut moment of such terror that his chief danger was terror itself ; his only possible strength would be a coolness amounting to carelessness , a carelessness amounting almost to a suicidal swagger . His one wild chance of coming out safely would be in not too desperately desiring to be safe . There might be footholds down that awful facade , if only he could not care whether they were footholds or no . If he were foolhardy he might escape ; if he were wise he would stop where he was till he dropped from the cross like a stone . And this antinomy kept on repeating itself in his mind , a contradiction as large and staring as the immense contradiction of the Cross ; he remembered having often heard the words , "" Whosoever shall lose his life the same shall save it ."" He remembered with a sort of strange pity that this had always been made to mean that whoever lost his physical life should save his spiritual life ."
chesterton#Now he knew the truth that is known to all fighters , and hunters , and climbers of cliffs . He knew that even his animal life could only be saved by a considerable readiness to lose it . Some will think it improbable that a human soul swinging desperately in mid - air should think about philosophical inconsistencies . But such extreme states are dangerous things to dogmatize about . Frequently they produce a certain useless and joyless activity of the mere intellect , thought not only divorced from hope but even from desire . And if it is impossible to dogmatize about such states , it is still more impossible to describe them .
chesterton#To this spasm of sanity and clarity in Michael ' s mind succeeded a spasm of the elemental terror ; the terror of the animal in us which regards the whole universe as its enemy ; which , when it is victorious , has no pity , and so , when it is defeated has no imaginable hope . Of that ten minutes of terror it is not possible to speak in human words . But then again in that damnable darkness there began to grow a strange dawn as of grey and pale silver . And of this ultimate resignation or certainty it is even less possible to write ; it is something stranger than hell itself ; it is perhaps the last of the secrets of God . At the highest crisis of some incurable anguish there will suddenly fall upon the man the stillness of an insane contentment . It is not hope , for hope is broken and romantic and concerned with the future ; this is complete and of the present .
chesterton#It is not faith , for faith by its very nature is fierce , and as it were at once doubtful and defiant ; but this is simply a satisfaction . It is not knowledge , for the intellect seems to have no particular part in it . Nor is it ( as the modern idiots would certainly say it is ) a mere numbness or negative paralysis of the powers of grief . It is not negative in the least ; it is as positive as good news . In some sense , indeed , it is good news . It seems almost as if there were some equality among things , some balance in all possible contingencies which we are not permitted to know lest we should learn indifference to good and evil , but which is sometimes shown to us for an instant as a last aid in our last agony .
chesterton#Michael certainly could not have given any sort of rational account of this vast unmeaning satisfaction which soaked through him and filled him to the brim . He felt with a sort of half - witted lucidity that the cross was there , and the ball was there , and the dome was there , that he was going to climb down from them , and that he did not mind in the least whether he was killed or not . This mysterious mood lasted long enough to start him on his dreadful descent and to force him to continue it . But six times before he reached the highest of the outer galleries terror had returned on him like a flying storm of darkness and thunder . By the time he had reached that place of safety he almost felt ( as in some impossible fit of drunkenness ) that he had two heads ; one was calm , careless , and efficient ; the other saw the danger like a deadly map , was wise , careful , and useless . He had fancied that he would have to let himself vertically down the face of the whole building .
chesterton#When he dropped into the upper gallery he still felt as far from the terrestrial globe as if he had only dropped from the sun to the moon . He paused a little , panting in the gallery under the ball , and idly kicked his heels , moving a few yards along it . And as he did so a thunderbolt struck his soul . A man , a heavy , ordinary man , with a composed indifferent face , and a prosaic sort of uniform , with a row of buttons , blocked his way . Michael had no mind to wonder whether this solid astonished man , with the brown moustache and the nickel buttons , had also come on a flying ship . He merely let his mind float in an endless felicity about the man .
chesterton#He thought how nice it would be if he had to live up in that gallery with that one man for ever . He thought how he would luxuriate in the nameless shades of this man ' s soul and then hear with an endless excitement about the nameless shades of the souls of all his aunts and uncles . A moment before he had been dying alone . Now he was living in the same world with a man ; an inexhaustible ecstasy . In the gallery below the ball Father Michael had found that man who is the noblest and most divine and most lovable of all men , better than all the saints , greater than all the heroes -- man Friday . In the confused colour and music of his new paradise , Michael heard only in a faint and distant fashion some remarks that this beautiful solid man seemed to be making to him ; remarks about something or other being after hours and against orders .
chesterton#"He also seemed to be asking how Michael "" got up "" there . This beautiful man evidently felt as Michael did that the earth was a star and was set in heaven . At length Michael sated himself with the mere sensual music of the voice of the man in buttons . He began to listen to what he said , and even to make some attempt at answering a question which appeared to have been put several times and was now put with some excess of emphasis . Michael realized that the image of God in nickel buttons was asking him how he had come there . He said that he had come in Lucifer ' s ship ."
chesterton#On his giving this answer the demeanour of the image of God underwent a remarkable change . From addressing Michael gruffly , as if he were a malefactor , he began suddenly to speak to him with a sort of eager and feverish amiability as if he were a child . He seemed particularly anxious to coax him away from the balustrade . He led him by the arm towards a door leading into the building itself , soothing him all the time . He gave what even Michael ( slight as was his knowledge of the world ) felt to be an improbable account of the sumptuous pleasures and varied advantages awaiting him downstairs . Michael followed him , however , if only out of politeness , down an apparently interminable spiral of staircase .
chesterton#At one point a door opened . Michael stepped through it , and the unaccountable man in buttons leapt after him and pinioned him where he stood . But he only wished to stand ; to stand and stare . He had stepped as it were into another infinity , out under the dome of another heaven . But this was a dome of heaven made by man . The gold and green and crimson of its sunset were not in the shapeless clouds but in shapes of cherubim and seraphim , awful human shapes with a passionate plumage .
chesterton#"Its stars were not above but far below , like fallen stars still in unbroken constellations ; the dome itself was full of darkness . And far below , lower even than the lights , could be seen creeping or motionless , great black masses of men . The tongue of a terrible organ seemed to shake the very air in the whole void ; and through it there came up to Michael the sound of a tongue more terrible ; the dreadful everlasting voice of man , calling to his gods from the beginning to the end of the world . Michael felt almost as if he were a god , and all the voices were hurled at him . "" No , the pretty things aren ' t here ,"" said the demi - god in buttons , caressingly . "" The pretty things are downstairs ."
chesterton#"You come along with me . There ' s something that will surprise you downstairs ; something you want very much to see ."" Evidently the man in buttons did not feel like a god , so Michael made no attempt to explain his feelings to him , but followed him meekly enough down the trail of the serpentine staircase . He had no notion where or at what level he was . He was still full of the cold splendour of space , and of what a French writer has brilliantly named the "" vertigo of the infinite ,"" when another door opened , and with a shock indescribable he found himself on the familiar level , in a street full of faces , with the houses and even the lamp - posts above his head . He felt suddenly happy and suddenly indescribably small ."
chesterton#He fancied he had been changed into a child again ; his eyes sought the pavement seriously as children ' s do , as if it were a thing with which something satisfactory could be done . He felt the full warmth of that pleasure from which the proud shut themselves out ; the pleasure which not only goes with humiliation , but which almost is humiliation . Men who have escaped death by a hair have it , and men whose love is returned by a woman unexpectedly , and men whose sins are forgiven them . Everything his eye fell on it feasted on , not aesthetically , but with a plain , jolly appetite as of a boy eating buns . He relished the squareness of the houses ; he liked their clean angles as if he had just cut them with a knife . The lit squares of the shop windows excited him as the young are excited by the lit stage of some promising pantomime .
chesterton#He happened to see in one shop which projected with a bulging bravery on to the pavement some square tins of potted meat , and it seemed like a hint of a hundred hilarious high teas in a hundred streets of the world . He was , perhaps , the happiest of all the children of men . For in that unendurable instant when he hung , half slipping , to the ball of St . Paul ' s , the whole universe had been destroyed and re - created . Suddenly through all the din of the dark streets came a crash of glass . With that mysterious suddenness of the Cockney mob , a rush was made in the right direction , a dingy office , next to the shop of the potted meat . The pane of glass was lying in splinters about the pavement .
chesterton#"And the police already had their hands on a very tall young man , with dark , lank hair and dark , dazed eyes , with a grey plaid over his shoulder , who had just smashed the shop window with a single blow of his stick . "" I ' d do it again ,"" said the young man , with a furious white face . "" Anybody would have done it . Did you see what it said ? I swear I ' d do it again ."" Then his eyes encountered the monkish habit of Michael , and he pulled off his grey tam - o '- shanter with the gesture of a Catholic ."
chesterton#""" Father , did you see what they said ?"" he cried , trembling . "" Did you see what they dared to say ? I didn ' t understand it at first . I read it half through before I broke the window ."" Michael felt he knew not how ."
chesterton#The whole peace of the world was pent up painfully in his heart . The new and childlike world which he had seen so suddenly , men had not seen at all . Here they were still at their old bewildering , pardonable , useless quarrels , with so much to be said on both sides , and so little that need be said at all . A fierce inspiration fell on him suddenly ; he would strike them where they stood with the love of God . They should not move till they saw their own sweet and startling existence . They should not go from that place till they went home embracing like brothers and shouting like men delivered .
chesterton#"From the Cross from which he had fallen fell the shadow of its fantastic mercy ; and the first three words he spoke in a voice like a silver trumpet , held men as still as stones . Perhaps if he had spoken there for an hour in his illumination he might have founded a religion on Ludgate Hill . But the heavy hand of his guide fell suddenly on his shoulder . "" This poor fellow is dotty ,"" he said good - humouredly to the crowd . "" I found him wandering in the Cathedral . Says he came in a flying ship ."
chesterton#"Is there a constable to spare to take care of him ?"" There was a constable to spare . Two other constables attended to the tall young man in grey ; a fourth concerned himself with the owner of the shop , who showed some tendency to be turbulent . They took the tall young man away to a magistrate , whither we shall follow him in an ensuing chapter . And they took the happiest man in the world away to an asylum . II ."
chesterton#"THE RELIGION OF THE STIPENDIARY MAGISTRATE The editorial office of _The Atheist_ had for some years past become less and less prominently interesting as a feature of Ludgate Hill . The paper was unsuited to the atmosphere . It showed an interest in the Bible unknown in the district , and a knowledge of that volume to which nobody else on Ludgate Hill could make any conspicuous claim . It was in vain that the editor of _The Atheist_ filled his front window with fierce and final demands as to what Noah in the Ark did with the neck of the giraffe . It was in vain that he asked violently , as for the last time , how the statement "" God is Spirit "" could be reconciled with the statement "" The earth is His footstool ."""
chesterton#It was in vain that he cried with an accusing energy that the Bishop of London was paid L12 , 000 a year for pretending to believe that the whale swallowed Jonah . It was in vain that he hung in conspicuous places the most thrilling scientific calculations about the width of the throat of a whale . Was it nothing to them all they that passed by ? Did his sudden and splendid and truly sincere indignation never stir any of the people pouring down Ludgate Hill ? Never . The little man who edited _The Atheist_ would rush from his shop on starlit evenings and shake his fist at St . Paul ' s in the passion of his holy war upon the holy place .
chesterton#He might have spared his emotion . The cross at the top of St . Paul ' s and _The Atheist_ shop at the foot of it were alike remote from the world . The shop and the Cross were equally uplifted and alone in the empty heavens . To the little man who edited _The Atheist_ , a fiery little Scotchman , with fiery , red hair and beard , going by the name of Turnbull , all this decline in public importance seemed not so much sad or even mad , but merely bewildering and unaccountable . He had said the worst thing that could be said ; and it seemed accepted and ignored like the ordinary second best of the politicians . Every day his blasphemies looked more glaring , and every day the dust lay thicker upon them .
chesterton#It made him feel as if he were moving in a world of idiots . He seemed among a race of men who smiled when told of their own death , or looked vacantly at the Day of Judgement . Year after year went by , and year after year the death of God in a shop in Ludgate became a less and less important occurrence . All the forward men of his age discouraged Turnbull . The socialists said he was cursing priests when he should be cursing capitalists . The artists said that the soul was most spiritual , not when freed from religion , but when freed from morality .
chesterton#Year after year went by , and at least a man came by who treated Mr . Turnbull ' s secularist shop with a real respect and seriousness . He was a young man in a grey plaid , and he smashed the window . He was a young man , born in the Bay of Arisaig , opposite Rum and the Isle of Skye . His high , hawklike features and snaky black hair bore the mark of that unknown historic thing which is crudely called Celtic , but which is probably far older than the Celts , whoever they were . He was in name and stock a Highlander of the Macdonalds ; but his family took , as was common in such cases , the name of a subordinate sept as a surname , and for all the purposes which could be answered in London , he called himself Evan MacIan . He had been brought up in some loneliness and seclusion as a strict Roman Catholic , in the midst of that little wedge of Roman Catholics which is driven into the Western Highlands .
chesterton#And he had found his way as far as Fleet Street , seeking some half - promised employment , without having properly realized that there were in the world any people who were not Roman Catholics . He had uncovered himself for a few moments before the statue of Queen Anne , in front of St . Paul ' s Cathedral , under the firm impression that it was a figure of the Virgin Mary . He was somewhat surprised at the lack of deference shown to the figure by the people bustling by . He did not understand that their one essential historical principle , the one law truly graven on their hearts , was the great and comforting statement that Queen Anne is dead . This faith was as fundamental as his faith , that Our Lady was alive . Any persons he had talked to since he had touched the fringe of our fashion or civilization had been by a coincidence , sympathetic or hypocritical .
chesterton#Or if they had spoken some established blasphemies , he had been unable to understand them merely owing to the preoccupied satisfaction of his mind . On that fantastic fringe of the Gaelic land where he walked as a boy , the cliffs were as fantastic as the clouds . Heaven seemed to humble itself and come closer to the earth . The common paths of his little village began to climb quite suddenly and seemed resolved to go to heaven . The sky seemed to fall down towards the hills ; the hills took hold upon the sky . In the sumptuous sunset of gold and purple and peacock green cloudlets and islets were the same .
chesterton#Evan lived like a man walking on a borderland , the borderland between this world and another . Like so many men and nations who grow up with nature and the common things , he understood the supernatural before he understood the natural . He had looked at dim angels standing knee - deep in the grass before he had looked at the grass . He knew that Our Lady ' s robes were blue before he knew the wild roses round her feet were red . The deeper his memory plunged into the dark house of childhood the nearer and nearer he came to the things that cannot be named . All through his life he thought of the daylight world as a sort of divine debris , the broken remainder of his first vision .
chesterton#The skies and mountains were the splendid off - scourings of another place . The stars were lost jewels of the Queen . Our Lady had gone and left the stars by accident . His private tradition was equally wild and unworldly . His great - grandfather had been cut down at Culloden , certain in his last instant that God would restore the King . His grandfather , then a boy of ten , had taken the terrible claymore from the hand of the dead and hung it up in his house , burnishing it and sharpening it for sixty years , to be ready for the next rebellion .
chesterton#His father , the youngest son and the last left alive , had refused to attend on Queen Victoria in Scotland . And Evan himself had been of one piece with his progenitors ; and was not dead with them , but alive in the twentieth century . He was not in the least the pathetic Jacobite of whom we read , left behind by a final advance of all things . He was , in his own fancy , a conspirator , fierce and up to date . In the long , dark afternoons of the Highland winter , he plotted and fumed in the dark . He drew plans of the capture of London on the desolate sand of Arisaig .
chesterton#"When he came up to capture London , it was not with an army of white cockades , but with a stick and a satchel . London overawed him a little , not because he thought it grand or even terrible , but because it bewildered him ; it was not the Golden City or even hell ; it was Limbo . He had one shock of sentiment , when he turned that wonderful corner of Fleet Street and saw St . Paul ' s sitting in the sky . "" Ah ,"" he said , after a long pause , "" that sort of thing was built under the Stuarts !"" Then with a sour grin he asked himself what was the corresponding monument of the Brunswicks and the Protestant Constitution . After some warning , he selected a sky - sign of some pill ."
chesterton#"Half an hour afterwards his emotions left him with an emptied mind on the same spot . And it was in a mood of mere idle investigation that he happened to come to a standstill opposite the office of _The Atheist_ . He did not see the word "" atheist "", or if he did , it is quite possible that he did not know the meaning of the word . Even as it was , the document would not have shocked even the innocent Highlander , but for the troublesome and quite unforeseen fact that the innocent Highlander read it stolidly to the end ; a thing unknown among the most enthusiastic subscribers to the paper , and calculated in any case to create a new situation . With a smart journalistic instinct characteristic of all his school , the editor of _The Atheist_ had put first in his paper and most prominently in his window an article called "" The Mesopotamian Mythology and its Effects on Syriac Folk Lore ."" Mr . Evan MacIan began to read this quite idly , as he would have read a public statement beginning with a young girl dying in Brighton and ending with Bile Beans ."
chesterton#He received the very considerable amount of information accumulated by the author with that tired clearness of the mind which children have on heavy summer afternoons -- that tired clearness which leads them to go on asking questions long after they have lost interest in the subject and are as bored as their nurse . The streets were full of people and empty of adventures . He might as well know about the gods of Mesopotamia as not ; so he flattened his long , lean face against the dim bleak pane of the window and read all there was to read about Mesopotamian gods . He read how the Mesopotamians had a god named Sho ( sometimes pronounced Ji ), and that he was described as being very powerful , a striking similarity to some expressions about Jahveh , who is also described as having power . Evan had never heard of Jahveh in his life , and imagining him to be some other Mesopotamian idol , read on with a dull curiosity . He learnt that the name Sho , under its third form of Psa , occurs in an early legend which describes how the deity , after the manner of Jupiter on so many occasions , seduced a Virgin and begat a hero .
chesterton#This hero , whose name is not essential to our existence , was , it was said , the chief hero and Saviour of the Mesopotamian ethical scheme . Then followed a paragraph giving other examples of such heroes and Saviours being born of some profligate intercourse between God and mortal . Then followed a paragraph -- but Evan did not understand it . He read it again and then again . Then he did understand it . The glass fell in ringing fragments on to the pavement , and Evan sprang over the barrier into the shop , brandishing his stick .
chesterton#""" What is this ?"" cried little Mr . Turnbull , starting up with hair aflame . "" How dare you break my window ?"" "" Because it was the quickest cut to you ,"" cried Evan , stamping . "" Stand up and fight , you crapulous coward . You dirty lunatic , stand up , will you ?"
chesterton#"Have you any weapons here ?"" "" Are you mad ?"" asked Turnbull , glaring . "" Are you ?"" cried Evan . "" Can you be anything else when you plaster your own house with that God - defying filth ?"
chesterton#"Stand up and fight , I say ."" A great light like dawn came into Mr . Turnbull ' s face . Behind his red hair and beard he turned deadly pale with pleasure . Here , after twenty lone years of useless toil , he had his reward . Someone was angry with the paper . He bounded to his feet like a boy ; he saw a new youth opening before him ."
chesterton#And as not unfrequently happens to middle - aged gentlemen when they see a new youth opening before them , he found himself in the presence of the police . The policemen , after some ponderous questionings , collared both the two enthusiasts . They were more respectful , however , to the young man who had smashed the window , than to the miscreant who had had his window smashed . There was an air of refined mystery about Evan MacIan , which did not exist in the irate little shopkeeper , an air of refined mystery which appealed to the policemen , for policemen , like most other English types , are at once snobs and poets . MacIan might possibly be a gentleman , they felt ; the editor manifestly was not . And the editor ' s fine rational republican appeals to his respect for law , and his ardour to be tried by his fellow citizens , seemed to the police quite as much gibberish as Evan ' s mysticism could have done .
chesterton#The police were not used to hearing principles , even the principles of their own existence . The police magistrate , before whom they were hurried and tried , was a Mr . Cumberland Vane , a cheerful , middle - aged gentleman , honourably celebrated for the lightness of his sentences and the lightness of his conversation . He occasionally worked himself up into a sort of theoretic rage about certain particular offenders , such as the men who took pokers to their wives , talked in a loose , sentimental way about the desirability of flogging them , and was hopelessly bewildered by the fact that the wives seemed even more angry with him than with their husbands . He was a tall , spruce man , with a twist of black moustache and incomparable morning dress . He looked like a gentleman , and yet , somehow , like a stage gentleman . He had often treated serious crimes against mere order or property with a humane flippancy .
chesterton#"Hence , about the mere breaking of an editor ' s window , he was almost uproarious . "" Come , Mr . MacIan , come ,"" he said , leaning back in his chair , "" do you generally enter you friends ' houses by walking through the glass ?"" ( Laughter .) "" He is not my friend ,"" said Evan , with the stolidity of a dull child . "" Not your friend , eh ?"" said the magistrate , sparkling ."
chesterton#""" Is he your brother - in - law ?"" ( Loud and prolonged laughter .) "" He is my enemy ,"" said Evan , simply ; "" he is the enemy of God ."" Mr . Vane shifted sharply in his seat , dropping the eye - glass out of his eye in a momentary and not unmanly embarrassment . "" You mustn ' t talk like that here ,"" he said , roughly , and in a kind of hurry , "" that has nothing to do with us ."" Evan opened his great , blue eyes ; "" God ,"" he began ."
chesterton#""" Be quiet ,"" said the magistrate , angrily , "" it is most undesirable that things of that sort should be spoken about -- a -- in public , and in an ordinary Court of Justice . Religion is -- a -- too personal a matter to be mentioned in such a place ."" "" Is it ?"" answered the Highlander , "" then what did those policemen swear by just now ?"" "" That is no parallel ,"" answered Vane , rather irritably ; "" of course there is a form of oath -- to be taken reverently -- reverently , and there ' s an end of it . But to talk in a public place about one ' s most sacred and private sentiments -- well , I call it bad taste ."
chesterton#"( Slight applause .) I call it irreverent . I call it irreverent , and I ' m not specially orthodox either ."" "" I see you are not ,"" said Evan , "" but I am ."" "" We are wondering from the point ,"" said the police magistrate , pulling himself together . "" May I ask why you smashed this worthy citizen ' s window ?"""
chesterton#"Evan turned a little pale at the mere memory , but he answered with the same cold and deadly literalism that he showed throughout . "" Because he blasphemed Our Lady ."" "" I tell you once and for all ,"" cried Mr . Cumberland Vane , rapping his knuckles angrily on the table , "" I tell you , once and for all , my man , that I will not have you turning on any religious rant or cant here . Don ' t imagine that it will impress me . The most religious people are not those who talk about it . ( Applause .)"
chesterton#"You answer the questions and do nothing else ."" "" I did nothing else ,"" said Evan , with a slight smile . "" Eh ,"" cried Vane , glaring through his eye - glass . "" You asked me why I broke his window ,"" said MacIan , with a face of wood . "" I answered , ' Because he blasphemed Our Lady .' I had no other reason ."
chesterton#"So I have no other answer ."" Vane continued to gaze at him with a sternness not habitual to him . "" You are not going the right way to work , Sir ,"" he said , with severity . "" You are not going the right way to work to -- a -- have your case treated with special consideration . If you had simply expressed regret for what you had done , I should have been strongly inclined to dismiss the matter as an outbreak of temper . Even now , if you say that you are sorry I shall only ----"""
chesterton#""" But I am not in the least sorry ,"" said Evan , "" I am very pleased ."" "" I really believe you are insane ,"" said the stipendiary , indignantly , for he had really been doing his best as a good - natured man , to compose the dispute . "" What conceivable right have you to break other people ' s windows because their opinions do not agree with yours ? This man only gave expression to his sincere belief ."" "" So did I ,"" said the Highlander . "" And who are you ?"""
chesterton#"exploded Vane . "" Are your views necessarily the right ones ? Are you necessarily in possession of the truth ?"" "" Yes ,"" said MacIan . The magistrate broke into a contemptuous laugh . "" Oh , you want a nurse to look after you ,"" he said ."
chesterton#""" You must pay L10 ."" Evan MacIan plunged his hands into his loose grey garment and drew out a queer looking leather purse . It contained exactly twelve sovereigns . He paid down the ten , coin by coin , in silence , and equally silently returned the remaining two to the receptacle . Then he said , "" May I say a word , your worship ?"" Cumberland Vane seemed half hypnotized with the silence and automatic movements of the stranger ; he made a movement with his head which might have been either "" yes "" or "" no ""."
chesterton#""" I only wished to say , your worship ,"" said MacIan , putting back the purse in his trouser pocket , "" that smashing that shop window was , I confess , a useless and rather irregular business . It may be excused , however , as a mere preliminary to further proceedings , a sort of preface . Wherever and whenever I meet that man ,"" and he pointed to the editor of _The Atheist_ , "" whether it be outside this door in ten minutes from now , or twenty years hence in some distant country , wherever and whenever I meet that man , I will fight him . Do not be afraid . I will not rush at him like a bully , or bear him down with any brute superiority . I will fight him like a gentleman ; I will fight him as our fathers fought ."
chesterton#He shall choose how , sword or pistol , horse or foot . But if he refuses , I will write his cowardice on every wall in the world . If he had said of my mother what he said of the Mother of God , there is not a club of clean men in Europe that would deny my right to call him out . If he had said it of my wife , you English would yourselves have pardoned me for beating him like a dog in the market place . Your worship , I have no mother ; I have no wife . I have only that which the poor have equally with the rich ; which the lonely have equally with the man of many friends .
chesterton#To me this whole strange world is homely , because in the heart of it there is a home ; to me this cruel world is kindly , because higher than the heavens there is something more human than humanity . If a man must not fight for this , may he fight for anything ? I would fight for my friend , but if I lost my friend , I should still be there . I would fight for my country , but if I lost my country , I should still exist . But if what that devil dreams were true , I should not be -- I should burst like a bubble and be gone . I could not live in that imbecile universe .
chesterton#"Shall I not fight for my own existence ?"" The magistrate recovered his voice and his presence of mind . The first part of the speech , the bombastic and brutally practical challenge , stunned him with surprise ; but the rest of Evan ' s remarks , branching off as they did into theoretic phrases , gave his vague and very English mind ( full of memories of the hedging and compromise in English public speaking ) an indistinct sensation of relief , as if the man , though mad , were not so dangerous as he had thought . He went into a sort of weary laughter . "" For Heaven ' s sake , man ,"" he said , "" don ' t talk so much . Let other people have a chance ( laughter )."
chesterton#"I trust all that you said about asking Mr . Turnbull to fight , may be regarded as rubbish . In case of accidents , however , I must bind you over to keep the peace ."" "" To keep the peace ,"" repeated Evan , "" with whom ?"" "" With Mr . Turnbull ,"" said Vane . "" Certainly not ,"" answered MacIan . "" What has he to do with peace ?"""
chesterton#""" Do you mean to say ,"" began the magistrate , "" that you refuse to ..."" The voice of Turnbull himself clove in for the first time . "" Might I suggest ,"" he said , "" That I , your worship , can settle to some extent this absurd matter myself . This rather wild gentleman promises that he will not attack me with any ordinary assault -- and if he does , you may be sure the police shall hear of it . But he says he will not . He says he will challenge me to a duel ; and I cannot say anything stronger about his mental state than to say that I think that it is highly probable that he will . ( Laughter .)"
chesterton#"But it takes two to make a duel , your worship ( renewed laughter ). I do not in the least mind being described on every wall in the world as the coward who would not fight a man in Fleet Street , about whether the Virgin Mary had a parallel in Mesopotamian mythology . No , your worship . You need not trouble to bind him over to keep the peace . I bind myself over to keep the peace , and you may rest quite satisfied that there will be no duel with me in it ."" Mr . Cumberland Vane rolled about , laughing in a sort of relief ."
chesterton#""" You ' re like a breath of April , sir ,"" he cried . "" You ' re ozone after that fellow . You ' re perfectly right . Perhaps I have taken the thing too seriously . I should love to see him sending you challenges and to see you smiling . Well , well ."""
chesterton#Evan went out of the Court of Justice free , but strangely shaken , like a sick man . Any punishment of suppression he would have felt as natural ; but the sudden juncture between the laughter of his judge and the laughter of the man he had wronged , made him feel suddenly small , or at least , defeated . It was really true that the whole modern world regarded his world as a bubble . No cruelty could have shown it , but their kindness showed it with a ghastly clearness . As he was brooding , he suddenly became conscious of a small , stern figure , fronting him in silence . Its eyes were grey and awful , and its beard red .
chesterton#"It was Turnbull . "" Well , sir ,"" said the editor of _The Atheist_ , "" where is the fight to be ? Name the field , sir ."" Evan stood thunderstruck . He stammered out something , he knew not what ; he only guessed it by the answer of the other . "" Do I want to fight ?"
chesterton#"Do I want to fight ?"" cried the furious Free - thinker . "" Why , you moonstruck scarecrow of superstition , do you think your dirty saints are the only people who can die ? Haven ' t you hung atheists , and burned them , and boiled them , and did they ever deny their faith ? Do you think we don ' t want to fight ? Night and day I have prayed -- I have longed -- for an atheist revolution -- I have longed to see your blood and ours on the streets ."
chesterton#"Let it be yours or mine ?"" "" But you said ..."" began MacIan . "" I know ,"" said Turnbull scornfully . "" And what did you say ? You damned fool , you said things that might have got us locked up for a year , and shadowed by the coppers for half a decade . If you wanted to fight , why did you tell that ass you wanted to ?"
chesterton#"I got you out , to fight if you want to . Now , fight if you dare ."" "" I swear to you , then ,"" said MacIan , after a pause . "" I swear to you that nothing shall come between us . I swear to you that nothing shall be in my heart or in my head till our swords clash together . I swear it by the God you have denied , by the Blessed Lady you have blasphemed ; I swear it by the seven swords in her heart ."
chesterton#"I swear it by the Holy Island where my fathers are , by the honour of my mother , by the secret of my people , and by the chalice of the Blood of God ."" The atheist drew up his head . "" And I ,"" he said , "" give my word ."" III . SOME OLD CURIOSITIES The evening sky , a dome of solid gold , unflaked even by a single sunset cloud , steeped the meanest sights of London in a strange and mellow light ."
chesterton#It made a little greasy street of St . Martin ' s Lane look as if it were paved with gold . It made the pawnbroker ' s half - way down it shine as if it were really that Mountain of Piety that the French poetic instinct has named it ; it made the mean pseudo - French bookshop , next but one to it , a shop packed with dreary indecency , show for a moment a kind of Parisian colour . And the shop that stood between the pawnshop and the shop of dreary indecency , showed with quite a blaze of old world beauty , for it was , by accident , a shop not unbeautiful in itself . The front window had a glimmer of bronze and blue steel , lit , as by a few stars , by the sparks of what were alleged to be jewels ; for it was in brief , a shop of bric - a - brac and old curiosities . A row of half - burnished seventeenth - century swords ran like an ornate railing along the front of the window ; behind was a darker glimmer of old oak and old armour ; and higher up hung the most extraordinary looking South Sea tools or utensils , whether designed for killing enemies or merely for cooking them , no mere white man could possibly conjecture . But the romance of the eye , which really on this rich evening , clung about the shop , had its main source in the accident of two doors standing open , the front door that opened on the street and a back door that opened on an odd green square of garden , that the sun turned to a square of gold .
chesterton#There is nothing more beautiful than thus to look as it were through the archway of a house ; as if the open sky were an interior chamber , and the sun a secret lamp of the place . I have suggested that the sunset light made everything lovely . To say that it made the keeper of the curiosity shop lovely would be a tribute to it perhaps too extreme . It would easily have made him beautiful if he had been merely squalid ; if he had been a Jew of the Fagin type . But he was a Jew of another and much less admirable type ; a Jew with a very well - sounding name . For though there are no hard tests for separating the tares and the wheat of any people , one rude but efficient guide is that the nice Jew is called Moses Solomon , and the nasty Jew is called Thornton Percy .
chesterton#The keeper of the curiosity shop was of the Thornton Percy branch of the chosen people ; he belonged to those Lost Ten Tribes whose industrious object is to lose themselves . He was a man still young , but already corpulent , with sleek dark hair , heavy handsome clothes , and a full , fat , permanent smile , which looked at the first glance kindly , and at the second cowardly . The name over his shop was Henry Gordon , but two Scotchmen who were in his shop that evening could come upon no trace of a Scotch accent . These two Scotchmen in this shop were careful purchasers , but free - handed payers . One of them who seemed to be the principal and the authority ( whom , indeed , Mr . Henry Gordon fancied he had seen somewhere before ), was a small , sturdy fellow , with fine grey eyes , a square red tie and a square red beard , that he carried aggressively forward as if he defied anyone to pull it . The other kept so much in the background in comparison that he looked almost ghostly in his grey cloak or plaid , a tall , sallow , silent young man .
chesterton#"The two Scotchmen were interested in seventeenth - century swords . They were fastidious about them . They had a whole armoury of these weapons brought out and rolled clattering about the counter , until they found two of precisely the same length . Presumably they desired the exact symmetry for some decorative trophy . Even then they felt the points , poised the swords for balance and bent them in a circle to see that they sprang straight again ; which , for decorative purposes , seems carrying realism rather far . "" These will do ,"" said the strange person with the red beard ."
chesterton#""" And perhaps I had better pay for them at once . And as you are the challenger , Mr . MacIan , perhaps you had better explain the situation ."" The tall Scotchman in grey took a step forward and spoke in a voice quite clear and bold , and yet somehow lifeless , like a man going through an ancient formality . "" The fact is , Mr . Gordon , we have to place our honour in your hands . Words have passed between Mr . Turnbull and myself on a grave and invaluable matter , which can only be atoned for by fighting . Unfortunately , as the police are in some sense pursuing us , we are hurried , and must fight now and without seconds ."
chesterton#"But if you will be so kind as to take us into your little garden and see far play , we shall feel how ----"" The shopman recovered himself from a stunning surprise and burst out : "" Gentlemen , are you drunk ? A duel ! A duel in my garden . Go home , gentlemen , go home ."
chesterton#"Why , what did you quarrel about ?"" "" We quarrelled ,"" said Evan , in the same dead voice , "" about religion ."" The fat shopkeeper rolled about in his chair with enjoyment . "" Well , this is a funny game ,"" he said . "" So you want to commit murder on behalf of religion . Well , well my religion is a little respect for humanity , and ----"""
chesterton#""" Excuse me ,"" cut in Turnbull , suddenly and fiercely , pointing towards the pawnbroker ' s next door . "" Don ' t you own that shop ?"" "" Why -- er -- yes ,"" said Gordon . "" And don ' t you own that shop ?"" repeated the secularist , pointing backward to the pornographic bookseller . "" What if I do ?"""
chesterton#""" Why , then ,"" cried Turnbull , with grating contempt . "" I will leave the religion of humanity confidently in your hands ; but I am sorry I troubled you about such a thing as honour . Look here , my man . I do believe in humanity . I do believe in liberty . My father died for it under the swords of the Yeomanry ."
chesterton#I am going to die for it , if need be , under that sword on your counter . But if there is one sight that makes me doubt it it is your foul fat face . It is hard to believe you were not meant to be ruled like a dog or killed like a cockroach . Don ' t try your slave ' s philosophy on me . We are going to fight , and we are going to fight in your garden , with your swords . Be still !
chesterton#"Raise your voice above a whisper , and I run you through the body ."" Turnbull put the bright point of the sword against the gay waistcoat of the dealer , who stood choking with rage and fear , and an astonishment so crushing as to be greater than either . "" MacIan ,"" said Turnbull , falling almost into the familiar tone of a business partner , "" MacIan , tie up this fellow and put a gag in his mouth . Be still , I say , or I kill you where you stand ."" The man was too frightened to scream , but he struggled wildly , while Evan MacIan , whose long , lean hands were unusually powerful , tightened some old curtain cords round him , strapped a rope gag in his mouth and rolled him on his back on the floor . "" There ' s nothing very strong here ,"" said Evan , looking about him ."
chesterton#""" I ' m afraid he ' ll work through that gag in half an hour or so ."" "" Yes ,"" said Turnbull , "" but one of us will be killed by that time ."" "" Well , let ' s hope so ,"" said the Highlander , glancing doubtfully at the squirming thing on the floor . "" And now ,"" said Turnbull , twirling his fiery moustache and fingering his sword , "" let us go into the garden . What an exquisite summer evening !"" MacIan said nothing , but lifting his sword from the counter went out into the sun ."
chesterton#"The brilliant light ran along the blades , filling the channels of them with white fire ; the combatants stuck their swords in the turf and took off their hats , coats , waistcoats , and boots . Evan said a short Latin prayer to himself , during which Turnbull made something of a parade of lighting a cigarette which he flung away the instant after , when he saw MacIan apparently standing ready . Yet MacIan was not exactly ready . He stood staring like a man stricken with a trance . "" What are you staring at ?"" asked Turnbull ."
chesterton#""" Do you see the bobbies ?"" "" I see Jerusalem ,"" said Evan , "" all covered with the shields and standards of the Saracens ."" "" Jerusalem !"" said Turnbull , laughing . "" Well , we ' ve taken the only inhabitant into captivity ."" And he picked up his sword and made it whistle like a boy ' s wand ."
chesterton#""" I beg your pardon ,"" said MacIan , dryly . "" Let us begin ."" MacIan made a military salute with his weapon , which Turnbull copied or parodied with an impatient contempt ; and in the stillness of the garden the swords came together with a clear sound like a bell . The instant the blades touched , each felt them tingle to their very points with a personal vitality , as if they were two naked nerves of steel . Evan had worn throughout an air of apathy , which might have been the stale apathy of one who wants nothing . But it was indeed the more dreadful apathy of one who wants something and will care for nothing else ."
chesterton#And this was seen suddenly ; for the instant Evan engaged he disengaged and lunged with an infernal violence . His opponent with a desperate promptitude parried and riposted ; the parry only just succeeded , the riposte failed . Something big and unbearable seemed to have broken finally out of Evan in that first murderous lunge , leaving him lighter and cooler and quicker upon his feet . He fell to again , fiercely still , but now with a fierce caution . The next moment Turnbull lunged ; MacIan seemed to catch the point and throw it away from him , and was thrusting back like a thunderbolt , when a sound paralysed him ; another sound beside their ringing weapons . Turnbull , perhaps from an equal astonishment , perhaps from chivalry , stopped also and forebore to send his sword through his exposed enemy .
chesterton#""" What ' s that ?"" asked Evan , hoarsely . A heavy scraping sound , as of a trunk being dragged along a littered floor , came from the dark shop behind them . "" The old Jew has broken one of his strings , and he ' s crawling about ,"" said Turnbull . "" Be quick ! We must finish before he gets his gag out ."""
chesterton#""" Yes , yes , quick ! On guard !"" cried the Highlander . The blades crossed again with the same sound like song , and the men went to work again with the same white and watchful faces . Evan , in his impatience , went back a little to his wildness . He made windmills , as the French duellists say , and though he was probably a shade the better fencer of the two , he found the other ' s point pass his face twice so close as almost to graze his cheek ."
chesterton#The second time he realized the actual possibility of defeat and pulled himself together under a shock of the sanity of anger . He narrowed , and , so to speak , tightened his operations : he fenced ( as the swordsman ' s boast goes ), in a wedding ring ; he turned Turnbull ' s thrusts with a maddening and almost mechanical click , like that of a machine . Whenever Turnbull ' s sword sought to go over that other mere white streak it seemed to be caught in a complex network of steel . He turned one thrust , turned another , turned another . Then suddenly he went forward at the lunge with his whole living weight . Turnbull leaped back , but Evan lunged and lunged and lunged again like a devilish piston rod or battering ram .
chesterton#"And high above all the sound of the struggle there broke into the silent evening a bellowing human voice , nasal , raucous , at the highest pitch of pain . "" Help ! Help ! Police ! Murder ! Murder !"""
chesterton#"The gag was broken ; and the tongue of terror was loose . "" Keep on !"" gasped Turnbull . "" One may be killed before they come ."" The voice of the screaming shopkeeper was loud enough to drown not only the noise of the swords but all other noises around it , but even through its rending din there seemed to be some other stir or scurry . And Evan , in the very act of thrusting at Turnbull , saw something in his eyes that made him drop his sword ."
chesterton#"The atheist , with his grey eyes at their widest and wildest , was staring straight over his shoulder at the little archway of shop that opened on the street beyond . And he saw the archway blocked and blackened with strange figures . "" We must bolt , MacIan ,"" he said abruptly . "" And there isn ' t a damned second to lose either . Do as I do ."" With a bound he was beside the little cluster of his clothes and boots that lay on the lawn ; he snatched them up , without waiting to put any of them on ; and tucking his sword under his other arm , went wildly at the wall at the bottom of the garden and swung himself over it ."
chesterton#Three seconds after he had alighted in his socks on the other side , MacIan alighted beside him , also in his socks and also carrying clothes and sword in a desperate bundle . They were in a by - street , very lean and lonely itself , but so close to a crowded thoroughfare that they could see the vague masses of vehicles going by , and could even see an individual hansom cab passing the corner at the instant . Turnbull put his fingers to his mouth like a gutter - snipe and whistled twice . Even as he did so he could hear the loud voices of the neighbours and the police coming down the garden . The hansom swung sharply and came tearing down the little lane at his call . When the cabman saw his fares , however , two wild - haired men in their shirts and socks with naked swords under their arms , he not unnaturally brought his readiness to a rigid stop and stared suspiciously .
chesterton#""" You talk to him a minute ,"" whispered Turnbull , and stepped back into the shadow of the wall . "" We want you ,"" said MacIan to the cabman , with a superb Scotch drawl of indifference and assurance , "" to drive us to St . Pancras Station -- verra quick ."" "" Very sorry , sir ,"" said the cabman , "" but I ' d like to know it was all right . Might I arst where you come from , sir ?"" A second after he spoke MacIan heard a heavy voice on the other side of the wall , saying : "" I suppose I ' d better get over and look for them . Give me a back ."""
chesterton#""" Cabby ,"" said MacIan , again assuming the most deliberate and lingering lowland Scotch intonation , "" if ye ' re really verra anxious to ken whar a ' come fra ', I ' ll tell ye as a verra great secret . A ' come from Scotland . And a ' m gaein ' to St . Pancras Station . Open the doors , cabby ."" The cabman stared , but laughed . The heavy voice behind the wall said : "" Now then , a better back this time , Mr ."
chesterton#"Price ."" And from the shadow of the wall Turnbull crept out . He had struggled wildly into his coat ( leaving his waistcoat on the pavement ), and he was with a fierce pale face climbing up the cab behind the cabman . MacIan had no glimmering notion of what he was up to , but an instinct of discipline , inherited from a hundred men of war , made him stick to his own part and trust the other man ' s . "" Open the doors , cabby ,"" he repeated , with something of the obstinate solemnity of a drunkard , "" open the doors . Did ye no hear me say St . Pancras Station ?"""
chesterton#"The top of a policeman ' s helmet appeared above the garden wall . The cabman did not see it , but he was still suspicious and began : "" Very sorry , sir , but ..."" and with that the catlike Turnbull tore him out of his seat and hurled him into the street below , where he lay suddenly stunned . "" Give me his hat ,"" said Turnbull in a silver voice , that the other obeyed like a bugle . "" And get inside with the swords ."" And just as the red and raging face of a policeman appeared above the wall , Turnbull struck the horse with a terrible cut of the whip and the two went whirling away like a boomerang ."
chesterton#"They had spun through seven streets and three or four squares before anything further happened . Then , in the neighbourhood of Maida Vale , the driver opened the trap and talked through it in a manner not wholly common in conversations through that aperture . "" Mr . MacIan ,"" he said shortly and civilly . "" Mr . Turnbull ,"" replied his motionless fare . "" Under circumstances such as those in which we were both recently placed there was no time for anything but very abrupt action . I trust therefore that you have no cause to complain of me if I have deferred until this moment a consultation with you on our present position or future action ."
chesterton#"Our present position , Mr . MacIan , I imagine that I am under no special necessity of describing . We have broken the law and we are fleeing from its officers . Our future action is a thing about which I myself entertain sufficiently strong views ; but I have no right to assume or to anticipate yours , though I may have formed a decided conception of your character and a decided notion of what they will probably be . Still , by every principle of intellectual justice , I am bound to ask you now and seriously whether you wish to continue our interrupted relations ."" MacIan leant his white and rather weary face back upon the cushions in order to speak up through the open door . "" Mr . Turnbull ,"" he said , "" I have nothing to add to what I have said before ."
chesterton#It is strongly borne in upon me that you and I , the sole occupants of this runaway cab , are at this moment the two most important people in London , possibly in Europe . I have been looking at all the streets as we went past , I have been looking at all the shops as we went past , I have been looking at all the churches as we went past . At first , I felt a little dazed with the vastness of it all . I could not understand what it all meant . But now I know exactly what it all means . It means us .
chesterton#"This whole civilization is only a dream . You and I are the realities ."" "" Religious symbolism ,"" said Mr . Turnbull , through the trap , "" does not , as you are probably aware , appeal ordinarily to thinkers of the school to which I belong . But in symbolism as you use it in this instance , I must , I think , concede a certain truth . We _must_ fight this thing out somewhere ; because , as you truly say , we have found each other ' s reality . We _must_ kill each other -- or convert each other ."
chesterton#I used to think all Christians were hypocrites , and I felt quite mildly towards them really . But I know you are sincere -- and my soul is mad against you . In the same way you used , I suppose , to think that all atheists thought atheism would leave them free for immorality -- and yet in your heart you tolerated them entirely . Now you _know_ that I am an honest man , and you are mad against me , as I am against you . Yes , that ' s it . You can ' t be angry with bad men .
chesterton#"But a good man in the wrong -- why one thirsts for his blood . Yes , you open for me a vista of thought ."" "" Don ' t run into anything ,"" said Evan , immovably . "" There ' s something in that view of yours , too ,"" said Turnbull , and shut down the trap . They sped on through shining streets that shot by them like arrows . Mr . Turnbull had evidently a great deal of unused practical talent which was unrolling itself in this ridiculous adventure ."
chesterton#They had got away with such stunning promptitude that the police chase had in all probability not even properly begun . But in case it had , the amateur cabman chose his dizzy course through London with a strange dexterity . He did not do what would have first occurred to any ordinary outsider desiring to destroy his tracks . He did not cut into by - ways or twist his way through mean streets . His amateur common sense told him that it was precisely the poor street , the side street , that would be likely to remember and report the passing of a hansom cab , like the passing of a royal procession . He kept chiefly to the great roads , so full of hansoms that a wilder pair than they might easily have passed in the press .
chesterton#"In one of the quieter streets Evan put on his boots . Towards the top of Albany Street the singular cabman again opened the trap . "" Mr . MacIan ,"" he said , "" I understand that we have now definitely settled that in the conventional language honour is not satisfied . Our action must at least go further than it has gone under recent interrupted conditions . That , I believe , is understood ."" "" Perfectly ,"" replied the other with his bootlace in his teeth ."
chesterton#""" Under those conditions ,"" continued Turnbull , his voice coming through the hole with a slight note of trepidation very unusual with him , "" I have a suggestion to make , if that can be called a suggestion , which has probably occurred to you as readily as to me . Until the actual event comes off we are practically in the position if not of comrades , at least of business partners . Until the event comes off , therefore I should suggest that quarrelling would be inconvenient and rather inartistic ; while the ordinary exchange of politeness between man and man would be not only elegant but uncommonly practical ."" "" You are perfectly right ,"" answered MacIan , with his melancholy voice , "" in saying that all this has occurred to me . All duellists should behave like gentlemen to each other . But we , by the queerness of our position , are something much more than either duellists or gentlemen ."
chesterton#"We are , in the oddest and most exact sense of the term , brothers -- in arms ."" "" Mr . MacIan ,"" replied Turnbull , calmly , "" no more need be said ."" And he closed the trap once more . They had reached Finchley Road before he opened it again . Then he said , "" Mr . MacIan , may I offer you a cigar . It will be a touch of realism ."""
chesterton#""" Thank you ,"" answered Evan . "" You are very kind ."" And he began to smoke in the cab . IV . A DISCUSSION AT DAWN The duellists had from their own point of view escaped or conquered the chief powers of the modern world ."
chesterton#They had satisfied the magistrate , they had tied the tradesman neck and heels , and they had left the police behind . As far as their own feelings went they had melted into a monstrous sea ; they were but the fare and driver of one of the million hansoms that fill London streets . But they had forgotten something ; they had forgotten journalism . They had forgotten that there exists in the modern world , perhaps for the first time in history , a class of people whose interest is not that things should happen well or happen badly , should happen successfully or happen unsuccessfully , should happen to the advantage of this party or the advantage of that part , but whose interest simply is that things should happen . It is the one great weakness of journalism as a picture of our modern existence , that it must be a picture made up entirely of exceptions . We announce on flaring posters that a man has fallen off a scaffolding .
chesterton#"We do not announce on flaring posters that a man has not fallen off a scaffolding . Yet this latter fact is fundamentally more exciting , as indicating that that moving tower of terror and mystery , a man , is still abroad upon the earth . That the man has not fallen off a scaffolding is really more sensational ; and it is also some thousand times more common . But journalism cannot reasonably be expected thus to insist upon the permanent miracles . Busy editors cannot be expected to put on their posters , "" Mr . Wilkinson Still Safe ,"" or "" Mr . Jones , of Worthing , Not Dead Yet ."" They cannot announce the happiness of mankind at all ."
chesterton#"They cannot describe all the forks that are not stolen , or all the marriages that are not judiciously dissolved . Hence the complete picture they give of life is of necessity fallacious ; they can only represent what is unusual . However democratic they may be , they are only concerned with the minority . The incident of the religious fanatic who broke a window on Ludgate Hill was alone enough to set them up in good copy for the night . But when the same man was brought before a magistrate and defied his enemy to mortal combat in the open court , then the columns would hardly hold the excruciating information , and the headlines were so large that there was hardly room for any of the text . The _Daily Telegraph_ headed a column , "" A Duel on Divinity ,"" and there was a correspondence afterwards which lasted for months , about whether police magistrates ought to mention religion ."
chesterton#"The _Daily Mail_ in its dull , sensible way , headed the events , "" Wanted to fight for the Virgin ."" Mr . James Douglas , in _The Star_ , presuming on his knowledge of philosophical and theological terms , described the Christian ' s outbreak under the title of "" Dualist and Duellist ."" The _Daily News_ inserted a colourless account of the matter , but was pursued and eaten up for some weeks , with letters from outlying ministers , headed "" Murder and Mariolatry ."" But the journalistic temperature was steadily and consistently heated by all these influences ; the journalists had tasted blood , prospectively , and were in the mood for more ; everything in the matter prepared them for further outbursts of moral indignation . And when a gasping reporter rushed in in the last hours of the evening with the announcement that the two heroes of the Police Court had literally been found fighting in a London back garden , with a shopkeeper bound and gagged in the front of the house , the editors and sub - editors were stricken still as men are by great beatitudes . The next morning , five or six of the great London dailies burst out simultaneously into great blossoms of eloquent leader - writing ."
chesterton#"Towards the end all the leaders tended to be the same , but they all began differently . The _Daily Telegraph_ , for instance began , "" There will be little difference among our readers or among all truly English and law - abiding men touching the , etc . etc ."" The _Daily Mail_ said , "" People must learn , in the modern world , to keep their theological differences to themselves . The fracas , etc . etc ."""
chesterton#"The _Daily News_ started , "" Nothing could be more inimical to the cause of true religion than , etc . etc ."" The _Times_ began with something about Celtic disturbances of the equilibrium of Empire , and the _Daily Express_ distinguished itself splendidly by omitting altogether so controversial a matter and substituting a leader about goloshes . And the morning after that , the editors and the newspapers were in such a state , that , as the phrase is , there was no holding them . Whatever secret and elvish thing it is that broods over editors and suddenly turns their brains , that thing had seized on the story of the broken glass and the duel in the garden . It became monstrous and omnipresent , as do in our time the unimportant doings of the sect of the Agapemonites , or as did at an earlier time the dreary dishonesties of the Rhodesian financiers ."
chesterton#Questions were asked about it , and even answered , in the House of Commons . The Government was solemnly denounced in the papers for not having done something , nobody knew what , to prevent the window being broken . An enormous subscription was started to reimburse Mr . Gordon , the man who had been gagged in the shop . Mr . MacIan , one of the combatants , became for some mysterious reason , singly and hugely popular as a comic figure in the comic papers and on the stage of the music hall . He was always represented ( in defiance of fact ), with red whiskers , and a very red nose , and in full Highland costume . And a song , consisting of an unimaginable number of verses , in which his name was rhymed with flat iron , the British Lion , sly ' un , dandelion , Spion ( With Kop in the next line ), was sung to crowded houses every night .
chesterton#"The papers developed a devouring thirst for the capture of the fugitives ; and when they had not been caught for forty - eight hours , they suddenly turned the whole matter into a detective mystery . Letters under the heading , "" Where are They ,"" poured in to every paper , with every conceivable kind of explanation , running them to earth in the Monument , the Twopenny Tube , Epping Forest , Westminster Abbey , rolled up in carpets at Shoolbreds , locked up in safes in Chancery Lane . Yes , the papers were very interesting , and Mr . Turnbull unrolled a whole bundle of them for the amusement of Mr . MacIan as they sat on a high common to the north of London , in the coming of the white dawn . The darkness in the east had been broken with a bar of grey ; the bar of grey was split with a sword of silver and morning lifted itself laboriously over London . From the spot where Turnbull and MacIan were sitting on one of the barren steeps behind Hampstead , they could see the whole of London shaping itself vaguely and largely in the grey and growing light , until the white sun stood over it and it lay at their feet , the splendid monstrosity that it is . Its bewildering squares and parallelograms were compact and perfect as a Chinese puzzle ; an enormous hieroglyphic which man must decipher or die ."
chesterton#There fell upon both of them , but upon Turnbull more than the other , because he know more what the scene signified , that quite indescribable sense as of a sublime and passionate and heart - moving futility , which is never evoked by deserts or dead men or men neglected and barbarous , which can only be invoked by the sight of the enormous genius of man applied to anything other than the best . Turnbull , the old idealistic democrat , had so often reviled the democracy and reviled them justly for their supineness , their snobbishness , their evil reverence for idle things . He was right enough ; for our democracy has only one great fault ; it is not democratic . And after denouncing so justly average modern men for so many years as sophists and as slaves , he looked down from an empty slope in Hampstead and saw what gods they are . Their achievement seemed all the more heroic and divine , because it seemed doubtful whether it was worth doing at all . There seemed to be something greater than mere accuracy in making such a mistake as London .
chesterton#"And what was to be the end of it all ? what was to be the ultimate transformation of this common and incredible London man , this workman on a tram in Battersea , his clerk on an omnibus in Cheapside ? Turnbull , as he stared drearily , murmured to himself the words of the old atheistic and revolutionary Swinburne who had intoxicated his youth : "" And still we ask if God or man Can loosen thee Lazarus ; Bid thee rise up republican , And save thyself and all of us . But no disciple ' s tongue can say If thou can ' st take our sins away ."" Turnbull shivered slightly as if behind the earthly morning he felt the evening of the world , the sunset of so many hopes ."
chesterton#"Those words were from "" Songs before Sunrise "". But Turnbull ' s songs at their best were songs after sunrise , and sunrise had been no such great thing after all . Turnbull shivered again in the sharp morning air . MacIan was also gazing with his face towards the city , but there was that about his blind and mystical stare that told one , so to speak , that his eyes were turned inwards . When Turnbull said something to him about London , they seemed to move as at a summons and come out like two householders coming out into their doorways . "" Yes ,"" he said , with a sort of stupidity ."
chesterton#""" It ' s a very big place ."" There was a somewhat unmeaning silence , and then MacIan said again : "" It ' s a very big place . When I first came into it I was frightened of it . Frightened exactly as one would be frightened at the sight of a man forty feet high . I am used to big things where I come from , big mountains that seem to fill God ' s infinity , and the big sea that goes to the end of the world ."
chesterton#"But then these things are all shapeless and confused things , not made in any familiar form . But to see the plain , square , human things as large as that , houses so large and streets so large , and the town itself so large , was like having screwed some devil ' s magnifying glass into one ' s eye . It was like seeing a porridge bowl as big as a house , or a mouse - trap made to catch elephants ."" "" Like the land of the Brobdingnagians ,"" said Turnbull , smiling . "" Oh ! Where is that ?"""
chesterton#"said MacIan . Turnbull said bitterly , "" In a book ,"" and the silence fell suddenly between them again . They were sitting in a sort of litter on the hillside ; all the things they had hurriedly collected , in various places , for their flight , were strewn indiscriminately round them . The two swords with which they had lately sought each other ' s lives were flung down on the grass at random , like two idle walking - sticks . Some provisions they had bought last night , at a low public house , in case of undefined contingencies , were tossed about like the materials of an ordinary picnic , here a basket of chocolate , and there a bottle of wine . And to add to the disorder finally , there were strewn on top of everything , the most disorderly of modern things , newspapers , and more newspapers , and yet again newspapers , the ministers of the modern anarchy ."
chesterton#"Turnbull picked up one of them drearily , and took out a pipe . "" There ' s a lot about us ,"" he said . "" Do you mind if I light up ?"" "" Why should I mind ?"" asked MacIan . Turnbull eyed with a certain studious interest , the man who did not understand any of the verbal courtesies ; he lit his pipe and blew great clouds out of it ."
chesterton#""" Yes ,"" he resumed . "" The matter on which you and I are engaged is at this moment really the best copy in England . I am a journalist , and I know . For the first time , perhaps , for many generations , the English are really more angry about a wrong thing done in England than they are about a wrong thing done in France ."" "" It is not a wrong thing ,"" said MacIan . Turnbull laughed ."
chesterton#""" You seem unable to understand the ordinary use of the human language . If I did not suspect that you were a genius , I should certainly know you were a blockhead . I fancy we had better be getting along and collecting our baggage ."" And he jumped up and began shoving the luggage into his pockets , or strapping it on to his back . As he thrust a tin of canned meat , anyhow , into his bursting side pocket , he said casually : "" I only meant that you and I are the most prominent people in the English papers ."""
chesterton#""" Well , what did you expect ?"" asked MacIan , opening his great grave blue eyes . "" The papers are full of us ,"" said Turnbull , stooping to pick up one of the swords . MacIan stooped and picked up the other . "" Yes ,"" he said , in his simple way . "" I have read what they have to say ."
chesterton#"But they don ' t seem to understand the point ."" "" The point of what ?"" asked Turnbull . "" The point of the sword ,"" said MacIan , violently , and planted the steel point in the soil like a man planting a tree . "" That is a point ,"" said Turnbull , grimly , "" that we will discuss later . Come along ."""
chesterton#"Turnbull tied the last tin of biscuits desperately to himself with string ; and then spoke , like a diver girt for plunging , short and sharp . "" Now , Mr . MacIan , you must listen to me . You must listen to me , not merely because I know the country , which you might learn by looking at a map , but because I know the people of the country , whom you could not know by living here thirty years . That infernal city down there is awake ; and it is awake against us . All those endless rows of windows and windows are all eyes staring at us . All those forests of chimneys are fingers pointing at us , as we stand here on the hillside ."
chesterton#This thing has caught on . For the next six mortal months they will think of nothing but us , as for six mortal months they thought of nothing but the Dreyfus case . Oh , I know it ' s funny . They let starving children , who don ' t want to die , drop by the score without looking round . But because two gentlemen , from private feelings of delicacy , do want to die , they will mobilize the army and navy to prevent them . For half a year or more , you and I , Mr . MacIan , will be an obstacle to every reform in the British Empire .
chesterton#We shall prevent the Chinese being sent out of the Transvaal and the blocks being stopped in the Strand . We shall be the conversational substitute when anyone recommends Home Rule , or complains of sky signs . Therefore , do not imagine , in your innocence , that we have only to melt away among those English hills as a Highland cateran might into your god - forsaken Highland mountains . We must be eternally on our guard ; we must live the hunted life of two distinguished criminals . We must expect to be recognized as much as if we were Napoleon escaping from Elba . We must be prepared for our descriptions being sent to every tiny village , and for our faces being recognized by every ambitious policeman .
chesterton#"We must often sleep under the stars as if we were in Africa . Last and most important we must not dream of effecting our -- our final settlement , which will be a thing as famous as the Phoenix Park murders , unless we have made real and precise arrangements for our isolation -- I will not say our safety . We must not , in short , fight until we have thrown them off our scent , if only for a moment . For , take my word for it , Mr . MacIan , if the British Public once catches us up , the British Public will prevent the duel , if it is only by locking us both up in asylums for the rest of our days ."" MacIan was looking at the horizon with a rather misty look . "" I am not at all surprised ,"" he said , "" at the world being against us ."
chesterton#"It makes me feel I was right to ----"" "" Yes ?"" said Turnbull . "" To smash your window ,"" said MacIan . "" I have woken up the world ."" "" Very well , then ,"" said Turnbull , stolidly ."
chesterton#""" Let us look at a few final facts . Beyond that hill there is comparatively clear country . Fortunately , I know the part well , and if you will follow me exactly , and , when necessary , on your stomach , we may be able to get ten miles out of London , literally without meeting anyone at all , which will be the best possible beginning , at any rate . We have provisions for at least two days and two nights , three days if we do it carefully . We may be able to get fifty or sixty miles away without even walking into an inn door . I have the biscuits and the tinned meat , and the milk ."
chesterton#"You have the chocolate , I think ? And the brandy ?"" "" Yes ,"" said MacIan , like a soldier taking orders . "" Very well , then , come on . March . We turn under that third bush and so down into the valley ."""
chesterton#"And he set off ahead at a swinging walk . Then he stopped suddenly ; for he realized that the other was not following . Evan MacIan was leaning on his sword with a lowering face , like a man suddenly smitten still with doubt . "" What on earth is the matter ?"" asked Turnbull , staring in some anger . Evan made no reply ."
chesterton#""" What the deuce is the matter with you ?"" demanded the leader , again , his face slowly growing as red as his beard ; then he said , suddenly , and in a more human voice , "" Are you in pain , MacIan ?"" "" Yes ,"" replied the Highlander , without lifting his face . "" Take some brandy ,"" cried Turnbull , walking forward hurriedly towards him . "" You ' ve got it ."" "" It ' s not in the body ,"" said MacIan , in his dull , strange way ."
chesterton#""" The pain has come into my mind . A very dreadful thing has just come into my thoughts ."" "" What the devil are you talking about ?"" asked Turnbull . MacIan broke out with a queer and living voice . "" We must fight now , Turnbull ."
chesterton#"We must fight now . A frightful thing has come upon me , and I know it must be now and here . I must kill you here ,"" he cried , with a sort of tearful rage impossible to describe . "" Here , here , upon this blessed grass ."" "" Why , you idiot ,"" began Turnbull . "" The hour has come -- the black hour God meant for it ."
chesterton#"Quick , it will soon be gone . Quick !"" And he flung the scabbard from him furiously , and stood with the sunlight sparkling along his sword . "" You confounded fool ,"" repeated Turnbull . "" Put that thing up again , you ass ; people will come out of that house at the first clash of the steel ."" "" One of us will be dead before they come ,"" said the other , hoarsely , "" for this is the hour God meant ."""
chesterton#""" Well , I never thought much of God ,"" said the editor of _The Atheist_ , losing all patience . "" And I think less now . Never mind what God meant . Kindly enlighten my pagan darkness as to what the devil _you_ mean ."" "" The hour will soon be gone . In a moment it will be gone ,"" said the madman ."
chesterton#""" It is now , now , now that I must nail your blaspheming body to the earth -- now , now that I must avenge Our Lady on her vile slanderer . Now or never . For the dreadful thought is in my mind ."" "" And what thought ,"" asked Turnbull , with frantic composure , "" occupies what you call your mind ?"" "" I must kill you now ,"" said the fanatic , "" because ----"" "" Well , because ,"" said Turnbull , patiently ."
chesterton#""" Because I have begun to like you ."" Turnbull ' s face had a sudden spasm in the sunlight , a change so instantaneous that it left no trace behind it ; and his features seemed still carved into a cold stare . But when he spoke again he seemed like a man who was placidly pretending to misunderstand something that he understood perfectly well . "" Your affection expresses itself in an abrupt form ,"" he began , but MacIan broke the brittle and frivolous speech to pieces with a violent voice . "" Do not trouble to talk like that ,"" he said . "" You know what I mean as well as I know it ."
chesterton#"Come on and fight , I say . Perhaps you are feeling just as I do ."" Turnbull ' s face flinched again in the fierce sunlight , but his attitude kept its contemptuous ease . "" Your Celtic mind really goes too fast for me ,"" he said ; "" let me be permitted in my heavy Lowland way to understand this new development . My dear Mr . MacIan , what do you really mean ?"" MacIan still kept the shining sword - point towards the other ' s breast ."
chesterton#""" You know what I mean . You mean the same yourself . We must fight now or else ----"" "" Or else ?"" repeated Turnbull , staring at him with an almost blinding gravity . "" Or else we may not want to fight at all ,"" answered Evan , and the end of his speech was like a despairing cry ."
chesterton#"Turnbull took out his own sword suddenly as if to engage ; then planting it point downwards for a moment , he said , "" Before we begin , may I ask you a question ?"" MacIan bowed patiently , but with burning eyes . "" You said , just now ,"" continued Turnbull , presently , "" that if we did not fight now , we might not want to fight at all . How would you feel about the matter if we came not to want to fight at all ?"" "" I should feel ,"" answered the other , "" just as I should feel if you had drawn your sword , and I had run away from it . I should feel that because I had been weak , justice had not been done ."""
chesterton#""" Justice ,"" answered Turnbull , with a thoughtful smile , "" but we are talking about your feelings . And what do you mean by justice , apart from your feelings ?"" MacIan made a gesture of weary recognition ! "" Oh , Nominalism ,"" he said , with a sort of sigh , "" we had all that out in the twelfth century ."" "" I wish we could have it out now ,"" replied the other , firmly . "" Do you really mean that if you came to think me right , you would be certainly wrong ?"""
chesterton#""" If I had a blow on the back of my head , I might come to think you a green elephant ,"" answered MacIan , "" but have I not the right to say now , that if I thought that I should think wrong ?"" "" Then you are quite certain that it would be wrong to like me ?"" asked Turnbull , with a slight smile . "" No ,"" said Evan , thoughtfully , "" I do not say that . It may not be the devil , it may be some part of God I am not meant to know . But I had a work to do , and it is making the work difficult ."""
chesterton#""" And I suppose ,"" said the atheist , quite gently , "" that you and I know all about which part of God we ought to know ."" MacIan burst out like a man driven back and explaining everything . "" The Church is not a thing like the Athenaeum Club ,"" he cried . "" If the Athenaeum Club lost all its members , the Athenaeum Club would dissolve and cease to exist . But when we belong to the Church we belong to something which is outside all of us ; which is outside everything you talk about , outside the Cardinals and the Pope . They belong to it , but it does not belong to them ."
chesterton#"If we all fell dead suddenly , the Church would still somehow exist in God . Confound it all , don ' t you see that I am more sure of its existence than I am of my own existence ? And yet you ask me to trust my temperament , my own temperament , which can be turned upside down by two bottles of claret or an attack of the jaundice . You ask me to trust that when it softens towards you and not to trust the thing which I believe to be outside myself and more real than the blood in my body ."" "" Stop a moment ,"" said Turnbull , in the same easy tone , "" Even in the very act of saying that you believe this or that , you imply that there is a part of yourself that you trust even if there are many parts which you mistrust . If it is only you that like me , surely , also , it is only you that believe in the Catholic Church ."""
chesterton#"Evan remained in an unmoved and grave attitude . "" There is a part of me which is divine ,"" he answered , "" a part that can be trusted , but there are also affections which are entirely animal and idle ."" "" And you are quite certain , I suppose ,"" continued Turnbull , "" that if even you esteem me the esteem would be wholly animal and idle ?"" For the first time MacIan started as if he had not expected the thing that was said to him . At last he said : "" Whatever in earth or heaven it is that has joined us two together , it seems to be something which makes it impossible to lie ."
chesterton#No , I do not think that the movement in me towards you was ... was that surface sort of thing . It may have been something deeper ... something strange . I cannot understand the thing at all . But understand this and understand it thoroughly , if I loved you my love might be divine . No , it is not some trifle that we are fighting about . It is not some superstition or some symbol .
chesterton#"When you wrote those words about Our Lady , you were in that act a wicked man doing a wicked thing . If I hate you it is because you have hated goodness . And if I like you ... it is because you are good ."" Turnbull ' s face wore an indecipherable expression . "" Well , shall we fight now ?"" he said ."
chesterton#""" Yes ,"" said MacIan , with a sudden contraction of his black brows , "" yes , it must be now ."" The bright swords crossed , and the first touch of them , travelling down blade and arm , told each combatant that the heart of the other was awakened . It was not in that way that the swords rang together when they had rushed on each other in the little garden behind the dealer ' s shop . There was a pause , and then MacIan made a movement as if to thrust , and almost at the same moment Turnbull suddenly and calmly dropped his sword . Evan stared round in an unusual bewilderment , and then realized that a large man in pale clothes and a Panama hat was strolling serenely towards them . V . THE PEACEMAKER"
chesterton#When the combatants , with crossed swords , became suddenly conscious of a third party , they each made the same movement . It was as quick as the snap of a pistol , and they altered it instantaneously and recovered their original pose , but they had both made it , they had both seen it , and they both knew what it was . It was not a movement of anger at being interrupted . Say or think what they would , it was a movement of relief . A force within them , and yet quite beyond them , seemed slowly and pitilessly washing away the adamant of their oath . As mistaken lovers might watch the inevitable sunset of first love , these men watched the sunset of their first hatred .
chesterton#Their hearts were growing weaker and weaker against each other . When their weapons rang and riposted in the little London garden , they could have been very certain that if a third party had interrupted them something at least would have happened . They would have killed each other or they would have killed him . But now nothing could undo or deny that flash of fact , that for a second they had been glad to be interrupted . Some new and strange thing was rising higher and higher in their hearts like a high sea at night . It was something that seemed all the more merciless , because it might turn out an enormous mercy .
chesterton#"Was there , perhaps , some such fatalism in friendship as all lovers talk about in love ? Did God make men love each other against their will ? "" I ' m sure you ' ll excuse my speaking to you ,"" said the stranger , in a voice at once eager and deprecating . The voice was too polite for good manners . It was incongruous with the eccentric spectacle of the duellists which ought to have startled a sane and free man . It was also incongruous with the full and healthy , though rather loose physique of the man who spoke ."
chesterton#At the first glance he looked a fine animal , with curling gold beard and hair , and blue eyes , unusually bright . It was only at the second glance that the mind felt a sudden and perhaps unmeaning irritation at the way in which the gold beard retreated backwards into the waistcoat , and the way in which the finely shaped nose went forward as if smelling its way . And it was only , perhaps , at the hundredth glance that the bright blue eyes , which normally before and after the instant seemed brilliant with intelligence , seemed as it were to be brilliant with idiocy . He was a heavy , healthy - looking man , who looked all the larger because of the loose , light coloured clothes that he wore , and that had in their extreme lightness and looseness , almost a touch of the tropics . But a closer examination of his attire would have shown that even in the tropics it would have been unique ; but it was all woven according to some hygienic texture which no human being had ever heard of before , and which was absolutely necessary even for a day ' s health . He wore a huge broad - brimmed hat , equally hygienic , very much at the back of his head , and his voice coming out of so heavy and hearty a type of man was , as I have said , startlingly shrill and deferential .
chesterton#""" I ' m sure you ' ll excuse my speaking to you ,"" he said . "" Now , I wonder if you are in some little difficulty which , after all , we could settle very comfortably together ? Now , you don ' t mind my saying this , do you ?"" The face of both combatants remained somewhat solid under this appeal . But the stranger , probably taking their silence for a gathering shame , continued with a kind of gaiety : "" So you are the young men I have read about in the papers ."
chesterton#"Well , of course , when one is young , one is rather romantic . Do you know what I always say to young people ?"" A blank silence followed this gay inquiry . Then Turnbull said in a colourless voice : "" As I was forty - seven last birthday , I probably came into the world too soon for the experience ."" "" Very good , very good ,"" said the friendly person ."
chesterton#""" Dry Scotch humour . Dry Scotch humour . Well now . I understand that you two people want to fight a duel . I suppose you aren ' t much up in the modern world . We ' ve quite outgrown duelling , you know ."
chesterton#"In fact , Tolstoy tells us that we shall soon outgrow war , which he says is simply a duel between nations . A duel between nations . But there is no doubt about our having outgrown duelling ."" Waiting for some effect upon his wooden auditors , the stranger stood beaming for a moment and then resumed : "" Now , they tell me in the newspapers that you are really wanting to fight about something connected with Roman Catholicism . Now , do you know what I always say to Roman Catholics ?"""
chesterton#""" No ,"" said Turnbull , heavily . "" Do _they_ ?"" It seemed to be a characteristic of the hearty , hygienic gentleman that he always forgot the speech he had made the moment before . Without enlarging further on the fixed form of his appeal to the Church of Rome , he laughed cordially at Turnbull ' s answer ; then his wandering blue eyes caught the sunlight on the swords , and he assumed a good - humoured gravity . "" But you know this is a serious matter ,"" he said , eyeing Turnbull and MacIan , as if they had just been keeping the table in a roar with their frivolities . "" I am sure that if I appealed to your higher natures ... your higher natures ."
chesterton#"Every man has a higher nature and a lower nature . Now , let us put the matter very plainly , and without any romantic nonsense about honour or anything of that sort . Is not bloodshed a great sin ?"" "" No ,"" said MacIan , speaking for the first time . "" Well , really , really !"" said the peacemaker ."
chesterton#""" Murder is a sin ,"" said the immovable Highlander . "" There is no sin of bloodshed ."" "" Well , we won ' t quarrel about a word ,"" said the other , pleasantly . "" Why on earth not ?"" said MacIan , with a sudden asperity . "" Why shouldn ' t we quarrel about a word ?"
chesterton#What is the good of words if they aren ' t important enough to quarrel over ? Why do we choose one word more than another if there isn ' t any difference between them ? If you called a woman a chimpanzee instead of an angel , wouldn ' t there be a quarrel about a word ? If you ' re not going to argue about words , what are you going to argue about ? Are you going to convey your meaning to me by moving your ears ? The Church and the heresies always used to fight about words , because they are the only things worth fighting about .
chesterton#"I say that murder is a sin , and bloodshed is not , and that there is as much difference between those words as there is between the word ' yes ' and the word ' no '; or rather more difference , for ' yes ' and ' no ', at least , belong to the same category . Murder is a spiritual incident . Bloodshed is a physical incident . A surgeon commits bloodshed . "" Ah , you ' re a casuist !"" said the large man , wagging his head ."
chesterton#""" Now , do you know what I always say to casuists ...?"" MacIan made a violent gesture ; and Turnbull broke into open laughter . The peacemaker did not seem to be in the least annoyed , but continued in unabated enjoyment . "" Well , well ,"" he said , "" let us get back to the point . Now Tolstoy has shown that force is no remedy ; so you see the position in which I am placed . I am doing my best to stop what I ' m sure you won ' t mind my calling this really useless violence , this really quite wrong violence of yours ."
chesterton#"But it ' s against my principles to call in the police against you , because the police are still on a lower moral plane , so to speak , because , in short , the police undoubtedly sometimes employ force . Tolstoy has shown that violence merely breeds violence in the person towards whom it is used , whereas Love , on the other hand , breeds Love . So you see how I am placed . I am reduced to use Love in order to stop you . I am obliged to use Love ."" He gave to the word an indescribable sound of something hard and heavy , as if he were saying "" boots ""."
chesterton#"Turnbull suddenly gripped his sword and said , shortly , "" I see how you are placed quite well , sir . You will not call the police . Mr . MacIan , shall we engage ?"" MacIan plucked his sword out of the grass . "" I must and will stop this shocking crime ,"" cried the Tolstoian , crimson in the face . "" It is against all modern ideas ."
chesterton#"It is against the principle of love . How you , sir , who pretend to be a Christian ..."" MacIan turned upon him with a white face and bitter lip . "" Sir ,"" he said , "" talk about the principle of love as much as you like . You seem to me colder than a lump of stone ; but I am willing to believe that you may at some time have loved a cat , or a dog , or a child . When you were a baby , I suppose you loved your mother ."
chesterton#Talk about love , then , till the world is sick of the word . But don ' t you talk about Christianity . Don ' t you dare to say one word , white or black , about it . Christianity is , as far as you are concerned , a horrible mystery . Keep clear of it , keep silent upon it , as you would upon an abomination . It is a thing that has made men slay and torture each other ; and you will never know why .
chesterton#"It is a thing that has made men do evil that good might come ; and you will never understand the evil , let alone the good . Christianity is a thing that could only make you vomit , till you are other than you are . I would not justify it to you even if I could . Hate it , in God ' s name , as Turnbull does , who is a man . It is a monstrous thing , for which men die . And if you will stand here and talk about love for another ten minutes it is very probable that you will see a man die for it ."""
chesterton#"And he fell on guard . Turnbull was busy settling something loose in his elaborate hilt , and the pause was broken by the stranger . "" Suppose I call the police ?"" he said , with a heated face . "" And deny your most sacred dogma ,"" said MacIan . "" Dogma !"""
chesterton#"cried the man , in a sort of dismay . "" Oh , we have no _dogmas_ , you know !"" There was another silence , and he said again , airily : "" You know , I think , there ' s something in what Shaw teaches about no moral principles being quite fixed . Have you ever read _The Quintessence of Ibsenism_ ? Of course he went very wrong over the war ."""
chesterton#"Turnbull , with a bent , flushed face , was tying up the loose piece of the pommel with string . With the string in his teeth , he said , "" Oh , make up your damned mind and clear out !"" "" It ' s a serious thing ,"" said the philosopher , shaking his head . "" I must be alone and consider which is the higher point of view . I rather feel that in a case so extreme as this ..."" and he went slowly away . As he disappeared among the trees , they heard him murmuring in a sing - song voice , "" New occasions teach new duties ,"" out of a poem by James Russell Lowell ."
chesterton#""" Ah ,"" said MacIan , drawing a deep breath . "" Don ' t you believe in prayer now ? I prayed for an angel ."" "" An hour ago ,"" said the Highlander , in his heavy meditative voice , "" I felt the devil weakening my heart and my oath against you , and I prayed that God would send an angel to my aid ."" "" Well ?"" inquired the other , finishing his mending and wrapping the rest of the string round his hand to get a firmer grip ."
chesterton#""" Well ?"" "" Well , that man was an angel ,"" said MacIan . "" I didn ' t know they were as bad as that ,"" answered Turnbull . "" We know that devils sometimes quote Scripture and counterfeit good ,"" replied the mystic . "" Why should not angels sometimes come to show us the black abyss of evil on whose brink we stand . If that man had not tried to stop us ... I might ... I might have stopped ."""
chesterton#""" I know what you mean ,"" said Turnbull , grimly . "" But then he came ,"" broke out MacIan , "" and my soul said to me : ' Give up fighting , and you will become like That . Give up vows and dogmas , and fixed things , and you may grow like That . You may learn , also , that fog of false philosophy . You may grow fond of that mire of crawling , cowardly morals , and you may come to think a blow bad , because it hurts , and not because it humiliates . You may come to think murder wrong , because it is violent , and not because it is unjust ."
chesterton#"Oh , you blasphemer of the good , an hour ago I almost loved you ! But do not fear for me now . I have heard the word Love pronounced in _his_ intonation ; and I know exactly what it means . On guard !'"" The swords caught on each other with a dreadful clang and jar , full of the old energy and hate ; and at once plunged and replunged . Once more each man ' s heart had become the magnet of a mad sword ."
chesterton#"Suddenly , furious as they were , they were frozen for a moment motionless . "" What noise is that ?"" asked the Highlander , hoarsely . "" I think I know ,"" replied Turnbull . "" What ?... What ?"""
chesterton#"cried the other . "" The student of Shaw and Tolstoy has made up his remarkable mind ,"" said Turnbull , quietly . "" The police are coming up the hill ."" VI . THE OTHER PHILOSOPHER Between high hedges in Hertfordshire , hedges so high as to create a kind of grove , two men were running ."
chesterton#They did not run in a scampering or feverish manner , but in the steady swing of the pendulum . Across the great plains and uplands to the right and left of the lane , a long tide of sunset light rolled like a sea of ruby , lighting up the long terraces of the hills and picking out the few windows of the scattered hamlets in startling blood - red sparks . But the lane was cut deep in the hill and remained in an abrupt shadow . The two men running in it had an impression not uncommonly experienced between those wild green English walls ; a sense of being led between the walls of a maze . Though their pace was steady it was vigorous ; their faces were heated and their eyes fixed and bright . There was , indeed , something a little mad in the contrast between the evening ' s stillness over the empty country - side , and these two figures fleeing wildly from nothing .
chesterton#"They had the look of two lunatics , possibly they were . "" Are you all right ?"" said Turnbull , with civility . "" Can you keep this up ?"" "" Quite easily , thank you ,"" replied MacIan . "" I run very well ."""
chesterton#""" Is that a qualification in a family of warriors ?"" asked Turnbull . "" Undoubtedly . Rapid movement is essential ,"" answered MacIan , who never saw a joke in his life . Turnbull broke out into a short laugh , and silence fell between them , the panting silence of runners . Then MacIan said : "" We run better than any of those policemen ."
chesterton#"They are too fat . Why do you make your policemen so fat ?"" "" I didn ' t do much towards making them fat myself ,"" replied Turnbull , genially , "" but I flatter myself that I am now doing something towards making them thin . You ' ll see they will be as lean as rakes by the time they catch us . They will look like your friend , Cardinal Manning ."" "" But they won ' t catch us ,"" said MacIan , in his literal way ."
chesterton#""" No , we beat them in the great military art of running away ,"" returned the other . "" They won ' t catch us unless ----"" MacIan turned his long equine face inquiringly . "" Unless what ?"" he said , for Turnbull had gone silent suddenly , and seemed to be listening intently as he ran as a horse does with his ears turned back . "" Unless what ?"""
chesterton#"repeated the Highlander . "" Unless they do -- what they have done . Listen ."" MacIan slackened his trot , and turned his head to the trail they had left behind them . Across two or three billows of the up and down lane came along the ground the unmistakable throbbing of horses ' hoofs . "" They have put the mounted police on us ,"" said Turnbull , shortly ."
chesterton#""" Good Lord , one would think we were a Revolution ."" "" So we are ,"" said MacIan calmly . "" What shall we do ? Shall we turn on them with our points ?"" "" It may come to that ,"" answered Turnbull , "" though if it does , I reckon that will be the last act . We must put it off if we can ."""
chesterton#"And he stared and peered about him between the bushes . "" If we could hide somewhere the beasts might go by us ,"" he said . "" The police have their faults , but thank God they ' re inefficient . Why , here ' s the very thing . Be quick and quiet . Follow me ."""
chesterton#He suddenly swung himself up the high bank on one side of the lane . It was almost as high and smooth as a wall , and on the top of it the black hedge stood out over them as an angle , almost like a thatched roof of the lane . And the burning evening sky looked down at them through the tangle with red eyes as of an army of goblins . Turnbull hoisted himself up and broke the hedge with his body . As his head and shoulders rose above it they turned to flame in the full glow as if lit up by an immense firelight . His red hair and beard looked almost scarlet , and his pale face as bright as a boy ' s .
chesterton#Something violent , something that was at once love and hatred , surged in the strange heart of the Gael below him . He had an unutterable sense of epic importance , as if he were somehow lifting all humanity into a prouder and more passionate region of the air . As he swung himself up also into the evening light he felt as if he were rising on enormous wings . Legends of the morning of the world which he had heard in childhood or read in youth came back upon him in a cloudy splendour , purple tales of wrath and friendship , like Roland and Oliver , or Balin and Balan , reminding him of emotional entanglements . Men who had loved each other and then fought each other ; men who had fought each other and then loved each other , together made a mixed but monstrous sense of momentousness . The crimson seas of the sunset seemed to him like a bursting out of some sacred blood , as if the heart of the world had broken .
chesterton#"Turnbull was wholly unaffected by any written or spoken poetry ; his was a powerful and prosaic mind . But even upon him there came for the moment something out of the earth and the passionate ends of the sky . The only evidence was in his voice , which was still practical but a shade more quiet . "" Do you see that summer - house - looking thing over there ?"" he asked shortly . "" That will do for us very well ."""
chesterton#"Keeping himself free from the tangle of the hedge he strolled across a triangle of obscure kitchen garden , and approached a dismal shed or lodge a yard or two beyond it . It was a weather - stained hut of grey wood , which with all its desolation retained a tag or two of trivial ornament , which suggested that the thing had once been a sort of summer - house , and the place probably a sort of garden . "" That is quite invisible from the road ,"" said Turnbull , as he entered it , "" and it will cover us up for the night ."" MacIan looked at him gravely for a few moments . "" Sir ,"" he said , "" I ought to say something to you . I ought to say ----"""
chesterton#""" Hush ,"" said Turnbull , suddenly lifting his hand ; "" be still , man ."" In the sudden silence , the drumming of the distant horses grew louder and louder with inconceivable rapidity , and the cavalcade of police rushed by below them in the lane , almost with the roar and rattle of an express train . "" I ought to tell you ,"" continued MacIan , still staring stolidly at the other , "" that you are a great chief , and it is good to go to war behind you ."" Turnbull said nothing , but turned and looked out of the foolish lattice of the little windows , then he said , "" We must have food and sleep first ."" When the last echo of their eluded pursuers had died in the distant uplands , Turnbull began to unpack the provisions with the easy air of a man at a picnic . He had just laid out the last items , put a bottle of wine on the floor , and a tin of salmon on the window - ledge , when the bottomless silence of that forgotten place was broken ."
chesterton#"And it was broken by three heavy blows of a stick delivered upon the door . Turnbull looked up in the act of opening a tin and stared silently at his companion . MacIan ' s long , lean mouth had shut hard . "" Who the devil can that be ?"" said Turnbull . "" God knows ,"" said the other ."
chesterton#""" It might be God ."" Again the sound of the wooden stick reverberated on the wooden door . It was a curious sound and on consideration did not resemble the ordinary effects of knocking on a door for admittance . It was rather as if the point of a stick were plunged again and again at the panels in an absurd attempt to make a hole in them . A wild look sprang into MacIan ' s eyes and he got up half stupidly , with a kind of stagger , put his hand out and caught one of the swords . "" Let us fight at once ,"" he cried , "" it is the end of the world ."""
chesterton#""" You ' re overdone , MacIan ,"" said Turnbull , putting him on one side . "" It ' s only someone playing the goat . Let me open the door ."" But he also picked up a sword as he stepped to open it . He paused one moment with his hand on the handle and then flung the door open . Almost as he did so the ferrule of an ordinary bamboo cane came at his eyes , so that he had actually to parry it with the naked weapon in his hands ."
chesterton#As the two touched , the point of the stick was dropped very abruptly , and the man with the stick stepped hurriedly back . Against the heraldic background of sprawling crimson and gold offered him by the expiring sunset , the figure of the man with the stick showed at first merely black and fantastic . He was a small man with two wisps of long hair that curled up on each side , and seen in silhouette , looked like horns . He had a bow tie so big that the two ends showed on each side of his neck like unnatural stunted wings . He had his long black cane still tilted in his hand like a fencing foil and half presented at the open door . His large straw hat had fallen behind him as he leapt backwards .
chesterton#""" With reference to your suggestion , MacIan ,"" said Turnbull , placidly , "" I think it looks more like the Devil ."" "" Who on earth are you ?"" cried the stranger in a high shrill voice , brandishing his cane defensively . "" Let me see ,"" said Turnbull , looking round to MacIan with the same blandness . "" Who are we ?"" "" Come out ,"" screamed the little man with the stick ."
chesterton#""" Certainly ,"" said Turnbull , and went outside with the sword , MacIan following . Seen more fully , with the evening light on his face , the strange man looked a little less like a goblin . He wore a square pale - grey jacket suit , on which the grey butterfly tie was the only indisputable touch of affectation . Against the great sunset his figure had looked merely small : seen in a more equal light it looked tolerably compact and shapely . His reddish - brown hair , combed into two great curls , looked like the long , slow curling hair of the women in some pre - Raphaelite pictures . But within this feminine frame of hair his face was unexpectedly impudent , like a monkey ' s ."
chesterton#""" What are you doing here ?"" he said , in a sharp small voice . "" Well ,"" said MacIan , in his grave childish way , "" what are _you_ doing here ?"" "" I ,"" said the man , indignantly , "" I ' m in my own garden ."" "" Oh ,"" said MacIan , simply , "" I apologize ."" Turnbull was coolly curling his red moustache , and the stranger stared from one to the other , temporarily stunned by their innocent assurance ."
chesterton#""" But , may I ask ,"" he said at last , "" what the devil you are doing in my summer - house ?"" "" Certainly ,"" said MacIan . "" We were just going to fight ."" "" To fight !"" repeated the man . "" We had better tell this gentleman the whole business ,"" broke in Turnbull ."
chesterton#"Then turning to the stranger he said firmly , "" I am sorry , sir , but we have something to do that must be done . And I may as well tell you at the beginning and to avoid waste of time or language , that we cannot admit any interference ."" "" We were just going to take some slight refreshment when you interrupted us ..."" The little man had a dawning expression of understanding and stooped and picked up the unused bottle of wine , eyeing it curiously . Turnbull continued : "" But that refreshment was preparatory to something which I fear you will find less comprehensible , but on which our minds are entirely fixed , sir ."
chesterton#We are forced to fight a duel . We are forced by honour and an internal intellectual need . Do not , for your own sake , attempt to stop us . I know all the excellent and ethical things that you will want to say to us . I know all about the essential requirements of civil order : I have written leading articles about them all my life . I know all about the sacredness of human life ; I have bored all my friends with it .
chesterton#Try and understand our position . This man and I are alone in the modern world in that we think that God is essentially important . I think He does not exist ; that is where the importance comes in for me . But this man thinks that He does exist , and thinking that very properly thinks Him more important than anything else . Now we wish to make a great demonstration and assertion -- something that will set the world on fire like the first Christian persecutions . If you like , we are attempting a mutual martyrdom .
chesterton#"The papers have posted up every town against us . Scotland Yard has fortified every police station with our enemies ; we are driven therefore to the edge of a lonely lane , and indirectly to taking liberties with your summer - house in order to arrange our ..."" "" Stop !"" roared the little man in the butterfly necktie . "" Put me out of my intellectual misery . Are you really the two tomfools I have read of in all the papers ?"
chesterton#"Are you the two people who wanted to spit each other in the Police Court ? Are you ? Are you ?"" "" Yes ,"" said MacIan , "" it began in a Police Court ."" The little man slung the bottle of wine twenty yards away like a stone . "" Come up to my place ,"" he said ."
chesterton#""" I ' ve got better stuff than that . I ' ve got the best Beaune within fifty miles of here . Come up . You ' re the very men I wanted to see ."" Even Turnbull , with his typical invulnerability , was a little taken aback by this boisterous and almost brutal hospitality . "" Why ... sir ..."" he began ."
chesterton#""" Come up ! Come in !"" howled the little man , dancing with delight . "" I ' ll give you a dinner . I ' ll give you a bed ! I ' ll give you a green smooth lawn and your choice of swords and pistols ."
chesterton#"Why , you fools , I adore fighting ! It ' s the only good thing in God ' s world ! I ' ve walked about these damned fields and longed to see somebody cut up and killed and the blood running . Ha ! Ha !"" And he made sudden lunges with his stick at the trunk of a neighbouring tree so that the ferrule made fierce prints and punctures in the bark ."
chesterton#""" Excuse me ,"" said MacIan suddenly with the wide - eyed curiosity of a child , "" excuse me , but ..."" "" Well ?"" said the small fighter , brandishing his wooden weapon . "" Excuse me ,"" repeated MacIan , "" but was that what you were doing at the door ?"" The little man stared an instant and then said : "" Yes ,"" and Turnbull broke into a guffaw . "" Come on !"""
chesterton#"cried the little man , tucking his stick under his arm and taking quite suddenly to his heels . "" Come on ! Confound me , I ' ll see both of you eat and then I ' ll see one of you die . Lord bless me , the gods must exist after all -- they have sent me one of my day - dreams ! Lord ! A duel !"""
chesterton#"He had gone flying along a winding path between the borders of the kitchen garden , and in the increasing twilight he was as hard to follow as a flying hare . But at length the path after many twists betrayed its purpose and led abruptly up two or three steps to the door of a tiny but very clean cottage . There was nothing about the outside to distinguish it from other cottages , except indeed its ominous cleanliness and one thing that was out of all the custom and tradition of all cottages under the sun . In the middle of the little garden among the stocks and marigolds there surged up in shapeless stone a South Sea Island idol . There was something gross and even evil in that eyeless and alien god among the most innocent of the English flowers . "" Come in !"""
chesterton#"cried the creature again . "" Come in ! it ' s better inside !"" Whether or no it was better inside it was at least a surprise . The moment the two duellists had pushed open the door of that inoffensive , whitewashed cottage they found that its interior was lined with fiery gold . It was like stepping into a chamber in the Arabian Nights ."
chesterton#The door that closed behind them shut out England and all the energies of the West . The ornaments that shone and shimmered on every side of them were subtly mixed from many periods and lands , but were all oriental . Cruel Assyrian bas - reliefs ran along the sides of the passage ; cruel Turkish swords and daggers glinted above and below them ; the two were separated by ages and fallen civilizations . Yet they seemed to sympathize since they were both harmonious and both merciless . The house seemed to consist of chamber within chamber and created that impression as of a dream which belongs also to the Arabian Nights themselves . The innermost room of all was like the inside of a jewel .
chesterton#"The little man who owned it all threw himself on a heap of scarlet and golden cushions and struck his hands together . A negro in a white robe and turban appeared suddenly and silently behind them . "" Selim ,"" said the host , "" these two gentlemen are staying with me tonight . Send up the very best wine and dinner at once . And Selim , one of these gentlemen will probably die tomorrow . Make arrangements , please ."""
chesterton#The negro bowed and withdrew . Evan MacIan came out the next morning into the little garden to a fresh silver day , his long face looking more austere than ever in that cold light , his eyelids a little heavy . He carried one of the swords . Turnbull was in the little house behind him , demolishing the end of an early breakfast and humming a tune to himself , which could be heard through the open window . A moment or two later he leapt to his feet and came out into the sunlight , still munching toast , his own sword stuck under his arm like a walking - stick . Their eccentric host had vanished from sight , with a polite gesture , some twenty minutes before .
chesterton#"They imagined him to be occupied on some concerns in the interior of the house , and they waited for his emergence , stamping the garden in silence -- the garden of tall , fresh country flowers , in the midst of which the monstrous South Sea idol lifted itself as abruptly as the prow of a ship riding on a sea of red and white and gold . It was with a start , therefore , that they came upon the man himself already in the garden . They were all the more startled because of the still posture in which they found him . He was on his knees in front of the stone idol , rigid and motionless , like a saint in a trance or ecstasy . Yet when Turnbull ' s tread broke a twig , he was on his feet in a flash . "" Excuse me ,"" he said with an irradiation of smiles , but yet with a kind of bewilderment ."
chesterton#""" So sorry ... family prayers ... old fashioned ... mother ' s knee . Let us go on to the lawn behind ."" And he ducked rapidly round the statue to an open space of grass on the other side of it . "" This will do us best , Mr . MacIan ,"" said he . Then he made a gesture towards the heavy stone figure on the pedestal which had now its blank and shapeless back turned towards them . "" Don ' t you be afraid ,"" he added , "" he can still see us ."""
chesterton#"MacIan turned his blue , blinking eyes , which seemed still misty with sleep ( or sleeplessness ) towards the idol , but his brows drew together . The little man with the long hair also had his eyes on the back view of the god . His eyes were at once liquid and burning , and he rubbed his hands slowly against each other . "" Do you know ,"" he said , "" I think he can see us better this way . I often think that this blank thing is his real face , watching , though it cannot be watched . He !"
chesterton#"he ! Yes , I think he looks nice from behind . He looks more cruel from behind , don ' t you think ?"" "" What the devil is the thing ?"" asked Turnbull gruffly . "" It is the only Thing there is ,"" answered the other ."
chesterton#""" It is Force ."" "" Oh !"" said Turnbull shortly . "" Yes , my friends ,"" said the little man , with an animated countenance , fluttering his fingers in the air , "" it was no chance that led you to this garden ; surely it was the caprice of some old god , some happy , pitiless god . Perhaps it was his will , for he loves blood ; and on that stone in front of him men have been butchered by hundreds in the fierce , feasting islands of the South . In this cursed , craven place I have not been permitted to kill men on his altar ."
chesterton#"Only rabbits and cats , sometimes ."" In the stillness MacIan made a sudden movement , unmeaning apparently , and then remained rigid . "" But today , today ,"" continued the small man in a shrill voice . "" Today his hour is come . Today his will is done on earth as it is in heaven . Men , men , men will bleed before him today ."""
chesterton#"And he bit his forefinger in a kind of fever . Still , the two duellists stood with their swords as heavily as statues , and the silence seemed to cool the eccentric and call him back to more rational speech . "" Perhaps I express myself a little too lyrically ,"" he said with an amicable abruptness . "" My philosophy has its higher ecstasies , but perhaps you are hardly worked up to them yet . Let us confine ourselves to the unquestioned . You have found your way , gentlemen , by a beautiful accident , to the house of the only man in England ( probably ) who will favour and encourage your most reasonable project ."
chesterton#From Cornwall to Cape Wrath this county is one horrible , solid block of humanitarianism . You will find men who will defend this or that war in a distant continent . They will defend it on the contemptible ground of commerce or the more contemptible ground of social good . But do not fancy that you will find one other person who will comprehend a strong man taking the sword in his hand and wiping out his enemy . My name is Wimpey , Morrice Wimpey . I had a Fellowship at Magdalen .
chesterton#But I assure you I had to drop it , owing to my having said something in a public lecture infringing the popular prejudice against those great gentlemen , the assassins of the Italian Renaissance . They let me say it at dinner and so on , and seemed to like it . But in a public lecture ... so inconsistent . Well , as I say , here is your only refuge and temple of honour . Here you can fall back on that naked and awful arbitration which is the only thing that balances the stars -- a still , continuous violence . _Vae Victis ! _ Down , down , down with the defeated !
chesterton#Victory is the only ultimate fact . Carthage _was_ destroyed , the Red Indians are being exterminated : that is the single certainty . In an hour from now that sun will still be shining and that grass growing , and one of you will be conquered ; one of you will be the conqueror . When it has been done , nothing will alter it . Heroes , I give you the hospitality fit for heroes . And I salute the survivor .
chesterton#"Fall on !"" The two men took their swords . Then MacIan said steadily : "" Mr . Turnbull , lend me your sword a moment ."" Turnbull , with a questioning glance , handed him the weapon . MacIan took the second sword in his left hand and , with a violent gesture , hurled it at the feet of little Mr . Wimpey . "" Fight !"""
chesterton#"he said in a loud , harsh voice . "" Fight me now !"" Wimpey took a step backward , and bewildered words bubbled on his lips . "" Pick up that sword and fight me ,"" repeated MacIan , with brows as black as thunder . The little man turned to Turnbull with a gesture , demanding judgement or protection . "" Really , sir ,"" he began , "" this gentleman confuses ..."""
chesterton#""" You stinking little coward ,"" roared Turnbull , suddenly releasing his wrath . "" Fight , if you ' re so fond of fighting ! Fight , if you ' re so fond of all that filthy philosophy ! If winning is everything , go in and win ! If the weak must go to the wall , go to the wall ! Fight , you rat !"
chesterton#"Fight , or if you won ' t fight -- run !"" And he ran at Wimpey , with blazing eyes . Wimpey staggered back a few paces like a man struggling with his own limbs . Then he felt the furious Scotchman coming at him like an express train , doubling his size every second , with eyes as big as windows and a sword as bright as the sun . Something broke inside him , and he found himself running away , tumbling over his own feet in terror , and crying out as he ran . "" Chase him !"""
chesterton#"shouted Turnbull as MacIan snatched up the sword and joined in the scamper . "" Chase him over a county ! Chase him into the sea ! Shoo ! Shoo ! Shoo !"""
chesterton#The little man plunged like a rabbit among the tall flowers , the two duellists after him . Turnbull kept at his tail with savage ecstasy , still shooing him like a cat . But MacIan , as he ran past the South Sea idol , paused an instant to spring upon its pedestal . For five seconds he strained against the inert mass . Then it stirred ; and he sent it over with a great crash among the flowers , that engulfed it altogether . Then he went bounding after the runaway .
chesterton#In the energy of his alarm the ex - Fellow of Magdalen managed to leap the paling of his garden . The two pursuers went over it after him like flying birds . He fled frantically down a long lane with his two terrors on his trail till he came to a gap in the hedge and went across a steep meadow like the wind . The two Scotchmen , as they ran , kept up a cheery bellowing and waved their swords . Up three slanting meadows , down four slanting meadows on the other side , across another road , across a heath of snapping bracken , through a wood , across another road , and to the brink of a big pool , they pursued the flying philosopher . But when he came to the pool his pace was so precipitate that he could not stop it , and with a kind of lurching stagger , he fell splash into the greasy water .
chesterton#Getting dripping to his feet , with the water up to his knees , the worshipper of force and victory waded disconsolately to the other side and drew himself on to the bank . And Turnbull sat down on the grass and went off into reverberations of laughter . A second afterwards the most extraordinary grimaces were seen to distort the stiff face of MacIan , and unholy sounds came from within . He had never practised laughing , and it hurt him very much . VII . THE VILLAGE OF GRASSLEY - IN - THE - HOLE
chesterton#"At about half past one , under a strong blue sky , Turnbull got up out of the grass and fern in which he had been lying , and his still intermittent laughter ended in a kind of yawn . "" I ' m hungry ,"" he said shortly . "" Are you ?"" "" I have not noticed ,"" answered MacIan . "" What are you going to do ?"" "" There ' s a village down the road , past the pool ,"" answered Turnbull ."
chesterton#""" I can see it from here . I can see the whitewashed walls of some cottages and a kind of corner of the church . How jolly it all looks . It looks so -- I don ' t know what the word is -- so sensible . Don ' t fancy I ' m under any illusions about Arcadian virtue and the innocent villagers . Men make beasts of themselves there with drink , but they don ' t deliberately make devils of themselves with mere talking ."
chesterton#"They kill wild animals in the wild woods , but they don ' t kill cats to the God of Victory . They don ' t ----"" He broke off and suddenly spat on the ground . "" Excuse me ,"" he said ; "" it was ceremonial . One has to get the taste out of one ' s mouth ."" "" The taste of what ?"" asked MacIan ."
chesterton#""" I don ' t know the exact name for it ,"" replied Turnbull . "" Perhaps it is the South Sea Islands , or it may be Magdalen College ."" There was a long pause , and MacIan also lifted his large limbs off the ground -- his eyes particularly dreamy . "" I know what you mean , Turnbull ,"" he said , "" but ... I always thought you people agreed with all that ."" "" With all that about doing as one likes , and the individual , and Nature loving the strongest , and all the things which that cockroach talked about ."" Turnbull ' s big blue - grey eyes stood open with a grave astonishment ."
chesterton#""" Do you really mean to say , MacIan ,"" he said , "" that you fancied that we , the Free - thinkers , that Bradlaugh , or Holyoake , or Ingersoll , believe all that dirty , immoral mysticism about Nature ? Damn Nature !"" "" I supposed you did ,"" said MacIan calmly . "" It seems to me your most conclusive position ."" "" And you mean to tell me ,"" rejoined the other , "" that you broke my window , and challenged me to mortal combat , and tied a tradesman up with ropes , and chased an Oxford Fellow across five meadows -- all under the impression that I am such an illiterate idiot as to believe in Nature !"" "" I supposed you did ,"" repeated MacIan with his usual mildness ; "" but I admit that I know little of the details of your belief -- or disbelief ."""
chesterton#"Turnbull swung round quite suddenly , and set off towards the village . "" Come along ,"" he cried . "" Come down to the village . Come down to the nearest decent inhabitable pub . This is a case for beer ."" "" I do not quite follow you ,"" said the Highlander ."
chesterton#""" Yes , you do ,"" answered Turnbull . "" You follow me slap into the inn - parlour . I repeat , this is a case for beer . We must have the whole of this matter out thoroughly before we go a step farther . Do you know that an idea has just struck me of great simplicity and of some cogency . Do not by any means let us drop our intentions of settling our differences with two steel swords ."
chesterton#"But do you not think that with two pewter pots we might do what we really have never thought of doing yet -- discover what our difference is ?"" "" It never occurred to me before ,"" answered MacIan with tranquillity . "" It is a good suggestion ."" And they set out at an easy swing down the steep road to the village of Grassley - in - the - Hole . Grassley - in - the - Hole was a rude parallelogram of buildings , with two thoroughfares which might have been called two high streets if it had been possible to call them streets . One of these ways was higher on the slope than the other , the whole parallelogram lying aslant , so to speak , on the side of the hill ."
chesterton#The upper of these two roads was decorated with a big public house , a butcher ' s shop , a small public house , a sweetstuff shop , a very small public house , and an illegible signpost . The lower of the two roads boasted a horse - pond , a post office , a gentleman ' s garden with very high hedges , a microscopically small public house , and two cottages . Where all the people lived who supported all the public houses was in this , as in many other English villages , a silent and smiling mystery . The church lay a little above and beyond the village , with a square grey tower dominating it decisively . But even the church was scarcely so central and solemn an institution as the large public house , the Valencourt Arms . It was named after some splendid family that had long gone bankrupt , and whose seat was occupied by a man who had invented a hygienic bootjack ; but the unfathomable sentimentalism of the English people insisted in regarding the Inn , the seat and the sitter in it , as alike parts of a pure and marmoreal antiquity .
chesterton#"And in the Valencourt Arms festivity itself had some solemnity and decorum ; and beer was drunk with reverence , as it ought to be . Into the principal parlour of this place entered two strangers , who found themselves , as is always the case in such hostels , the object , not of fluttered curiosity or pert inquiry , but of steady , ceaseless , devouring ocular study . They had long coats down to their heels , and carried under each coat something that looked like a stick . One was tall and dark , the other short and red - haired . They ordered a pot of ale each . "" MacIan ,"" said Turnbull , lifting his tankard , "" the fool who wanted us to be friends made us want to go on fighting ."
chesterton#"It is only natural that the fool who wanted us to fight should make us friendly . MacIan , your health !"" Dusk was already dropping , the rustics in the tavern were already lurching and lumbering out of it by twos and threes , crying clamorous good nights to a solitary old toper that remained , before MacIan and Turnbull had reached the really important part of their discussion . MacIan wore an expression of sad bewilderment not uncommon with him . "" I am to understand , then ,"" he said , "" that you don ' t believe in nature ."" "" You may say so in a very special and emphatic sense ,"" said Turnbull ."
chesterton#""" I do not believe in nature , just as I do not believe in Odin . She is a myth . It is not merely that I do not believe that nature can guide us . It is that I do not believe that nature exists ."" "" Exists ?"" said MacIan in his monotonous way , settling his pewter pot on the table ."
chesterton#""" Yes , in a real sense nature does not exist . I mean that nobody can discover what the original nature of things would have been if things had not interfered with it . The first blade of grass began to tear up the earth and eat it ; it was interfering with nature , if there is any nature . The first wild ox began to tear up the grass and eat it ; he was interfering with nature , if there is any nature . In the same way ,"" continued Turnbull , "" the human when it asserts its dominance over nature is just as natural as the thing which it destroys ."" "" And in the same way ,"" said MacIan almost dreamily , "" the superhuman , the supernatural is just as natural as the nature which it destroys ."""
chesterton#"Turnbull took his head out of his pewter pot in some anger . "" The supernatural , of course ,"" he said , "" is quite another thing ; the case of the supernatural is simple . The supernatural does not exist ."" "" Quite so ,"" said MacIan in a rather dull voice ; "" you said the same about the natural . If the natural does not exist the supernatural obviously can ' t ."" And he yawned a little over his ale ."
chesterton#"Turnbull turned for some reason a little red and remarked quickly , "" That may be jolly clever , for all I know . But everyone does know that there is a division between the things that as a matter of fact do commonly happen and the things that don ' t . Things that break the evident laws of nature ----"" "" Which does not exist ,"" put in MacIan sleepily . Turnbull struck the table with a sudden hand . "" Good Lord in heaven !"""
chesterton#"he cried ---- "" Who does not exist ,"" murmured MacIan . "" Good Lord in heaven !"" thundered Turnbull , without regarding the interruption . "" Do you really mean to sit there and say that you , like anybody else , would not recognize the difference between a natural occurrence and a supernatural one -- if there could be such a thing ? If I flew up to the ceiling ----"""
chesterton#""" You would bump your head badly ,"" cried MacIan , suddenly starting up . "" One can ' t talk of this kind of thing under a ceiling at all . Come outside ! Come outside and ascend into heaven !"" He burst the door open on a blue abyss of evening and they stepped out into it : it was suddenly and strangely cool . "" Turnbull ,"" said MacIan , "" you have said some things so true and some so false that I want to talk ; and I will try to talk so that you understand ."
chesterton#"For at present you do not understand at all . We don ' t seem to mean the same things by the same words ."" He stood silent for a second or two and then resumed . "" A minute or two ago I caught you out in a real contradiction . At that moment logically I was right . And at that moment I knew I was wrong ."
chesterton#"Yes , there is a real difference between the natural and the supernatural : if you flew up into that blue sky this instant , I should think that you were moved by God -- or the devil . But if you want to know what I really think ... I must explain ."" He stopped again , abstractedly boring the point of his sword into the earth , and went on : "" I was born and bred and taught in a complete universe . The supernatural was not natural , but it was perfectly reasonable . Nay , the supernatural to me is more reasonable than the natural ; for the supernatural is a direct message from God , who is reason ."
chesterton#"I was taught that some things are natural and some things divine . I mean that some things are mechanical and some things divine . But there is the great difficulty , Turnbull . The great difficulty is that , according to my teaching , you are divine ."" "" Me ! Divine ?"""
chesterton#"said Turnbull truculently . "" What do you mean ?"" "" That is just the difficulty ,"" continued MacIan thoughtfully . "" I was told that there was a difference between the grass and a man ' s will ; and the difference was that a man ' s will was special and divine . A man ' s free will , I heard , was supernatural ."" "" Rubbish !"""
chesterton#"said Turnbull . "" Oh ,"" said MacIan patiently , "" then if a man ' s free will isn ' t supernatural , why do your materialists deny that it exists ?"" Turnbull was silent for a moment . Then he began to speak , but MacIan continued with the same steady voice and sad eyes : "" So what I feel is this : Here is the great divine creation I was taught to believe in . I can understand your disbelieving in it , but why disbelieve in a part of it ?"
chesterton#"It was all one thing to me . God had authority because he was God . Man had authority because he was man . You cannot prove that God is better than a man ; nor can you prove that a man is better than a horse . Why permit any ordinary thing ? Why do you let a horse be saddled ?"""
chesterton#""" Some modern thinkers disapprove of it ,"" said Turnbull a little doubtfully . "" I know ,"" said MacIan grimly ; "" that man who talked about love , for instance ."" Turnbull made a humorous grimace ; then he said : "" We seem to be talking in a kind of shorthand ; but I won ' t pretend not to understand you . What you mean is this : that you learnt about all your saints and angels at the same time as you learnt about common morality , from the same people , in the same way . And you mean to say that if one may be disputed , so may the other . Well , let that pass for the moment ."
chesterton#"But let me ask you a question in turn . Did not this system of yours , which you swallowed whole , contain all sorts of things that were merely local , the respect for the chief of your clan , or such things ; the village ghost , the family feud , or what not ? Did you not take in those things , too , along with your theology ?"" MacIan stared along the dim village road , down which the last straggler from the inn was trailing his way . "" What you say is not unreasonable ,"" he said . "" But it is not quite true ."
chesterton#"The distinction between the chief and us did exist ; but it was never anything like the distinction between the human and the divine , or the human and the animal . It was more like the distinction between one animal and another . But ----"" "" Well ?"" said Turnbull . MacIan was silent ."
chesterton#""" Go on ,"" repeated Turnbull ; "" what ' s the matter with you ? What are you staring at ?"" "" I am staring ,"" said MacIan at last , "" at that which shall judge us both ."" "" Oh , yes ,"" said Turnbull in a tired way , "" I suppose you mean God ."" "" No , I don ' t ,"" said MacIan , shaking his head . "" I mean him ."""
chesterton#"And he pointed to the half - tipsy yokel who was ploughing down the road . "" What do you mean ?"" asked the atheist . "" I mean him ,"" repeated MacIan with emphasis . "" He goes out in the early dawn ; he digs or he ploughs a field . Then he comes back and drinks ale , and then he sings a song ."
chesterton#"All your philosophies and political systems are young compared to him . All your hoary cathedrals , yes , even the Eternal Church on earth is new compared to him . The most mouldering gods in the British Museum are new facts beside him . It is he who in the end shall judge us all ."" And MacIan rose to his feet with a vague excitement . "" What are you going to do ?"""
chesterton#""" I am going to ask him ,"" cried MacIan , "" which of us is right ."" Turnbull broke into a kind of laugh . "" Ask that intoxicated turnip - eater ----"" he began . "" Yes -- which of us is right ,"" cried MacIan violently . "" Oh , you have long words and I have long words ; and I talk of every man being the image of God ; and you talk of every man being a citizen and enlightened enough to govern . But if every man typifies God , there is God ."
chesterton#"If every man is an enlightened citizen , there is your enlightened citizen . The first man one meets is always man . Let us catch him up ."" And in gigantic strides the long , lean Highlander whirled away into the grey twilight , Turnbull following with a good - humoured oath . The track of the rustic was easy to follow , even in the faltering dark ; for he was enlivening his wavering walk with song . It was an interminable poem , beginning with some unspecified King William , who ( it appeared ) lived in London town and who after the second rise vanished rather abruptly from the train of thought ."
chesterton#The rest was almost entirely about beer and was thick with local topography of a quite unrecognizable kind . The singer ' s step was neither very rapid , nor , indeed , exceptionally secure ; so the song grew louder and louder and the two soon overtook him . He was a man elderly or rather of any age , with lean grey hair and a lean red face , but with that remarkable rustic physiognomy in which it seems that all the features stand out independently from the face ; the rugged red nose going out like a limb ; the bleared blue eyes standing out like signals . He gave them greeting with the elaborate urbanity of the slightly intoxicated . MacIan , who was vibrating with one of his silent , violent decisions , opened the question without delay . He explained the philosophic position in words as short and simple as possible .
chesterton#"But the singular old man with the lank red face seemed to think uncommonly little of the short words . He fixed with a fierce affection upon one or two of the long ones . "" Atheists !"" he repeated with luxurious scorn . "" Atheists ! I know their sort , master ."
chesterton#"Atheists ! Don ' t talk to me about ' un . Atheists !"" The grounds of his disdain seemed a little dark and confused ; but they were evidently sufficient . MacIan resumed in some encouragement : "" You think as I do , I hope ; you think that a man should be connected with the Church ; with the common Christian ----"""
chesterton#"The old man extended a quivering stick in the direction of a distant hill . "" There ' s the church ,"" he said thickly . "" Grassley old church that is . Pulled down it was , in the old squire ' s time , and ----"" "" I mean ,"" explained MacIan elaborately , "" that you think that there should be someone typifying religion , a priest ----"" "" Priests !"""
chesterton#"said the old man with sudden passion . "" Priests ! I know ' un . What they want in England ? That ' s what I say . What they want in England ?"""
chesterton#""" They want you ,"" said MacIan . "" Quite so ,"" said Turnbull , "" and me ; but they won ' t get us . MacIan , your attempt on the primitive innocence does not seem very successful . Let me try . What you want , my friend , is your rights . You don ' t want any priests or churches ."
chesterton#"A vote , a right to speak is what you ----"" "" Who says I a ' n ' t got a right to speak ?"" said the old man , facing round in an irrational frenzy . "" I got a right to speak . I ' m a man , I am . I don ' t want no votin ' nor priests ."
chesterton#"I say a man ' s a man ; that ' s what I say . If a man a ' n ' t a man , what is he ? That ' s what I say , if a man a ' n ' t a man , what is he ? When I sees a man , I sez ' e ' s a man ."" "" Quite so ,"" said Turnbull , "" a citizen ."" "" I say he ' s a man ,"" said the rustic furiously , stopping and striking his stick on the ground ."
chesterton#""" Not a city or owt else . He ' s a man ."" "" You ' re perfectly right ,"" said the sudden voice of MacIan , falling like a sword . "" And you have kept close to something the whole world of today tries to forget ."" "" Good night ."" And the old man went on wildly singing into the night ."
chesterton#""" A jolly old creature ,"" said Turnbull ; "" he didn ' t seem able to get much beyond that fact that a man is a man ."" "" Has anybody got beyond it ?"" asked MacIan . Turnbull looked at him curiously . "" Are you turning an agnostic ?"" he asked ."
chesterton#""" Oh , you do not understand !"" cried out MacIan . "" We Catholics are all agnostics . We Catholics have only in that sense got as far as realizing that man is a man . But your Ibsens and your Zolas and your Shaws and your Tolstoys have not even got so far ."" VIII ."
chesterton#AN INTERLUDE OF ARGUMENT Morning broke in bitter silver along the grey and level plain ; and almost as it did so Turnbull and MacIan came out of a low , scrubby wood on to the empty and desolate flats . They had walked all night . They had walked all night and talked all night also , and if the subject had been capable of being exhausted they would have exhausted it . Their long and changing argument had taken them through districts and landscapes equally changing . They had discussed Haeckel upon hills so high and steep that in spite of the coldness of the night it seemed as if the stars might burn them .
chesterton#They had explained and re - explained the Massacre of St . Bartholomew in little white lanes walled in with standing corn as with walls of gold . They had talked about Mr . Kensit in dim and twinkling pine woods , amid the bewildering monotony of the pines . And it was with the end of a long speech from MacIan , passionately defending the practical achievements and the solid prosperity of the Catholic tradition , that they came out upon the open land . MacIan had learnt much and thought more since he came out of the cloudy hills of Arisaig . He had met many typical modern figures under circumstances which were sharply symbolic ; and , moreover , he had absorbed the main modern atmosphere from the mere presence and chance phrases of Turnbull , as such atmospheres can always be absorbed from the presence and the phrases of any man of great mental vitality . He had at last begun thoroughly to understand what are the grounds upon which the mass of the modern world solidly disapprove of her creed ; and he threw himself into replying to them with a hot intellectual enjoyment .
chesterton#""" I begin to understand one or two of your dogmas , Mr . Turnbull ,"" he had said emphatically as they ploughed heavily up a wooded hill . "" And every one that I understand I deny . Take any one of them you like . You hold that your heretics and sceptics have helped the world forward and handed on a lamp of progress . I deny it . Nothing is plainer from real history than that each of your heretics invented a complete cosmos of his own which the next heretic smashed entirely to pieces ."
chesterton#Who knows now exactly what Nestorius taught ? Who cares ? There are only two things that we know for certain about it . The first is that Nestorius , as a heretic , taught something quite opposite to the teaching of Arius , the heretic who came before him , and something quite useless to James Turnbull , the heretic who comes after . I defy you to go back to the Free - thinkers of the past and find any habitation for yourself at all . I defy you to read Godwin or Shelley or the deists of the eighteenth century of the nature - worshipping humanists of the Renaissance , without discovering that you differ from them twice as much as you differ from the Pope .
chesterton#You are a nineteenth - century sceptic , and you are always telling me that I ignore the cruelty of nature . If you had been an eighteenth - century sceptic you would have told me that I ignore the kindness and benevolence of nature . You are an atheist , and you praise the deists of the eighteenth century . Read them instead of praising them , and you will find that their whole universe stands or falls with the deity . You are a materialist , and you think Bruno a scientific hero . See what he said and you will think him an insane mystic .
chesterton#No , the great Free - thinker , with his genuine ability and honesty , does not in practice destroy Christianity . What he does destroy is the Free - thinker who went before . Free - thought may be suggestive , it may be inspiriting , it may have as much as you please of the merits that come from vivacity and variety . But there is one thing Free - thought can never be by any possibility -- Free - thought can never be progressive . It can never be progressive because it will accept nothing from the past ; it begins every time again from the beginning ; and it goes every time in a different direction . All the rational philosophers have gone along different roads , so it is impossible to say which has gone farthest .
chesterton#"Who can discuss whether Emerson was a better optimist than Schopenhauer was pessimist ? It is like asking if this corn is as yellow as that hill is steep . No ; there are only two things that really progress ; and they both accept accumulations of authority . They may be progressing uphill and down ; they may be growing steadily better or steadily worse ; but they have steadily increased in certain definable matters ; they have steadily advanced in a certain definable direction ; they are the only two things , it seems , that ever _can_ progress . The first is strictly physical science . The second is the Catholic Church ."""
chesterton#""" Physical science and the Catholic Church !"" said Turnbull sarcastically ; "" and no doubt the first owes a great deal to the second ."" "" If you pressed that point I might reply that it was very probable ,"" answered MacIan calmly . "" I often fancy that your historical generalizations rest frequently on random instances ; I should not be surprised if your vague notions of the Church as the persecutor of science was a generalization from Galileo . I should not be at all surprised if , when you counted the scientific investigations and discoveries since the fall of Rome , you found that a great mass of them had been made by monks . But the matter is irrelevant to my meaning ."
chesterton#"I say that if you want an example of anything which has progressed in the moral world by the same method as science in the material world , by continually adding to without unsettling what was there before , then I say that there _is_ only one example of it . And that is Us ."" "" With this enormous difference ,"" said Turnbull , "" that however elaborate be the calculations of physical science , their net result can be tested . Granted that it took millions of books I never read and millions of men I never heard of to discover the electric light . Still I can see the electric light . But I cannot see the supreme virtue which is the result of all your theologies and sacraments ."""
chesterton#""" Catholic virtue is often invisible because it is the normal ,"" answered MacIan . "" Christianity is always out of fashion because it is always sane ; and all fashions are mild insanities . When Italy is mad on art the Church seems too Puritanical ; when England is mad on Puritanism the Church seems too artistic . When you quarrel with us now you class us with kingship and despotism ; but when you quarrelled with us first it was because we would not accept the divine despotism of Henry VIII . The Church always seems to be behind the times , when it is really beyond the times ; it is waiting till the last fad shall have seen its last summer . It keeps the key of a permanent virtue ."""
chesterton#""" Oh , I have heard all that !"" said Turnbull with genial contempt . "" I have heard that Christianity keeps the key of virtue , and that if you read Tom Paine you will cut your throat at Monte Carlo . It is such rubbish that I am not even angry at it . You say that Christianity is the prop of morals ; but what more do you do ? When a doctor attends you and could poison you with a pinch of salt , do you ask whether he is a Christian ?"
chesterton#"You ask whether he is a gentleman , whether he is an M . D .-- anything but that . When a soldier enlists to die for his country or disgrace it , do you ask whether he is a Christian ? You are more likely to ask whether he is Oxford or Cambridge at the boat race . If you think your creed essential to morals why do you not make it a test for these things ?"" "" We once did make it a test for these things ,"" said MacIan smiling , "" and then you told us that we were imposing by force a faith unsupported by argument . It seems rather hard that having first been told that our creed must be false because we did use tests , we should now be told that it must be false because we don ' t ."
chesterton#"But I notice that most anti - Christian arguments are in the same inconsistent style ."" "" That is all very well as a debating - club answer ,"" replied Turnbull good - humouredly , "" but the question still remains : Why don ' t you confine yourself more to Christians if Christians are the only really good men ?"" "" Who talked of such folly ?"" asked MacIan disdainfully . "" Do you suppose that the Catholic Church ever held that Christians were the only good men ? Why , the Catholics of the Catholic Middle Ages talked about the virtues of all the virtuous Pagans until humanity was sick of the subject ."
chesterton#No , if you really want to know what we mean when we say that Christianity has a special power of virtue , I will tell you . The Church is the only thing on earth that can perpetuate a type of virtue and make it something more than a fashion . The thing is so plain and historical that I hardly think you will ever deny it . You cannot deny that it is perfectly possible that tomorrow morning , in Ireland or in Italy , there might appear a man not only as good but good in exactly the same way as St . Francis of Assisi . Very well , now take the other types of human virtue ; many of them splendid . The English gentleman of Elizabeth was chivalrous and idealistic .
chesterton#But can you stand still here in this meadow and _be_ an English gentleman of Elizabeth ? The austere republican of the eighteenth century , with his stern patriotism and his simple life , was a fine fellow . But have you ever seen him ? have you ever seen an austere republican ? Only a hundred years have passed and that volcano of revolutionary truth and valour is as cold as the mountains of the moon . And so it is and so it will be with the ethics which are buzzing down Fleet Street at this instant as I speak .
chesterton#What phrase would inspire the London clerk or workman just now ? Perhaps that he is a son of the British Empire on which the sun never sets ; perhaps that he is a prop of his Trades Union , or a class - conscious proletarian something or other ; perhaps merely that he is a gentleman when he obviously is not . Those names and notions are all honourable ; but how long will they last ? Empires break ; industrial conditions change ; the suburbs will not last for ever . What will remain ? I will tell you .
chesterton#"The Catholic Saint will remain ."" "" And suppose I don ' t like him ?"" said Turnbull . "" On my theory the question is rather whether he will like you : or more probably whether he will ever have heard of you . But I grant the reasonableness of your query . You have a right , if you speak as the ordinary man , to ask if you will like the saint ."
chesterton#But as the ordinary man you do like him . You revel in him . If you dislike him it is not because you are a nice ordinary man , but because you are ( if you will excuse me ) a sophisticated prig of a Fleet Street editor . That is just the funny part of it . The human race has always admired the Catholic virtues , however little it can practise them ; and oddly enough it has admired most those of them that the modern world most sharply disputes . You complain of Catholicism for setting up an ideal of virginity ; it did nothing of the kind .
chesterton#"The whole human race set up an ideal of virginity ; the Greeks in Athene , the Romans in the Vestal fire , set up an ideal of virginity . What then is your real quarrel with Catholicism ? Your quarrel can only be , your quarrel really only is , that Catholicism has _achieved_ an ideal of virginity ; that it is no longer a mere piece of floating poetry . But if you , and a few feverish men , in top hats , running about in a street in London , choose to differ as to the ideal itself , not only from the Church , but from the Parthenon whose name means virginity , from the Roman Empire which went outwards from the virgin flame , from the whole legend and tradition of Europe , from the lion who will not touch virgins , from the unicorn who respects them , and who make up together the bearers of your own national shield , from the most living and lawless of your own poets , from Massinger , who wrote the _Virgin Martyr_ , from Shakespeare , who wrote _Measure for Measure_ -- if you in Fleet Street differ from all this human experience , does it never strike you that it may be Fleet Street that is wrong ?"" "" No ,"" answered Turnbull ; "" I trust that I am sufficiently fair - minded to canvass and consider the idea ; but having considered it , I think Fleet Street is right , yes -- even if the Parthenon is wrong . I think that as the world goes on new psychological atmospheres are generated , and in these atmospheres it is possible to find delicacies and combinations which in other times would have to be represented by some ruder symbol ."
chesterton#"Every man feels the need of some element of purity in sex ; perhaps they can only typify purity as the absence of sex . You will laugh if I suggest that we may have made in Fleet Street an atmosphere in which a man can be so passionate as Sir Lancelot and as pure as Sir Galahad . But , after all , we have in the modern world erected many such atmospheres . We have , for instance , a new and imaginative appreciation of children ."" "" Quite so ,"" replied MacIan with a singular smile . "" It has been very well put by one of the brightest of your young authors , who said : ' Unless you become as little children ye shall in no wise enter the kingdom of heaven .'"
chesterton#"But you are quite right ; there is a modern worship of children . And what , I ask you , is this modern worship of children ? What , in the name of all the angels and devils , is it except a worship of virginity ? Why should anyone worship a thing merely because it is small or immature ? No ; you have tried to escape from this thing , and the very thing you point to as the goal of your escape is only the thing again . Am I wrong in saying that these things seem to be eternal ?"""
chesterton#"And it was with these words that they came in sight of the great plains . They went a little way in silence , and then James Turnbull said suddenly , "" But I _cannot_ believe in the thing ."" MacIan answered nothing to the speech ; perhaps it is unanswerable . And indeed they scarcely spoke another word to each other all that day . IX . THE STRANGE LADY"
chesterton#"Moonrise with a great and growing moon opened over all those flats , making them seem flatter and larger than they were , turning them to a lake of blue light . The two companions trudged across the moonlit plain for half an hour in full silence . Then MacIan stopped suddenly and planted his sword - point in the ground like one who plants his tent - pole for the night . Leaving it standing there , he clutched his black - haired skull with his great claws of hands , as was his custom when forcing the pace of his brain . Then his hands dropped again and he spoke . "" I ' m sure you ' re thinking the same as I am ,"" he said ; "" how long are we to be on this damned seesaw ?"""
chesterton#"The other did not answer , but his silence seemed somehow solid as assent ; and MacIan went on conversationally . Neither noticed that both had instinctively stood still before the sign of the fixed and standing sword . "" It is hard to guess what God means in this business . But he means something -- or the other thing , or both . Whenever we have tried to fight each other something has stopped us . Whenever we have tried to be reconciled to each other , something has stopped us again ."
chesterton#"By the run of our luck we have never had time to be either friends or enemies . Something always jumped out of the bushes ."" Turnbull nodded gravely and glanced round at the huge and hedgeless meadow which fell away towards the horizon into a glimmering high road . "" Nothing will jump out of bushes here anyhow ,"" he said . "" That is what I meant ,"" said MacIan , and stared steadily at the heavy hilt of his standing sword , which in the slight wind swayed on its tempered steel like some huge thistle on its stalk . "" That is what I meant ; we are quite alone here ."
chesterton#"I have not heard a horse - hoof or a footstep or the hoot of a train for miles . So I think we might stop here and ask for a miracle ."" "" Oh ! might we ?"" said the atheistic editor with a sort of gusto of disgust . "" I beg your pardon ,"" said MacIan , meekly ."
chesterton#""" I forgot your prejudices ."" He eyed the wind - swung sword - hilt in sad meditation and resumed : "" What I mean is , we might find out in this quiet place whether there really is any fate or any commandment against our enterprise . I will engage on my side , like Elijah , to accept a test from heaven . Turnbull , let us draw swords here in this moonlight and this monstrous solitude . And if here in this moonlight and solitude there happens anything to interrupt us -- if it be lightning striking our sword - blades or a rabbit running under our legs -- I will take it as a sign from God and we will shake hands for ever ."" Turnbull ' s mouth twitched in angry humour under his red moustache ."
chesterton#"He said : "" I will wait for signs from God until I have any signs of His existence ; but God -- or Fate -- forbid that a man of scientific culture should refuse any kind of experiment ."" "" Very well , then ,"" said MacIan , shortly . "" We are more quiet here than anywhere else ; let us engage ."" And he plucked his sword - point out of the turf . Turnbull regarded him for a second and a half with a baffling visage almost black against the moonrise ; then his hand made a sharp movement to his hip and his sword shone in the moon . As old chess - players open every game with established gambits , they opened with a thrust and parry , orthodox and even frankly ineffectual ."
chesterton#But in MacIan ' s soul more formless storms were gathering , and he made a lunge or two so savage as first to surprise and then to enrage his opponent . Turnbull ground his teeth , kept his temper , and waiting for the third lunge , and the worst , had almost spitted the lunger when a shrill , small cry came from behind him , a cry such as is not made by any of the beasts that perish . Turnbull must have been more superstitious than he knew , for he stopped in the act of going forward . MacIan was brazenly superstitious , and he dropped his sword . After all , he had challenged the universe to send an interruption ; and this was an interruption , whatever else it was . An instant afterwards the sharp , weak cry was repeated .
chesterton#"This time it was certain that it was human and that it was female . MacIan stood rolling those great blue Gaelic eyes that contrasted with his dark hair . "" It is the voice of God ,"" he said again and again . "" God hasn ' t got much of a voice ,"" said Turnbull , who snatched at every chance of cheap profanity . "" As a matter of fact , MacIan , it isn ' t the voice of God , but it ' s something a jolly sight more important -- it is the voice of man -- or rather of woman . So I think we ' d better scoot in its direction ."""
chesterton#MacIan snatched up his fallen weapon without a word , and the two raced away towards that part of the distant road from which the cry was now constantly renewed . They had to run over a curve of country that looked smooth but was very rough ; a neglected field which they soon found to be full of the tallest grasses and the deepest rabbit - holes . Moreover , that great curve of the countryside which looked so slow and gentle when you glanced over it , proved to be highly precipitous when you scampered over it ; and Turnbull was twice nearly flung on his face . MacIan , though much heavier , avoided such an overthrow only by having the quick and incalculable feet of the mountaineer ; but both of them may be said to have leapt off a low cliff when they leapt into the road . The moonlight lay on the white road with a more naked and electric glare than on the grey - green upland , and though the scene which it revealed was complicated , it was not difficult to get its first features at a glance . A small but very neat black - and - yellow motor - car was standing stolidly , slightly to the left of the road .
chesterton#A somewhat larger light - green motor - car was tipped half - way into a ditch on the same side , and four flushed and staggering men in evening dress were tipped out of it . Three of them were standing about the road , giving their opinions to the moon with vague but echoing violence . The fourth , however , had already advanced on the chauffeur of the black - and - yellow car , and was threatening him with a stick . The chauffeur had risen to defend himself . By his side sat a young lady . She was sitting bolt upright , a slender and rigid figure gripping the sides of her seat , and her first few cries had ceased .
chesterton#She was clad in close - fitting dark costume , a mass of warm brown hair went out in two wings or waves on each side of her forehead ; and even at that distance it could be seen that her profile was of the aquiline and eager sort , like a young falcon hardly free of the nest . Turnbull had concealed in him somewhere a fund of common sense and knowledge of the world of which he himself and his best friends were hardly aware . He was one of those who take in much of the shows of things absent - mindedly , and in an irrelevant reverie . As he stood at the door of his editorial shop on Ludgate Hill and meditated on the non - existence of God , he silently absorbed a good deal of varied knowledge about the existence of men . He had come to know types by instinct and dilemmas with a glance ; he saw the crux of the situation in the road , and what he saw made him redouble his pace . He knew that the men were rich ; he knew that they were drunk ; and he knew , what was worst of all , that they were fundamentally frightened .
chesterton#"And he knew this also , that no common ruffian ( such as attacks ladies in novels ) is ever so savage and ruthless as a coarse kind of gentleman when he is really alarmed . The reason is not recondite ; it is simply because the police - court is not such a menacing novelty to the poor ruffian as it is to the rich . When they came within hail and heard the voices , they confirmed all Turnbull ' s anticipations . The man in the middle of the road was shouting in a hoarse and groggy voice that the chauffeur had smashed their car on purpose ; that they must get to the Cri that evening , and that he would jolly well have to take them there . The chauffeur had mildly objected that he was driving a lady . "" Oh !"
chesterton#"we ' ll take care of the lady ,"" said the red - faced young man , and went off into gurgling and almost senile laughter . By the time the two champions came up , things had grown more serious . The intoxication of the man talking to the chauffeur had taken one of its perverse and catlike jumps into mere screaming spite and rage . He lifted his stick and struck at the chauffeur , who caught hold of it , and the drunkard fell backwards , dragging him out of his seat on the car . Another of the rowdies rushed forward booing in idiot excitement , fell over the chauffeur , and , either by accident or design , kicked him as he lay . The drunkard got to his feet again ; but the chauffeur did not ."
chesterton#The man who had kicked kept a kind of half - witted conscience or cowardice , for he stood staring at the senseless body and murmuring words of inconsequent self - justification , making gestures with his hands as if he were arguing with somebody . But the other three , with a mere whoop and howl of victory , were boarding the car on three sides at once . It was exactly at this moment that Turnbull fell among them like one fallen from the sky . He tore one of the climbers backward by the collar , and with a hearty push sent him staggering over into the ditch upon his nose . One of the remaining two , who was too far gone to notice anything , continued to clamber ineffectually over the high back of the car , kicking and pouring forth a rivulet of soliloquy . But the other dropped at the interruption , turned upon Turnbull and began a battering bout of fisticuffs .
chesterton#At the same moment the man crawled out of the ditch in a masquerade of mud and rushed at his old enemy from behind . The whole had not taken a second ; and an instant after MacIan was in the midst of them . Turnbull had tossed away his sheathed sword , greatly preferring his hands , except in the avowed etiquette of the duel ; for he had learnt to use his hands in the old street - battles of Bradlaugh . But to MacIan the sword even sheathed was a more natural weapon , and he laid about him on all sides with it as with a stick . The man who had the walking - stick found his blows parried with promptitude ; and a second after , to his great astonishment , found his own stick fly up in the air as by a conjuring trick , with a turn of the swordsman ' s wrist . Another of the revellers picked the stick out of the ditch and ran in upon MacIan , calling to his companion to assist him .
chesterton#""" I haven ' t got a stick ,"" grumbled the disarmed man , and looked vaguely about the ditch . "" Perhaps ,"" said MacIan , politely , "" you would like this one ."" With the word the drunkard found his hand that had grasped the stick suddenly twisted and empty ; and the stick lay at the feet of his companion on the other side of the road . MacIan felt a faint stir behind him ; the girl had risen to her feet and was leaning forward to stare at the fighters . Turnbull was still engaged in countering and pommelling with the third young man . The fourth young man was still engaged with himself , kicking his legs in helpless rotation on the back of the car and talking with melodious rationality ."
chesterton#At length Turnbull ' s opponent began to back before the battery of his heavy hands , still fighting , for he was the soberest and boldest of the four . If these are annals of military glory , it is due to him to say that he need not have abandoned the conflict ; only that as he backed to the edge of the ditch his foot caught in a loop of grass and he went over in a flat and comfortable position from which it took him a considerable time to rise . By the time he had risen , Turnbull had come to the rescue of MacIan , who was at bay but belabouring his two enemies handsomely . The sight of the liberated reserve was to them like that of Blucher at Waterloo ; the two set off at a sullen trot down the road , leaving even the walking - stick lying behind them in the moonlight . MacIan plucked the struggling and aspiring idiot off the back of the car like a stray cat , and left him swaying unsteadily in the moon . Then he approached the front part of the car in a somewhat embarrassed manner and pulled off his cap .
chesterton#For some solid seconds the lady and he merely looked at each other , and MacIan had an irrational feeling of being in a picture hung on a wall . That is , he was motionless , even lifeless , and yet staringly significant , like a picture . The white moonlight on the road , when he was not looking at it , gave him a vision of the road being white with snow . The motor - car , when he was not looking at it , gave him a rude impression of a captured coach in the old days of highwaymen . And he whose whole soul was with the swords and stately manners of the eighteenth century , he who was a Jacobite risen from the dead , had an overwhelming sense of being once more in the picture , when he had so long been out of the picture . In that short and strong silence he absorbed the lady from head to foot .
chesterton#He had never really looked at a human being before in his life . He saw her face and hair first , then that she had long suede gloves ; then that there was a fur cap at the back of her brown hair . He might , perhaps , be excused for this hungry attention . He had prayed that some sign might come from heaven ; and after an almost savage scrutiny he came to the conclusion that his one did . The lady ' s instantaneous arrest of speech might need more explaining ; but she may well have been stunned with the squalid attack and the abrupt rescue . Yet it was she who remembered herself first and suddenly called out with self - accusing horror :
chesterton#""" Oh , that poor , poor man !"" They both swung round abruptly and saw that Turnbull , with his recovered sword under his arm - pit , was already lifting the fallen chauffeur into the car . He was only stunned and was slowly awakening , feebly waving his left arm . The lady in long gloves and the fur cap leapt out and ran rapidly towards them , only to be reassured by Turnbull , who ( unlike many of his school ) really knew a little science when he invoked it to redeem the world . "" He ' s all right ,"" said he ; "" he ' s quite safe . But I ' m afraid he won ' t be able to drive the car for half an hour or so ."""
chesterton#""" I can drive the car ,"" said the young woman in the fur cap with stony practicability . "" Oh , in that case ,"" began MacIan , uneasily ; and that paralysing shyness which is a part of romance induced him to make a backward movement as if leaving her to herself . But Turnbull was more rational than he , being more indifferent . "" I don ' t think you ought to drive home alone , ma ' am ,"" he said , gruffly . "" There seem to be a lot of rowdy parties along this road , and the man will be no use for an hour . If you will tell us where you are going , we will see you safely there and say good night ."""
chesterton#"The young lady exhibited all the abrupt disturbance of a person who is not commonly disturbed . She said almost sharply and yet with evident sincerity : "" Of course I am awfully grateful to you for all you ' ve done -- and there ' s plenty of room if you ' ll come in ."" Turnbull , with the complete innocence of an absolutely sound motive , immediately jumped into the car ; but the girl cast an eye at MacIan , who stood in the road for an instant as if rooted like a tree . Then he also tumbled his long legs into the tonneau , having that sense of degradedly diving into heaven which so many have known in so many human houses when they consented to stop to tea or were allowed to stop to supper . The slowly reviving chauffeur was set in the back seat ; Turnbull and MacIan had fallen into the middle one ; the lady with a steely coolness had taken the driver ' s seat and all the handles of that headlong machine . A moment afterwards the engine started , with a throb and leap unfamiliar to Turnbull , who had only once been in a motor during a general election , and utterly unknown to MacIan , who in his present mood thought it was the end of the world ."
chesterton#Almost at the same instant that the car plucked itself out of the mud and whipped away up the road , the man who had been flung into the ditch rose waveringly to his feet . When he saw the car escaping he ran after it and shouted something which , owing to the increasing distance , could not be heard . It is awful to reflect that , if his remark was valuable , it is quite lost to the world . The car shot on up and down the shining moonlit lanes , and there was no sound in it except the occasional click or catch of its machinery ; for through some cause or other no soul inside it could think of a word to say . The lady symbolized her feelings , whatever they were , by urging the machine faster and faster until scattered woodlands went by them in one black blotch and heavy hills and valleys seemed to ripple under the wheels like mere waves . A little while afterwards this mood seemed to slacken and she fell into a more ordinary pace ; but still she did not speak .
chesterton#Turnbull , who kept a more common and sensible view of the case than anyone else , made some remark about the moonlight ; but something indescribable made him also relapse into silence . All this time MacIan had been in a sort of monstrous delirium , like some fabulous hero snatched up into the moon . The difference between this experience and common experiences was analogous to that between waking life and a dream . Yet he did not feel in the least as if he were dreaming ; rather the other way ; as waking was more actual than dreaming , so this seemed by another degree more actual than waking itself . But it was another life altogether , like a cosmos with a new dimension . He felt he had been hurled into some new incarnation : into the midst of new relations , wrongs and rights , with towering responsibilities and almost tragic joys which he had as yet had no time to examine .
chesterton#Heaven had not merely sent him a message ; Heaven itself had opened around him and given him an hour of its own ancient and star - shattering energy . He had never felt so much alive before ; and yet he was like a man in a trance . And if you had asked him on what his throbbing happiness hung , he could only have told you that it hung on four or five visible facts , as a curtain hangs on four of five fixed nails . The fact that the lady had a little fur at her throat ; the fact that the curve of her cheek was a low and lean curve and that the moonlight caught the height of her cheek - bone ; the fact that her hands were small but heavily gloved as they gripped the steering - wheel ; the fact that a white witch light was on the road ; the fact that the brisk breeze of their passage stirred and fluttered a little not only the brown hair of her head but the black fur on her cap . All these facts were to him certain and incredible , like sacraments . When they had driven half a mile farther , a big shadow was flung across the path , followed by its bulky owner , who eyed the car critically but let it pass .
chesterton#"The silver moonlight picked out a piece or two of pewter ornament on his blue uniform ; and as they went by they knew it was a sergeant of police . Three hundred yards farther on another policeman stepped out into the road as if to stop them , then seemed to doubt his own authority and stepped back again . The girl was a daughter of the rich ; and this police suspicion ( under which all the poor live day and night ) stung her for the first time into speech . "" What can they mean ?"" she cried out in a kind of temper ; "" this car ' s going like a snail ."" There was a short silence , and then Turnbull said : "" It is certainly very odd , you are driving quietly enough ."""
chesterton#""" You are driving nobly ,"" said MacIan , and his words ( which had no meaning whatever ) sounded hoarse and ungainly even in his own ears . They passed the next mile and a half swiftly and smoothly ; yet among the many things which they passed in the course of it was a clump of eager policemen standing at a cross - road . As they passed , one of the policemen shouted something to the others ; but nothing else happened . Eight hundred yards farther on , Turnbull stood up suddenly in the swaying car . "" My God , MacIan !"" he called out , showing his first emotion of that night ."
chesterton#""" I don ' t believe it ' s the pace ; it couldn ' t be the pace . I believe it ' s us ."" MacIan sat motionless for a few moments and then turned up at his companion a face that was as white as the moon above it . "" You may be right ,"" he said at last ; "" if you are , I must tell her ."" "" I will tell the lady if you like ,"" said Turnbull , with his unconquered good temper . "" You !"""
chesterton#"said MacIan , with a sort of sincere and instinctive astonishment . "" Why should you -- no , I must tell her , of course ----"" And he leant forward and spoke to the lady in the fur cap . "" I am afraid , madam , that we may have got you into some trouble ,"" he said , and even as he said it it sounded wrong , like everything he said to this particular person in the long gloves . "" The fact is ,"" he resumed , desperately , "" the fact is , we are being chased by the police ."" Then the last flattening hammer fell upon poor Evan ' s embarrassment ; for the fluffy brown head with the furry black cap did not turn by a section of the compass ."
chesterton#""" We are chased by the police ,"" repeated MacIan , vigorously ; then he added , as if beginning an explanation , "" You see , I am a Catholic ."" The wind whipped back a curl of the brown hair so as to necessitate a new theory of aesthetics touching the line of the cheek - bone ; but the head did not turn . "" You see ,"" began MacIan , again blunderingly , "" this gentleman wrote in his newspaper that Our Lady was a common woman , a bad woman , and so we agreed to fight ; and we were fighting quite a little time ago -- but that was before we saw you ."" The young lady driving her car had half turned her face to listen ; and it was not a reverent or a patient face that she showed him . Her Norman nose was tilted a trifle too high upon the slim stalk of her neck and body . When MacIan saw that arrogant and uplifted profile pencilled plainly against the moonshine , he accepted an ultimate defeat ."
chesterton#"He had expected the angels to despise him if he were wrong , but not to despise him so much as this . "" You see ,"" said the stumbling spokesman , "" I was angry with him when he insulted the Mother of God , and I asked him to fight a duel with me ; but the police are all trying to stop it ."" Nothing seemed to waver or flicker in the fair young falcon profile ; and it only opened its lips to say , after a silence : "" I thought people in our time were supposed to respect each other ' s religion ."" Under the shadow of that arrogant face MacIan could only fall back on the obvious answer : "" But what about a man ' s irreligion ?"" The face only answered : "" Well , you ought to be more broadminded ."" If anyone else in the world had said the words , MacIan would have snorted with his equine neigh of scorn ."
chesterton#"But in this case he seemed knocked down by a superior simplicity , as if his eccentric attitude were rebuked by the innocence of a child . He could not dissociate anything that this woman said or did or wore from an idea of spiritual rarity and virtue . Like most others under the same elemental passion , his soul was at present soaked in ethics . He could have applied moral terms to the material objects of her environment . If someone had spoken of "" her generous ribbon "" or "" her chivalrous gloves "" or "" her merciful shoe - buckle ,"" it would not have seemed to him nonsense . He was silent , and the girl went on in a lower key as if she were momentarily softened and a little saddened also ."
chesterton#""" It won ' t do , you know ,"" she said ; "" you can ' t find out the truth in that way . There are such heaps of churches and people thinking different things nowadays , and they all think they are right . My uncle was a Swedenborgian ."" MacIan sat with bowed head , listening hungrily to her voice but hardly to her words , and seeing his great world drama grow smaller and smaller before his eyes till it was no bigger than a child ' s toy theatre . "" The time ' s gone by for all that ,"" she went on ; "" you can ' t find out the real thing like that -- if there is really anything to find ----"" and she sighed rather drearily ; for , like many of the women of our wealthy class , she was old and broken in thought , though young and clean enough in her emotions . "" Our object ,"" said Turnbull , shortly , "" is to make an effective demonstration ""; and after that word , MacIan looked at his vision again and found it smaller than ever ."
chesterton#""" It would be in the newspapers , of course ,"" said the girl . "" People read the newspapers , but they don ' t believe them , or anything else , I think ."" And she sighed again . She drove in silence a third of a mile before she added , as if completing the sentence : "" Anyhow , the whole thing ' s quite absurd ."" "" I don ' t think ,"" began Turnbull , "" that you quite realize ---- Hullo ! hullo -- hullo -- what ' s this ?"""
chesterton#"The amateur chauffeur had been forced to bring the car to a staggering stoppage , for a file of fat , blue policemen made a wall across the way . A sergeant came to the side and touched his peaked cap to the lady . "" Beg your pardon , miss ,"" he said with some embarrassment , for he knew her for a daughter of a dominant house , "" but we have reason to believe that the gentlemen in your car are ----"" and he hesitated for a polite phrase . "" I am Evan MacIan ,"" said that gentleman , and stood up in a sort of gloomy pomp , not wholly without a touch of the sulks of a schoolboy . "" Yes , we will get out , sergeant ,"" said Turnbull , more easily ; "" my name is James Turnbull . We must not incommode the lady ."""
chesterton#""" What are you taking them up for ?"" asked the young woman , looking straight in front of her along the road . "" It ' s under the new act ,"" said the sergeant , almost apologetically . "" Incurable disturbers of the peace ."" "" What will happen to them ?"" she asked , with the same frigid clearness ."
chesterton#""" Westgate Adult Reformatory ,"" he replied , briefly . "" Until when ?"" "" Until they are cured ,"" said the official . "" Very well , sergeant ,"" said the young lady , with a sort of tired common sense . "" I am sure I don ' t want to protect criminals or go against the law ; but I must tell you that these gentlemen have done me a considerable service ; you won ' t mind drawing your men a little farther off while I say good night to them . Men like that always misunderstand ."""
chesterton#The sergeant was profoundly disquieted from the beginning at the mere idea of arresting anyone in the company of a great lady ; to refuse one of her minor requests was quite beyond his courage . The police fell back to a few yards behind the car . Turnbull took up the two swords that were their only luggage ; the swords that , after so many half duels , they were now to surrender at last . MacIan , the blood thundering in his brain at the thought of that instant of farewell , bent over , fumbled at the handle and flung open the door to get out . But he did not get out . He did not get out , because it is dangerous to jump out of a car when it is going at full speed .
chesterton#And the car was going at full speed , because the young lady , without turning her head or so much as saying a syllable , had driven down a handle that made the machine plunge forward like a buffalo and then fly over the landscape like a greyhound . The police made one rush to follow , and then dropped so grotesque and hopeless a chase . Away in the vanishing distance they could see the sergeant furiously making notes . The open door , still left loose on its hinges , swung and banged quite crazily as they went whizzing up one road and down another . Nor did MacIan sit down ; he stood up stunned and yet staring , as he would have stood up at the trumpet of the Last Day . A black dot in the distance sprang up a tall black forest , swallowed them and spat them out again at the other end .
chesterton#A railway bridge grew larger and larger till it leapt upon their backs bellowing , and was in its turn left behind . Avenues of poplars on both sides of the road chased each other like the figures in a zoetrope . Now and then with a shock and rattle they went through sleeping moonlit villages , which must have stirred an instant in their sleep as at the passing of a fugitive earthquake . Sometimes in an outlying house a light in one erratic , unexpected window would give them a nameless hint of the hundred human secrets which they left behind them with their dust . Sometimes even a slouching rustic would be afoot on the road and would look after them , as after a flying phantom . But still MacIan stood up staring at earth and heaven ; and still the door he had flung open flapped loose like a flag .
chesterton#Turnbull , after a few minutes of dumb amazement , had yielded to the healthiest element in his nature and gone off into uncontrollable fits of laughter . The girl had not stirred an inch . After another half mile that seemed a mere flash , Turnbull leant over and locked the door . Evan staggered at last into his seat and hid his throbbing head in his hands ; and still the car flew on and its driver sat inflexible and silent . The moon had already gone down , and the whole darkness was faintly troubled with twilight and the first movement of beasts and fowls . It was that mysterious moment when light is coming as if it were something unknown whose nature one could not guess -- a mere alteration in everything .
chesterton#They looked at the sky and it seemed as dark as ever ; then they saw the black shape of a tower or tree against it and knew that it was already grey . Save that they were driving southward and had certainly passed the longitude of London , they knew nothing of their direction ; but Turnbull , who had spent a year on the Hampshire coast in his youth , began to recognize the unmistakable but quite indescribable villages of the English south . Then a white witch fire began to burn between the black stems of the fir - trees ; and , like so many things in nature , though not in books on evolution , the daybreak , when it did come , came much quicker than one would think . The gloomy heavens were ripped up and rolled away like a scroll , revealing splendours , as the car went roaring up the curve of a great hill ; and above them and black against the broadening light , there stood one of those crouching and fantastic trees that are first signals of the sea . X . THE SWORDS REJOINED
chesterton#As they came over the hill and down on the other side of it , it is not too much to say that the whole universe of God opened over them and under them , like a thing unfolding to five times its size . Almost under their feet opened the enormous sea , at the bottom of a steep valley which fell down into a bay ; and the sea under their feet blazed at them almost as lustrous and almost as empty as the sky . The sunrise opened above them like some cosmic explosion , shining and shattering and yet silent ; as if the world were blown to pieces without a sound . Round the rays of the victorious sun swept a sort of rainbow of confused and conquered colours -- brown and blue and green and flaming rose - colour ; as though gold were driving before it all the colours of the world . The lines of the landscape down which they sped , were the simple , strict , yet swerving , lines of a rushing river ; so that it was almost as if they were being sucked down in a huge still whirlpool . Turnbull had some such feeling , for he spoke for the first time for many hours .
chesterton#""" If we go down at this rate we shall be over the sea cliff ,"" he said . "" How glorious !"" said MacIan . When , however , they had come into the wide hollow at the bottom of that landslide , the car took a calm and graceful curve along the side of the sea , melted into the fringe of a few trees , and quietly , yet astonishingly , stopped . A belated light was burning in the broad morning in the window of a sort of lodge - or gate - keepers ' cottage ; and the girl stood up in the car and turned her splendid face to the sun . Evan seemed startled by the stillness , like one who had been born amid sound and speed ."
chesterton#"He wavered on his long legs as he stood up ; he pulled himself together , and the only consequence was that he trembled from head to foot . Turnbull had already opened the door on his side and jumped out . The moment he had done so the strange young woman had one more mad movement , and deliberately drove the car a few yards farther . Then she got out with an almost cruel coolness and began pulling off her long gloves and almost whistling . "" You can leave me here ,"" she said , quite casually , as if they had met five minutes before . "" That is the lodge of my father ' s place ."
chesterton#"Please come in , if you like -- but I understood that you had some business ."" Evan looked at that lifted face and found it merely lovely ; he was far too much of a fool to see that it was working with a final fatigue and that its austerity was agony . He was even fool enough to ask it a question . "" Why did you save us ?"" he said , quite humbly . The girl tore off one of her gloves , as if she were tearing off her hand ."
chesterton#""" Oh , I don ' t know ,"" she said , bitterly . "" Now I come to think of it , I can ' t imagine ."" Evan ' s thoughts , that had been piled up to the morning star , abruptly let him down with a crash into the very cellars of the emotional universe . He remained in a stunned silence for a long time ; and that , if he had only known , was the wisest thing that he could possibly do at the moment . Indeed , the silence and the sunrise had their healing effect , for when the extraordinary lady spoke again , her tone was more friendly and apologetic . "" I ' m not really ungrateful ,"" she said ; "" it was very good of you to save me from those men ."""
chesterton#""" But why ?"" repeated the obstinate and dazed MacIan , "" why did you save us from the other men ? I mean the policemen ?"" The girl ' s great brown eyes were lit up with a flash that was at once final desperation and the loosening of some private and passionate reserve . "" Oh , God knows !"" she cried ."
chesterton#""" God knows that if there is a God He has turned His big back on everything . God knows I have had no pleasure in my life , though I am pretty and young and father has plenty of money . And then people come and tell me that I ought to do things and I do them and it ' s all drivel . They want you to do work among the poor ; which means reading Ruskin and feeling self - righteous in the best room in a poor tenement . Or to help some cause or other , which always means bundling people out of crooked houses , in which they ' ve always lived , into straight houses , in which they often die . And all the time you have inside only the horrid irony of your own empty head and empty heart ."
chesterton#"I am to give to the unfortunate , when my whole misfortune is that I have nothing to give . I am to teach , when I believe nothing at all that I was taught . I am to save the children from death , and I am not even certain that I should not be better dead . I suppose if I actually saw a child drowning I should save it . But that would be from the same motive from which I have saved you , or destroyed you , whichever it is that I have done ."" "" What was the motive ?"""
chesterton#"asked Evan , in a low voice . "" My motive is too big for my mind ,"" answered the girl . Then , after a pause , as she stared with a rising colour at the glittering sea , she said : "" It can ' t be described , and yet I am trying to describe it . It seems to me not only that I am unhappy , but that there is no way of being happy . Father is not happy , though he is a Member of Parliament ----"" She paused a moment and added with a ghost of a smile : "" Nor Aunt Mabel , though a man from India has told her the secret of all creeds . But I may be wrong ; there may be a way out ."
chesterton#"And for one stark , insane second , I felt that , after all , you had got the way out and that was why the world hated you . You see , if there were a way out , it would be sure to be something that looked very queer ."" Evan put his hand to his forehead and began stumblingly : "" Yes , I suppose we do seem ----"" "" Oh , yes , you look queer enough ,"" she said , with ringing sincerity . "" You ' ll be all the better for a wash and brush up ."" "" You forget our business , madam ,"" said Evan , in a shaking voice ; "" we have no concern but to kill each other ."""
chesterton#""" Well , I shouldn ' t be killed looking like that if I were you ,"" she replied , with inhuman honesty . Evan stood and rolled his eyes in masculine bewilderment . Then came the final change in this Proteus , and she put out both her hands for an instant and said in a low tone on which he lived for days and nights : "" Don ' t you understand that I did not dare to stop you ? What you are doing is so mad that it may be quite true . Somehow one can never really manage to be an atheist ."""
chesterton#Turnbull stood staring at the sea ; but his shoulders showed that he heard , and after one minute he turned his head . But the girl had only brushed Evan ' s hand with hers and had fled up the dark alley by the lodge gate . Evan stood rooted upon the road , literally like some heavy statue hewn there in the age of the Druids . It seemed impossible that he should ever move . Turnbull grew restless with this rigidity , and at last , after calling his companion twice or thrice , went up and clapped him impatiently on one of his big shoulders . Evan winced and leapt away from him with a repulsion which was not the hate of an unclean thing nor the dread of a dangerous one , but was a spasm of awe and separation from something from which he was now sundered as by the sword of God .
chesterton#"He did not hate the atheist ; it is possible that he loved him . But Turnbull was now something more dreadful than an enemy : he was a thing sealed and devoted -- a thing now hopelessly doomed to be either a corpse or an executioner . "" What is the matter with you ?"" asked Turnbull , with his hearty hand still in the air ; and yet he knew more about it than his innocent action would allow . "" James ,"" said Evan , speaking like one under strong bodily pain , "" I asked for God ' s answer and I have got it -- got it in my vitals . He knows how weak I am , and that I might forget the peril of the faith , forget the face of Our Lady -- yes , even with your blow upon her cheek ."
chesterton#"But the honour of this earth has just this about it , that it can make a man ' s heart like iron . I am from the Lords of the Isles and I dare not be a mere deserter . Therefore , God has tied me by the chain of my worldly place and word , and there is nothing but fighting now ."" "" I think I understand you ,"" said Turnbull , "" but you say everything tail foremost ."" "" She wants us to do it ,"" said Evan , in a voice crushed with passion . "" She has hurt herself so that we might do it ."
chesterton#"She has left her good name and her good sleep and all her habits and dignity flung away on the other side of England in the hope that she may hear of us and that we have broken some hole into heaven ."" "" I thought I knew what you mean ,"" said Turnbull , biting his beard ; "" it does seem as if we ought to do something after all she has done this night ."" "" I never liked you so much before ,"" said MacIan , in bitter sorrow . As he spoke , three solemn footmen came out of the lodge gate and assembled to assist the chauffeur to his room . The mere sight of them made the two wanderers flee as from a too frightful incongruity , and before they knew where they were , they were well upon the grassy ledge of England that overlooks the Channel . Evan said suddenly : "" Will they let me see her in heaven once in a thousand ages ?"""
chesterton#"and addressed the remark to the editor of _The Atheist_ , as on which he would be likely or qualified to answer . But no answer came ; a silence sank between the two . Turnbull strode sturdily to the edge of the cliff and looked out , his companion following , somewhat more shaken by his recent agitation . "" If that ' s the view you take ,"" said Turnbull , "" and I don ' t say you are wrong , I think I know where we shall be best off for the business . As it happens , I know this part of the south coast pretty well . And unless I am mistaken there ' s a way down the cliff just here which will land us on a stretch of firm sand where no one is likely to follow us ."""
chesterton#The Highlander made a gesture of assent and came also almost to the edge of the precipice . The sunrise , which was broadening over sea and shore , was one of those rare and splendid ones in which there seems to be no mist or doubt , and nothing but a universal clarification more and more complete . All the colours were transparent . It seemed like a triumphant prophecy of some perfect world where everything being innocent will be intelligible ; a world where even our bodies , so to speak , may be as of burning glass . Such a world is faintly though fiercely figured in the coloured windows of Christian architecture . The sea that lay before them was like a pavement of emerald , bright and almost brittle ; the sky against which its strict horizon hung was almost absolutely white , except that close to the sky line , like scarlet braids on the hem of a garment , lay strings of flaky cloud of so gleaming and gorgeous a red that they seemed cut out of some strange blood - red celestial metal , of which the mere gold of this earth is but a drab yellow imitation .
chesterton#""" The hand of Heaven is still pointing ,"" muttered the man of superstition to himself . "" And now it is a blood - red hand ."" The cool voice of his companion cut in upon his monologue , calling to him from a little farther along the cliff , to tell him that he had found the ladder of descent . It began as a steep and somewhat greasy path , which then tumbled down twenty or thirty feet in the form of a fall of rough stone steps . After that , there was a rather awkward drop on to a ledge of stone and then the journey was undertaken easily and even elegantly by the remains of an ornamental staircase , such as might have belonged to some long - disused watering - place . All the time that the two travellers sank from stage to stage of this downward journey , there closed over their heads living bridges and caverns of the most varied foliage , all of which grew greener , redder , or more golden , in the growing sunlight of the morning ."
chesterton#Life , too , of the more moving sort rose at the sun on every side of them . Birds whirred and fluttered in the undergrowth , as if imprisoned in green cages . Other birds were shaken up in great clouds from the tree - tops , as if they were blossoms detached and scattered up to heaven . Animals which Turnbull was too much of a Londoner and MacIan too much of a Northerner to know , slipped by among the tangle or ran pattering up the tree - trunks . Both the men , according to their several creeds , felt the full thunder of the psalm of life as they had never heard it before ; MacIan felt God the Father , benignant in all His energies , and Turnbull that ultimate anonymous energy , that _Natura Naturans_ , which is the whole theme of Lucretius . It was down this clamorous ladder of life that they went down to die .
chesterton#"They broke out upon a brown semicircle of sand , so free from human imprint as to justify Turnbull ' s profession . They strode out upon it , stuck their swords in the sand , and had a pause too important for speech . Turnbull eyed the coast curiously for a moment , like one awakening memories of childhood ; then he said abruptly , like a man remembering somebody ' s name : "" But , of course , we shall be better off still round the corner of Cragness Point ; nobody ever comes there at all ."" And picking up his sword again , he began striding towards a big bluff of the rocks which stood out upon their left . MacIan followed him round the corner and found himself in what was certainly an even finer fencing court , of flat , firm sand , enclosed on three sides by white walls of rock , and on the fourth by the green wall of the advancing sea . "" We are quite safe here ,"" said Turnbull , and , to the other ' s surprise , flung himself down , sitting on the brown beach ."
chesterton#""" You see , I was brought up near here ,"" he explained . "" I was sent from Scotland to stop with my aunt . It is highly probable that I may die here . Do you mind if I light a pipe ?"" "" Of course , do whatever you like ,"" said MacIan , with a choking voice , and he went and walked alone by himself along the wet , glistening sands . Ten minutes afterwards he came back again , white with his own whirlwind of emotions ; Turnbull was quite cheerful and was knocking out the end of his pipe ."
chesterton#""" You see , we have to do it ,"" said MacIan . "" She tied us to it ."" "" Of course , my dear fellow ,"" said the other , and leapt up as lightly as a monkey . They took their places gravely in the very centre of the great square of sand , as if they had thousands of spectators . Before saluting , MacIan , who , being a mystic , was one inch nearer to Nature , cast his eye round the huge framework of their heroic folly . The three walls of rock all leant a little outward , though at various angles ; but this impression was exaggerated in the direction of the incredible by the heavy load of living trees and thickets which each wall wore on its top like a huge shock of hair ."
chesterton#On all that luxurious crest of life the risen and victorious sun was beating , burnishing it all like gold , and every bird that rose with that sunrise caught a light like a star upon it like the dove of the Holy Spirit . Imaginative life had never so much crowded upon MacIan . He felt that he could write whole books about the feelings of a single bird . He felt that for two centuries he would not tire of being a rabbit . He was in the Palace of Life , of which the very tapestries and curtains were alive . Then he recovered himself , and remembered his affairs .
chesterton#"Both men saluted , and iron rang upon iron . It was exactly at the same moment that he realized that his enemy ' s left ankle was encircled with a ring of salt water that had crept up to his feet . "" What is the matter ?"" said Turnbull , stopping an instant , for he had grown used to every movement of his extraordinary fellow - traveller ' s face . MacIan glanced again at that silver anklet of sea - water and then looked beyond at the next promontory round which a deep sea was boiling and leaping . Then he turned and looked back and saw heavy foam being shaken up to heaven about the base of Cragness Point ."
chesterton#""" The sea has cut us off ,"" he said , curtly . "" I have noticed it ,"" said Turnbull with equal sobriety . "" What view do you take of the development ?"" Evan threw away his weapon , and , as his custom was , imprisoned his big head in his hands . Then he let them fall and said : "" Yes , I know what it means ; and I think it is the fairest thing . It is the finger of God -- red as blood -- still pointing ."
chesterton#"But now it points to two graves ."" There was a space filled with the sound of the sea , and then MacIan spoke again in a voice pathetically reasonable : "" You see , we both saved her -- and she told us both to fight -- and it would not be just that either should fail and fall alone , while the other ----"" "" You mean ,"" said Turnbull , in a voice surprisingly soft and gentle , "" that there is something fine about fighting in a place where even the conqueror must die ?"" "" Oh , you have got it right , you have got it right !"" cried out Evan , in an extraordinary childish ecstasy . "" Oh , I ' m sure that you really believe in God !"""
chesterton#Turnbull answered not a word , but only took up his fallen sword . For the third time Evan MacIan looked at those three sides of English cliff hung with their noisy load of life . He had been at a loss to understand the almost ironical magnificence of all those teeming creatures and tropical colours and smells that smoked happily to heaven . But now he knew that he was in the closed court of death and that all the gates were sealed . He drank in the last green and the last red and the last gold , those unique and indescribable things of God , as a man drains good wine at the bottom of his glass . Then he turned and saluted his enemy once more , and the two stood up and fought till the foam flowed over their knees .
chesterton#"Then MacIan stepped backward suddenly with a splash and held up his hand . "" Turnbull !"" he cried ; "" I can ' t help it -- fair fighting is more even than promises . And this is not fair fighting ."" "" What the deuce do you mean ?"" asked the other , staring ."
chesterton#""" I ' ve only just thought of it ,"" cried Evan , brokenly . "" We ' re very well matched -- it may go on a good time -- the tide is coming up fast -- and I ' m a foot and a half taller . You ' ll be washed away like seaweed before it ' s above my breeches . I ' ll not fight foul for all the girls and angels in the universe ."" "" Will you oblige me ,"" said Turnbull , with staring grey eyes and a voice of distinct and violent politeness ; "" will you oblige me by jolly well minding your own business ? Just you stand up and fight , and we ' ll see who will be washed away like seaweed ."
chesterton#"You wanted to finish this fight and you shall finish it , or I ' ll denounce you as a coward to the whole of that assembled company ."" Evan looked very doubtful and offered a somewhat wavering weapon ; but he was quickly brought back to his senses by his opponent ' s sword - point , which shot past him , shaving his shoulder by a hair . By this time the waves were well up Turnbull ' s thigh , and what was worse , they were beginning to roll and break heavily around them . MacIan parried this first lunge perfectly , the next less perfectly ; the third in all human probability he would not have parried at all ; the Christian champion would have been pinned like a butterfly , and the atheistic champion left to drown like a rat , with such consolation as his view of the cosmos afforded him . But just as Turnbull launched his heaviest stroke , the sea , in which he stood up to his hips , launched a yet heavier one . A wave breaking beyond the others smote him heavily like a hammer of water ."
chesterton#One leg gave way , he was swung round and sucked into the retreating sea , still gripping his sword . MacIan put his sword between his teeth and plunged after his disappearing enemy . He had the sense of having the whole universe on top of him as crest after crest struck him down . It seemed to him quite a cosmic collapse , as if all the seven heavens were falling on him one after the other . But he got hold of the atheist ' s left leg and he did not let it go . After some ten minutes of foam and frenzy , in which all the senses at once seemed blasted by the sea , Evan found himself laboriously swimming on a low , green swell , with the sword still in his teeth and the editor of _The Atheist_ still under his arm .
chesterton#What he was going to do he had not even the most glimmering idea ; so he merely kept his grip and swam somehow with one hand . He ducked instinctively as there bulked above him a big , black wave , much higher than any that he had seen . Then he saw that it was hardly the shape of any possible wave . Then he saw that it was a fisherman ' s boat , and , leaping upward , caught hold of the bow . The boat pitched forward with its stern in the air for just as much time as was needed to see that there was nobody in it . After a moment or two of desperate clambering , however , there were two people in it , Mr . Evan MacIan , panting and sweating , and Mr . James Turnbull , uncommonly close to being drowned .
chesterton#After ten minutes ' aimless tossing in the empty fishing - boat he recovered , however , stirred , stretched himself , and looked round on the rolling waters . Then , while taking no notice of the streams of salt water that were pouring from his hair , beard , coat , boots , and trousers , he carefully wiped the wet off his sword - blade to preserve it from the possibilities of rust . MacIan found two oars in the bottom of the deserted boat and began somewhat drearily to row . * * * A rainy twilight was clearing to cold silver over the moaning sea , when the battered boat that had rolled and drifted almost aimlessly all night , came within sight of land , though of land which looked almost as lost and savage as the waves . All night there had been but little lifting in the leaden sea , only now and then the boat had been heaved up , as on a huge shoulder which slipped from under it ; such occasional sea - quakes came probably from the swell of some steamer that had passed it in the dark ; otherwise the waves were harmless though restless .
chesterton#But it was piercingly cold , and there was , from time to time , a splutter of rain like the splutter of the spray , which seemed almost to freeze as it fell . MacIan , more at home than his companion in this quite barbarous and elemental sort of adventure , had rowed toilsomely with the heavy oars whenever he saw anything that looked like land ; but for the most part had trusted with grim transcendentalism to wind and tide . Among the implements of their first outfit the brandy alone had remained to him , and he gave it to his freezing companion in quantities which greatly alarmed that temperate Londoner ; but MacIan came from the cold seas and mists where a man can drink a tumbler of raw whisky in a boat without it making him wink . When the Highlander began to pull really hard upon the oars , Turnbull craned his dripping red head out of the boat to see the goal of his exertions . It was a sufficiently uninviting one ; nothing so far as could be seen but a steep and shelving bank of shingle , made of loose little pebbles such as children like , but slanting up higher than a house . On the top of the mound , against the sky line , stood up the brown skeleton of some broken fence or breakwater .
chesterton#With the grey and watery dawn crawling up behind it , the fence really seemed to say to our philosophic adventurers that they had come at last to the other end of nowhere . Bent by necessity to his labour , MacIan managed the heavy boat with real power and skill , and when at length he ran it up on a smoother part of the slope it caught and held so that they could clamber out , not sinking farther than their knees into the water and the shingle . A foot or two farther up their feet found the beach firmer , and a few moments afterwards they were leaning on the ragged breakwater and looking back at the sea they had escaped . They had a dreary walk across wastes of grey shingle in the grey dawn before they began to come within hail of human fields or roads ; nor had they any notion of what fields or roads they would be . Their boots were beginning to break up and the confusion of stones tried them severely , so that they were glad to lean on their swords , as if they were the staves of pilgrims . MacIan thought vaguely of a weird ballad of his own country which describes the soul in Purgatory as walking on a plain full of sharp stones , and only saved by its own charities upon earth .
chesterton#If ever thou gavest hosen and shoon Every night and all , Sit thee down and put them on , And Christ receive thy soul . Turnbull had no such lyrical meditations , but he was in an even worse temper . At length they came to a pale ribbon of road , edged by a shelf of rough and almost colourless turf ; and a few feet up the slope there stood grey and weather - stained , one of those big wayside crucifixes which are seldom seen except in Catholic countries . MacIan put his hand to his head and found that his bonnet was not there . Turnbull gave one glance at the crucifix -- a glance at once sympathetic and bitter , in which was concentrated the whole of Swinburne ' s poem on the same occasion . O hidden face of man , whereover The years have woven a viewless veil , If thou wert verily man ' s lover What did thy love or blood avail ?
chesterton#"Thy blood the priests mix poison of , And in gold shekels coin thy love . Then , leaving MacIan in his attitude of prayer , Turnbull began to look right and left very sharply , like one looking for something . Suddenly , with a little cry , he saw it and ran forward . A few yards from them along the road a lean and starved sort of hedge came pitifully to an end . Caught upon its prickly angle , however , there was a very small and very dirty scrap of paper that might have hung there for months , since it escaped from someone tearing up a letter or making a spill out of a newspaper . Turnbull snatched at it and found it was the corner of a printed page , very coarsely printed , like a cheap novelette , and just large enough to contain the words : "" _et c ' est elle qui_ ----"""
chesterton#""" Hurrah !"" cried Turnbull , waving his fragment ; "" we are safe at last . We are free at last . We are somewhere better than England or Eden or Paradise . MacIan , we are in the Land of the Duel !"" "" Where do you say ?"""
chesterton#"said the other , looking at him heavily and with knitted brows , like one almost dazed with the grey doubts of desolate twilight and drifting sea . "" We are in France !"" cried Turnbull , with a voice like a trumpet , "" in the land where things really happen -- _Tout arrive en France_ . We arrive in France . Look at this little message ,"" and he held out the scrap of paper . "" There ' s an omen for you superstitious hill folk ."
chesterton#"_C ' est elle qui -- Mais oui , mais oui , c ' est elle qui sauvera encore le monde_ ."" "" France !"" repeated MacIan , and his eyes awoke again in his head like large lamps lighted . "" Yes , France !"" said Turnbull , and all the rhetorical part of him came to the top , his face growing as red as his hair . "" France , that has always been in rebellion for liberty and reason ."
chesterton#"France , that has always assailed superstition with the club of Rabelais or the rapier of Voltaire . France , at whose first council table sits the sublime figure of Julian the Apostate . France , where a man said only the other day those splendid unanswerable words ""-- with a superb gesture --""' we have extinguished in heaven those lights that men shall never light again .'"" "" No ,"" said MacIan , in a voice that shook with a controlled passion . "" But France , which was taught by St . Bernard and led to war by Joan of Arc . France that made the crusades ."
chesterton#"France that saved the Church and scattered the heresies by the mouths of Bossuet and Massillon . France , which shows today the conquering march of Catholicism , as brain after brain surrenders to it , Brunetire , Coppe , Hauptmann , Barrs , Bourget , Lematre ."" "" France !"" asserted Turnbull with a sort of rollicking self - exaggeration , very unusual with him , "" France , which is one torrent of splendid scepticism from Abelard to Anatole France ."" "" France ,"" said MacIan , "" which is one cataract of clear faith from St . Louis to Our Lady of Lourdes ."" "" France at least ,"" cried Turnbull , throwing up his sword in schoolboy triumph , "" in which these things are thought about and fought about ."
chesterton#"France , where reason and religion clash in one continual tournament . France , above all , where men understand the pride and passion which have plucked our blades from their scabbards . Here , at least , we shall not be chased and spied on by sickly parsons and greasy policemen , because we wish to put our lives on the game . Courage , my friend , we have come to the country of honour ."" MacIan did not even notice the incongruous phrase "" my friend "", but nodding again and again , drew his sword and flung the scabbard far behind him in the road . "" Yes ,"" he cried , in a voice of thunder , "" we will fight here and _He_ shall look on at it ."""
chesterton#"Turnbull glanced at the crucifix with a sort of scowling good - humour and then said : "" He may look and see His cross defeated ."" "" The cross cannot be defeated ,"" said MacIan , "" for it is Defeat ."" A second afterwards the two bright , blood - thirsty weapons made the sign of the cross in horrible parody upon each other . They had not touched each other twice , however , when upon the hill , above the crucifix , there appeared another horrible parody of its shape ; the figure of a man who appeared for an instant waving his outspread arms . He had vanished in an instant ; but MacIan , whose fighting face was set that way , had seen the shape momentarily but quite photographically . And while it was like a comic repetition of the cross , it was also , in that place and hour , something more incredible ."
chesterton#It had been only instantaneously on the retina of his eye ; but unless his eye and mind were going mad together , the figure was that of an ordinary London policeman . He tried to concentrate his senses on the sword - play ; but one half of his brain was wrestling with the puzzle ; the apocalyptic and almost seraphic apparition of a stout constable out of Clapham on top of a dreary and deserted hill in France . He did not , however , have to puzzle long . Before the duellists had exchanged half a dozen passes , the big , blue policeman appeared once more on the top of the hill , a palpable monstrosity in the eye of heaven . He was waving only one arm now and seemed to be shouting directions . At the same moment a mass of blue blocked the corner of the road behind the small , smart figure of Turnbull , and a small company of policemen in the English uniform came up at a kind of half - military double .
chesterton#"Turnbull saw the stare of consternation in his enemy ' s face and swung round to share its cause . When he saw it , cool as he was , he staggered back . "" What the devil are you doing here ?"" he called out in a high , shrill voice of authority , like one who finds a tramp in his own larder . "" Well , sir ,"" said the sergeant in command , with that sort of heavy civility shown only to the evidently guilty , "" seems to me we might ask what are you doing here ?"" "" We are having an affair of honour ,"" said Turnbull , as if it were the most rational thing in the world ."
chesterton#""" If the French police like to interfere , let them interfere . But why the blue blazes should you interfere , you great blue blundering sausages ?"" "" I ' m afraid , sir ,"" said the sergeant with restraint , "" I ' m afraid I don ' t quite follow you ."" "" I mean , why don ' t the French police take this up if it ' s got to be taken up ? I always heard that they were spry enough in their own way ."" "" Well , sir ,"" said the sergeant reflectively , "" you see , sir , the French police don ' t take this up -- well , because you see , sir , this ain ' t France ."
chesterton#"This is His Majesty ' s dominions , same as ' Ampstead ' eath ."" "" Not France ?"" repeated Turnbull , with a sort of dull incredulity . "" No , sir ,"" said the sergeant ; "" though most of the people talk French . This is the island called St . Loup , sir , an island in the Channel . We ' ve been sent down specially from London , as you were such specially distinguished criminals , if you ' ll allow me to say so ."
chesterton#"Which reminds me to warn you that anything you say may be used against you at your trial ."" "" Quite so ,"" said Turnbull , and lurched suddenly against the sergeant , so as to tip him over the edge of the road with a crash into the shingle below . Then leaving MacIan and the policemen equally and instantaneously nailed to the road , he ran a little way along it , leapt off on to a part of the beach , which he had found in his journey to be firmer , and went across it with a clatter of pebbles . His sudden calculation was successful ; the police , unacquainted with the various levels of the loose beach , tried to overtake him by the shorter cut and found themselves , being heavy men , almost up to their knees in shoals of slippery shingle . Two who had been slower with their bodies were quicker with their minds , and seeing Turnbull ' s trick , ran along the edge of the road after him . Then MacIan finally awoke , and leaving half his sleeve in the grip of the only man who tried to hold him , took the two policemen in the small of their backs with the impetus of a cannon - ball and , sending them also flat among the stones , went tearing after his twin defier of the law ."
chesterton#"As they were both good runners , the start they had gained was decisive . They dropped over a high breakwater farther on upon the beach , turned sharply , and scrambled up a line of ribbed rocks , crowned with a thicket , crawled through it , scratching their hands and faces , and dropped into another road ; and there found that they could slacken their speed into a steady trot . In all this desperate dart and scramble , they still kept hold of their drawn swords , which now , indeed , in the vigorous phrase of Bunyan , seemed almost to grow out of their hands . They had run another half mile or so when it became apparent that they were entering a sort of scattered village . One or two whitewashed cottages and even a shop had appeared along the side of the road . Then , for the first time , Turnbull twisted round his red bear to get a glimpse of his companion , who was a foot or two behind , and remarked abruptly : "" Mr . MacIan , we ' ve been going the wrong way to work all along ."
chesterton#"We ' re traced everywhere , because everybody knows about us . It ' s as if one went about with Kruger ' s beard on Mafeking Night ."" "" What do you mean ?"" said MacIan , innocently . "" I mean ,"" said Turnbull , with steady conviction , "" that what we want is a little diplomacy , and I am going to buy some in a shop ."" XI ."
chesterton#A SCANDAL IN THE VILLAGE In the little hamlet of Haroc , in the Isle of St . Loup , there lived a man who -- though living under the English flag -- was absolutely untypical of the French tradition . He was quite unnoticeable , but that was exactly where he was quite himself . He was not even extraordinarily French ; but then it is against the French tradition to be extraordinarily French . Ordinary Englishmen would only have thought him a little old - fashioned ; imperialistic Englishmen would really have mistaken him for the old John Bull of the caricatures . He was stout ; he was quite undistinguished ; and he had side - whiskers , worn just a little longer than John Bull ' s .
chesterton#He was by name Pierre Durand ; he was by trade a wine merchant ; he was by politics a conservative republican ; he had been brought up a Catholic , had always thought and acted as an agnostic , and was very mildly returning to the Church in his later years . He had a genius ( if one can even use so wild a word in connexion with so tame a person ) a genius for saying the conventional thing on every conceivable subject ; or rather what we in England would call the conventional thing . For it was not convention with him , but solid and manly conviction . Convention implies cant or affectation , and he had not the faintest smell of either . He was simply an ordinary citizen with ordinary views ; and if you had told him so he would have taken it as an ordinary compliment . If you had asked him about women , he would have said that one must preserve their domesticity and decorum ; he would have used the stalest words , but he would have in reserve the strongest arguments .
chesterton#If you had asked him about government , he would have said that all citizens were free and equal , but he would have meant what he said . If you had asked him about education , he would have said that the young must be trained up in habits of industry and of respect for their parents . Still he would have set them the example of industry , and he would have been one of the parents whom they could respect . A state of mind so hopelessly central is depressing to the English instinct . But then in England a man announcing these platitudes is generally a fool and a frightened fool , announcing them out of mere social servility . But Durand was anything but a fool ; he had read all the eighteenth century , and could have defended his platitudes round every angle of eighteenth - century argument .
chesterton#And certainly he was anything but a coward : swollen and sedentary as he was , he could have hit any man back who touched him with the instant violence of an automatic machine ; and dying in a uniform would have seemed to him only the sort of thing that sometimes happens . I am afraid it is impossible to explain this monster amid the exaggerative sects and the eccentric clubs of my country . He was merely a man . He lived in a little villa which was furnished well with comfortable chairs and tables and highly uncomfortable classical pictures and medallions . The art in his home contained nothing between the two extremes of hard , meagre designs of Greek heads and Roman togas , and on the other side a few very vulgar Catholic images in the crudest colours ; these were mostly in his daughter ' s room . He had recently lost his wife , whom he had loved heartily and rather heavily in complete silence , and upon whose grave he was constantly in the habit of placing hideous little wreaths , made out of a sort of black - and - white beads .
chesterton#To his only daughter he was equally devoted , though he restricted her a good deal under a sort of theoretic alarm about her innocence ; an alarm which was peculiarly unnecessary , first , because she was an exceptionally reticent and religious girl , and secondly , because there was hardly anybody else in the place . Madeleine Durand was physically a sleepy young woman , and might easily have been supposed to be morally a lazy one . It is , however , certain that the work of her house was done somehow , and it is even more rapidly ascertainable that nobody else did it . The logician is , therefore , driven back upon the assumption that she did it ; and that lends a sort of mysterious interest to her personality at the beginning . She had very broad , low , and level brows , which seemed even lower because her warm yellow hair clustered down to her eyebrows ; and she had a face just plump enough not to look as powerful as it was . Anything that was heavy in all this was abruptly lightened by two large , light china - blue eyes , lightened all of a sudden as if it had been lifted into the air by two big blue butterflies .
chesterton#The rest of her was less than middle - sized , and was of a casual and comfortable sort ; and she had this difference from such girls as the girl in the motor - car , that one did not incline to take in her figure at all , but only her broad and leonine and innocent head . Both the father and the daughter were of the sort that would normally have avoided all observation ; that is , all observation in that extraordinary modern world which calls out everything except strength . Both of them had strength below the surface ; they were like quiet peasants owning enormous and unquarried mines . The father with his square face and grey side whiskers , the daughter with her square face and golden fringe of hair , were both stronger than they know ; stronger than anyone knew . The father believed in civilization , in the storied tower we have erected to affront nature ; that is , the father believed in Man . The daughter believed in God ; and was even stronger .
chesterton#They neither of them believed in themselves ; for that is a decadent weakness . The daughter was called a devotee . She left upon ordinary people the impression -- the somewhat irritating impression -- produced by such a person ; it can only be described as the sense of strong water being perpetually poured into some abyss . She did her housework easily ; she achieved her social relations sweetly ; she was never neglectful and never unkind . This accounted for all that was soft in her , but not for all that was hard . She trod firmly as if going somewhere ; she flung her face back as if defying something ; she hardly spoke a cross word , yet there was often battle in her eyes .
chesterton#The modern man asked doubtfully where all this silent energy went to . He would have stared still more doubtfully if he had been told that it all went into her prayers . The conventions of the Isle of St . Loup were necessarily a compromise or confusion between those of France and England ; and it was vaguely possible for a respectable young lady to have half - attached lovers , in a way that would be impossible to the _bourgeoisie_ of France . One man in particular had made himself an unmistakable figure in the track of this girl as she went to church . He was a short , prosperous - looking man , whose long , bushy black beard and clumsy black umbrella made him seem both shorter and older than he really was ; but whose big , bold eyes , and step that spurned the ground , gave him an instant character of youth . His name was Camille Bert , and he was a commercial traveller who had only been in the island an idle week before he began to hover in the tracks of Madeleine Durand .
chesterton#Since everyone knows everyone in so small a place , Madeleine certainly knew him to speak to ; but it is not very evident that she ever spoke . He haunted her , however ; especially at church , which was , indeed , one of the few certain places for finding her . In her home she had a habit of being invisible , sometimes through insatiable domesticity , sometimes through an equally insatiable solitude . M . Bert did not give the impression of a pious man , though he did give , especially with his eyes , the impression of an honest one . But he went to Mass with a simple exactitude that could not be mistaken for a pose , or even for a vulgar fascination . It was perhaps this religious regularity which eventually drew Madeleine into recognition of him .
chesterton#At least it is certain that she twice spoke to him with her square and open smile in the porch of the church ; and there was human nature enough in the hamlet to turn even that into gossip . But the real interest arose suddenly as a squall arises with the extraordinary affair that occurred about five days after . There was about a third of a mile beyond the village of Haroc a large but lonely hotel upon the London or Paris model , but commonly almost entirely empty . Among the accidental group of guests who had come to it at this season was a man whose nationality no one could fix and who bore the non - committal name of Count Gregory . He treated everybody with complete civility and almost in complete silence . On the few occasions when he spoke , he spoke either French , English , or once ( to the priest ) Latin ; and the general opinion was that he spoke them all wrong .
chesterton#He was a large , lean man , with the stoop of an aged eagle , and even the eagle ' s nose to complete it ; he had old - fashioned military whiskers and moustache dyed with a garish and highly incredible yellow . He had the dress of a showy gentleman and the manners of a decayed gentleman ; he seemed ( as with a sort of simplicity ) to be trying to be a dandy when he was too old even to know that he was old . Ye he was decidedly a handsome figure with his curled yellow hair and lean fastidious face ; and he wore a peculiar frock - coat of bright turquoise blue , with an unknown order pinned to it , and he carried a huge and heavy cane . Despite his silence and his dandified dress and whiskers , the island might never have heard of him but for the extraordinary event of which I have spoken , which fell about in the following way : In such casual atmospheres only the enthusiastic go to Benediction ; and as the warm blue twilight closed over the little candle - lit church and village , the line of worshippers who went home from the former to the latter thinned out until it broke . On one such evening at least no one was in church except the quiet , unconquerable Madeleine , four old women , one fisherman , and , of course , the irrepressible M . Camille Bert .
chesterton#The others seemed to melt away afterwards into the peacock colours of the dim green grass and the dark blue sky . Even Durand was invisible instead of being merely reverentially remote ; and Madeleine set forth through the patch of black forest alone . She was not in the least afraid of loneliness , because she was not afraid of devils . I think they were afraid of her . In a clearing of the wood , however , which was lit up with a last patch of the perishing sunlight , there advanced upon her suddenly one who was more startling than a devil . The incomprehensible Count Gregory , with his yellow hair like flame and his face like the white ashes of the flame , was advancing bareheaded towards her , flinging out his arms and his long fingers with a frantic gesture .
chesterton#""" We are alone here ,"" he cried , "" and you would be at my mercy , only that I am at yours ."" Then his frantic hands fell by his sides and he looked up under his brows with an expression that went well with his hard breathing . Madeleine Durand had come to a halt at first in childish wonder , and now , with more than masculine self - control , "" I fancy I know your face , sir ,"" she said , as if to gain time . "" I know I shall not forget yours ,"" said the other , and extended once more his ungainly arms in an unnatural gesture . Then of a sudden there came out of him a spout of wild and yet pompous phrases . "" It is as well that you should know the worst and the best ."
chesterton#"I am a man who knows no limit ; I am the most callous of criminals , the most unrepentant of sinners . There is no man in my dominions so vile as I . But my dominions stretch from the olives of Italy to the fir - woods of Denmark , and there is no nook of all of them in which I have not done a sin . But when I bear you away I shall be doing my first sacrilege , and also my first act of virtue ."" He seized her suddenly by the elbow ; and she did not scream but only pulled and tugged . Yet though she had not screamed , someone astray in the woods seemed to have heard the struggle ."
chesterton#"A short but nimble figure came along the woodland path like a humming bullet and had caught Count Gregory a crack across the face before his own could be recognized . When it was recognized it was that of Camille , with the black elderly beard and the young ardent eyes . Up to the moment when Camille had hit the Count , Madeleine had entertained no doubt that the Count was merely a madman . Now she was startled with a new sanity ; for the tall man in the yellow whiskers and yellow moustache first returned the blow of Bert , as if it were a sort of duty , and then stepped back with a slight bow and an easy smile . "" This need go no further here , M . Bert ,"" he said . "" I need not remind you how far it should go elsewhere ."""
chesterton#""" Certainly , you need remind me of nothing ,"" answered Camille , stolidly . "" I am glad that you are just not too much of a scoundrel for a gentleman to fight ."" "" We are detaining the lady ,"" said Count Gregory , with politeness ; and , making a gesture suggesting that he would have taken off his hat if he had had one , he strode away up the avenue of trees and eventually disappeared . He was so complete an aristocrat that he could offer his back to them all the way up that avenue ; and his back never once looked uncomfortable . "" You must allow me to see you home ,"" said Bert to the girl , in a gruff and almost stifled voice ; "" I think we have only a little way to go ."" "" Only a little way ,"" she said , and smiled once more that night , in spite of fatigue and fear and the world and the flesh and the devil ."
chesterton#The glowing and transparent blue of twilight had long been covered by the opaque and slatelike blue of night , when he handed her into the lamp - lit interior of her home . He went out himself into the darkness , walking sturdily , but tearing at his black beard . All the French or semi - French gentry of the district considered this a case in which a duel was natural and inevitable , and neither party had any difficulty in finding seconds , strangers as they were in the place . Two small landowners , who were careful , practising Catholics , willingly undertook to represent that strict church - goer Camille Burt ; while the profligate but apparently powerful Count Gregory found friends in an energetic local doctor who was ready for social promotion and an accidental Californian tourist who was ready for anything . As no particular purpose could be served by delay , it was arranged that the affair should fall out three days afterwards . And when this was settled the whole community , as it were , turned over again in bed and thought no more about the matter .
chesterton#"At least there was only one member of it who seemed to be restless , and that was she who was commonly most restful . On the next night Madeleine Durand went to church as usual ; and as usual the stricken Camille was there also . What was not so usual was that when they were a bow - shot from the church Madeleine turned round and walked back to him . "" Sir ,"" she began , "" it is not wrong of me to speak to you ,"" and the very words gave him a jar of unexpected truth ; for in all the novels he had ever read she would have begun : "" It is wrong of me to speak to you ."" She went on with wide and serious eyes like an animal ' s : "" It is not wrong of me to speak to you , because your soul , or anybody ' s soul , matters so much more than what the world says about anybody . I want to talk to you about what you are going to do ."""
chesterton#"Bert saw in front of him the inevitable heroine of the novels trying to prevent bloodshed ; and his pale firm face became implacable . "" I would do anything but that for you ,"" he said ; "" but no man can be called less than a man ."" She looked at him for a moment with a face openly puzzled , and then broke into an odd and beautiful half - smile . "" Oh , I don ' t mean that ,"" she said ; "" I don ' t talk about what I don ' t understand . No one has ever hit me ; and if they had I should not feel as a man may . I am sure it is not the best thing to fight ."
chesterton#"It would be better to forgive -- if one could really forgive . But when people dine with my father and say that fighting a duel is mere murder -- of course I can see that is not just . It ' s all so different -- having a reason -- and letting the other man know -- and using the same guns and things -- and doing it in front of your friends . I ' m awfully stupid , but I know that men like you aren ' t murderers . But it wasn ' t that that I meant ."" "" What did you mean ?"""
chesterton#"asked the other , looking broodingly at the earth . "" Don ' t you know ,"" she said , "" there is only one more celebration ? I thought that as you always go to church -- I thought you would communicate this morning ."" Bert stepped backward with a sort of action she had never seen in him before . It seemed to alter his whole body . "" You may be right or wrong to risk dying ,"" said the girl , simply ; "" the poor women in our village risk it whenever they have a baby ."
chesterton#"You men are the other half of the world . I know nothing about when you ought to die . But surely if you are daring to try and find God beyond the grave and appeal to Him -- you ought to let Him find you when He comes and stands there every morning in our little church ."" And placid as she was , she made a little gesture of argument , of which the pathos wrung the heart . M . Camille Bert was by no means placid . Before that incomplete gesture and frankly pleading face he retreated as if from the jaws of a dragon ."
chesterton#"His dark black hair and beard looked utterly unnatural against the startling pallor of his face . When at last he said something it was : "" O God ! I can ' t stand this !"" He did not say it in French . Nor did he , strictly speaking , say it in English . The truth ( interesting only to anthropologists ) is that he said it in Scotch ."
chesterton#""" There will be another mass in a matter of eight hours ,"" said Madeleine , with a sort of business eagerness and energy , "" and you can do it then before the fighting . You must forgive me , but I was so frightened that you would not do it at all ."" Bert seemed to crush his teeth together until they broke , and managed to say between them : "" And why should you suppose that I shouldn ' t do as you say -- I mean not to do it at all ?"" "" You always go to Mass ,"" answered the girl , opening her wide blue eyes , "" and the Mass is very long and tiresome unless one loves God ."" Then it was that Bert exploded with a brutality which might have come from Count Gregory , his criminal opponent . He advanced upon Madeleine with flaming eyes , and almost took her by the two shoulders ."
chesterton#""" I do not love God ,"" he cried , speaking French with the broadest Scotch accent ; "" I do not want to find Him ; I do not think He is there to be found . I must burst up the show ; I must and will say everything . You are the happiest and honestest thing I ever saw in this godless universe . And I am the dirtiest and most dishonest ."" Madeleine looked at him doubtfully for an instant , and then said with a sudden simplicity and cheerfulness : "" Oh , but if you are really sorry it is all right . If you are horribly sorry it is all the better ."
chesterton#"You have only to go and tell the priest so and he will give you God out of his own hands ."" "" I hate your priest and I deny your God !"" cried the man , "" and I tell you God is a lie and a fable and a mask . And for the first time in my life I do not feel superior to God ."" "" What can it all mean ?"" said Madeleine , in massive wonder ."
chesterton#""" Because I am a fable also and a mask ,"" said the man . He had been plucking fiercely at his black beard and hair all the time ; now he suddenly plucked them off and flung them like moulted feathers in the mire . This extraordinary spoliation left in the sunlight the same face , but a much younger head -- a head with close chestnut curls and a short chestnut beard . "" Now you know the truth ,"" he answered , with hard eyes . "" I am a cad who has played a crooked trick on a quiet village and a decent woman for a private reason of his own . I might have played it successfully on any other woman ; I have hit the one woman on whom it cannot be played ."
chesterton#"It ' s just like my damned luck . The plain truth is ,"" and here when he came to the plain truth he boggled and blundered as Evan had done in telling it to the girl in the motor - car . "" The plain truth is ,"" he said at last , "" that I am James Turnbull the atheist . The police are after me ; not for atheism but for being ready to fight for it ."" "" I saw something about you in a newspaper ,"" said the girl , with a simplicity which even surprise could never throw off its balance . "" Evan MacIan said there was a God ,"" went on the other , stubbornly , "" and I say there isn ' t ."
chesterton#"And I have come to fight for the fact that there is no God ; it is for that that I have seen this cursed island and your blessed face ."" "" You want me really to believe ,"" said Madeleine , with parted lips , "" that you think ----"" "" I want you to hate me !"" cried Turnbull , in agony . "" I want you to be sick when you think of my name . I am sure there is no God ."""
chesterton#""" But there is ,"" said Madeleine , quite quietly , and rather with the air of one telling children about an elephant . "" Why , I touched His body only this morning ."" "" You touched a bit of bread ,"" said Turnbull , biting his knuckles . "" Oh , I will say anything that can madden you !"" "" You think it is only a bit of bread ,"" said the girl , and her lips tightened ever so little . "" I know it is only a bit of bread ,"" said Turnbull , with violence ."
chesterton#"She flung back her open face and smiled . "" Then why did you refuse to eat it ?"" she said . James Turnbull made a little step backward , and for the first time in his life there seemed to break out and blaze in his head thoughts that were not his own . "" Why , how silly of them ,"" cried out Madeleine , with quite a schoolgirl gaiety , "" why , how silly of them to call _you_ a blasphemer ! Why , you have wrecked your whole business because you would not commit blasphemy ."""
chesterton#"The man stood , a somewhat comic figure in his tragic bewilderment , with the honest red head of James Turnbull sticking out of the rich and fictitious garments of Camille Bert . But the startled pain of his face was strong enough to obliterate the oddity . "" You come down here ,"" continued the lady , with that female emphasis which is so pulverizing in conversation and so feeble at a public meeting , "" you and your MacIan come down here and put on false beards or noses in order to fight . You pretend to be a Catholic commercial traveller from France . Poor Mr . MacIan has to pretend to be a dissolute nobleman from nowhere . Your scheme succeeds ; you pick a quite convincing quarrel ; you arrange a quite respectable duel ; the duel you have planned so long will come off tomorrow with absolute certainty and safety ."
chesterton#"And then you throw off your wig and throw up your scheme and throw over your colleague , because I ask you to go into a building and eat a bit of bread . And _then_ you dare to tell me that you are sure there is nothing watching us . Then you say you know there is nothing on the very altar you run away from . You know ----"" "" I only know ,"" said Turnbull , "" that I must run away from you . This has got beyond any talking ."""
chesterton#And he plunged along into the village , leaving his black wig and beard lying behind him on the road . As the market - place opened before him he saw Count Gregory , that distinguished foreigner , standing and smoking in elegant meditation at the corner of the local caf . He immediately made his way rapidly towards him , considering that a consultation was urgent . But he had hardly crossed half of that stony quadrangle when a window burst open above him and a head was thrust out , shouting . The man was in his woollen undershirt , but Turnbull knew the energetic , apologetic head of the sergeant of police . He pointed furiously at Turnbull and shouted his name .
chesterton#"A policeman ran excitedly from under an archway and tried to collar him . Two men selling vegetables dropped their baskets and joined in the chase . Turnbull dodged the constable , upset one of the men into his own basket , and bounding towards the distinguished foreign Count , called to him clamorously : "" Come on , MacIan , the hunt is up again ."" The prompt reply of Count Gregory was to pull off his large yellow whiskers and scatter them on the breeze with an air of considerable relief . Then he joined the flight of Turnbull , and even as he did so , with one wrench of his powerful hands rent and split the strange , thick stick that he carried . Inside it was a naked old - fashioned rapier ."
chesterton#The two got a good start up the road before the whole town was awakened behind them ; and half - way up it a similar transformation was seen to take place in Mr . Turnbull ' s singular umbrella . The two had a long race for the harbour ; but the English police were heavy and the French inhabitants were indifferent . In any case , they got used to the notion of the road being clear ; and just as they had come to the cliffs MacIan banged into another gentleman with unmistakable surprise . How he knew he was another gentleman merely by banging into him , must remain a mystery . MacIan was a very poor and very sober Scotch gentleman . The other was a very drunk and very wealthy English gentleman .
chesterton#"But there was something in the staggered and openly embarrassed apologies that made them understand each other as readily and as quickly and as much as two men talking French in the middle of China . The nearest expression of the type is that it either hits or apologizes ; and in this case both apologized . "" You seem to be in a hurry ,"" said the unknown Englishman , falling back a step or two in order to laugh with an unnatural heartiness . "" What ' s it all about , eh ?"" Then before MacIan could get past his sprawling and staggering figure he ran forward again and said with a sort of shouting and ear - shattering whisper : "" I say , my name is Wilkinson . _You_ know -- Wilkinson ' s Entire was my grandfather ."
chesterton#"Can ' t drink beer myself . Liver ."" And he shook his head with extraordinary sagacity . "" We really are in a hurry , as you say ,"" said MacIan , summoning a sufficiently pleasant smile , "" so if you will let us pass ----"" "" I ' ll tell you what , you fellows ,"" said the sprawling gentleman , confidentially , while Evan ' s agonized ears heard behind him the first paces of the pursuit , "" if you really are , as you say , in a hurry , I know what it is to be in a hurry -- Lord , what a hurry I was in when we all came out of Cartwright ' s rooms -- if you really are in a hurry ""-- and he seemed to steady his voice into a sort of solemnity --"" if you are in a hurry , there ' s nothing like a good yacht for a man in a hurry ."" "" No doubt you ' re right ,"" said MacIan , and dashed past him in despair ."
chesterton#"The head of the pursuing host was just showing over the top of the hill behind him . Turnbull had already ducked under the intoxicated gentleman ' s elbow and fled far in front . "" No , but look here ,"" said Mr . Wilkinson , enthusiastically running after MacIan and catching him by the sleeve of his coat . "" If you want to hurry you should take a yacht , and if ""-- he said , with a burst of rationality , like one leaping to a further point in logic --"" if you want a yacht -- you can have mine ."" Evan pulled up abruptly and looked back at him . "" We are really in the devil of a hurry ,"" he said , "" and if you really have a yacht , the truth is that we would give our ears for it ."""
chesterton#""" You ' ll find it in harbour ,"" said Wilkinson , struggling with his speech . "" Left side of harbour -- called _Gibson Girl_ -- can ' t think why , old fellow , I never lent it you before ."" With these words the benevolent Mr . Wilkinson fell flat on his face in the road , but continued to laugh softly , and turned towards his flying companion a face of peculiar peace and benignity . Evan ' s mind went through a crisis of instantaneous casuistry , in which it may be that he decided wrongly ; but about how he decided his biographer can profess no doubt . Two minutes afterwards he had overtaken Turnbull and told the tale ; ten minutes afterwards he and Turnbull had somehow tumbled into the yacht called the _Gibson Girl_ and had somehow pushed off from the Isle of St . Loup . XII ."
chesterton#THE DESERT ISLAND Those who happen to hold the view ( and Mr . Evan MacIan , now alive and comfortable , is among the number ) that something supernatural , some eccentric kindness from god or fairy had guided our adventurers through all their absurd perils , might have found his strongest argument perhaps in their management or mismanagement of Mr . Wilkinson ' s yacht . Neither of them had the smallest qualification for managing such a vessel ; but MacIan had a practical knowledge of the sea in much smaller and quite different boats , while Turnbull had an abstract knowledge of science and some of its applications to navigation , which was worse . The presence of the god or fairy can only be deduced from the fact that they never definitely ran into anything , either a boat , a rock , a quicksand , or a man - of - war . Apart from this negative description , their voyage would be difficult to describe . It took at least a fortnight , and MacIan , who was certainly the shrewder sailor of the two , realized that they were sailing west into the Atlantic and were probably by this time past the Scilly Isles .
chesterton#"How much farther they stood out into the western sea it was impossible to conjecture . But they felt certain , at least , that they were far enough into that awful gulf between us and America to make it unlikely that they would soon see land again . It was therefore with legitimate excitement that one rainy morning after daybreak they saw that distinct shape of a solitary island standing up against the encircling strip of silver which ran round the skyline and separated the grey and green of the billows from the grey and mauve of the morning clouds . "" What can it be ?"" cried MacIan , in a dry - throated excitement . "" I didn ' t know there were any Atlantic islands so far beyond the Scillies -- Good Lord , it can ' t be Madeira , yet ?"""
chesterton#""" I thought you were fond of legends and lies and fables ,"" said Turnbull , grimly . "" Perhaps it ' s Atlantis ."" "" Of course , it might be ,"" answered the other , quite innocently and gravely ; "" but I never thought the story about Atlantis was very solidly established ."" "" Whatever it is , we are running on to it ,"" said Turnbull , equably , "" and we shall be shipwrecked twice , at any rate ."" The naked - looking nose of land projecting from the unknown island was , indeed , growing larger and larger , like the trunk of some terrible and advancing elephant . There seemed to be nothing in particular , at least on this side of the island , except shoals of shellfish lying so thick as almost to make it look like one of those toy grottos that the children make ."
chesterton#"In one place , however , the coast offered a soft , smooth bay of sand , and even the rudimentary ingenuity of the two amateur mariners managed to run up the little ship with her prow well on shore and her bowsprit pointing upward , as in a sort of idiotic triumph . They tumbled on shore and began to unload the vessel , setting the stores out in rows upon the sand with something of the solemnity of boys playing at pirates . There were Mr . Wilkinson ' s cigar - boxes and Mr . Wilkinson ' s dozen of champagne and Mr . Wilkinson ' s tinned salmon and Mr . Wilkinson ' s tinned tongue and Mr . Wilkinson ' s tinned sardines , and every sort of preserved thing that could be seen at the Army and Navy stores . Then MacIan stopped with a jar of pickles in his hand and said abruptly : "" I don ' t know why we ' re doing all this ; I suppose we ought really to fall to and get it over ."" Then he added more thoughtfully : "" Of course this island seems rather bare and the survivor ----"""
chesterton#""" The question is ,"" said Turnbull , with cheerful speculation , "" whether the survivor will be in a proper frame of mind for potted prawns ."" MacIan looked down at the rows of tins and bottles , and the cloud of doubt still lowered upon his face . "" You will permit me two liberties , my dear sir ,"" said Turnbull at last : "" The first is to break open this box and light one of Mr . Wilkinson ' s excellent cigars , which will , I am sure , assist my meditations ; the second is to offer a penny for your thoughts ; or rather to convulse the already complex finances of this island by betting a penny that I know them ."" "" What on earth are you talking about ?"" asked MacIan , listlessly , in the manner of an inattentive child . "" I know what you are really thinking , MacIan ,"" repeated Turnbull , laughing ."
chesterton#""" I know what I am thinking , anyhow . And I rather fancy it ' s the same ."" "" What are you thinking ?"" asked Evan . "" I am thinking and you are thinking ,"" said Turnbull , "" that it is damned silly to waste all that champagne ."" Something like the spectre of a smile appeared on the unsmiling visage of the Gael ; and he made at least no movement of dissent ."
chesterton#""" We could drink all the wine and smoke all the cigars easily in a week ,"" said Turnbull ; "" and that would be to die feasting like heroes ."" "" Yes , and there is something else ,"" said MacIan , with slight hesitation . "" You see , we are on an almost unknown rock , lost in the Atlantic . The police will never catch us ; but then neither may the public ever hear of us ; and that was one of the things we wanted ."" Then , after a pause , he said , drawing in the sand with his sword - point : "" She may never hear of it at all ."" "" Well ?"""
chesterton#"inquired the other , puffing at his cigar . "" Well ,"" said MacIan , "" we might occupy a day or two in drawing up a thorough and complete statement of what we did and why we did it , and all about both our points of view . Then we could leave one copy on the island whatever happens to us and put another in an empty bottle and send it out to sea , as they do in the books ."" "" A good idea ,"" said Turnbull , "" and now let us finish unpacking ."" As MacIan , a tall , almost ghostly figure , paced along the edge of sand that ran round the islet , the purple but cloudy poetry which was his native element was piled up at its thickest upon his soul . The unique island and the endless sea emphasized the thing solely as an epic ."
chesterton#"There were no ladies or policemen here to give him a hint either of its farce or its tragedy . "" Perhaps when the morning stars were made ,"" he said to himself , "" God built this island up from the bottom of the world to be a tower and a theatre for the fight between yea and nay ."" Then he wandered up to the highest level of the rock , where there was a roof or plateau of level stone . Half an hour afterwards , Turnbull found him clearing away the loose sand from this table - land and making it smooth and even . "" We will fight up here , Turnbull ,"" said MacIan , "" when the time comes . And till the time comes this place shall be sacred ."""
chesterton#""" I thought of having lunch up here ,"" said Turnbull , who had a bottle of champagne in his hand . "" No , no -- not up here ,"" said MacIan , and came down from the height quite hastily . Before he descended , however , he fixed the two swords upright , one at each end of the platform , as if they were human sentinels to guard it under the stars . Then they came down and lunched plentifully in a nest of loose rocks . In the same place that night they supped more plentifully still . The smoke of Mr . Wilkinson ' s cigars went up ceaseless and strong smelling , like a pagan sacrifice ; the golden glories of Mr . Wilkinson ' s champagne rose to their heads and poured out of them in fancies and philosophies ."
chesterton#And occasionally they would look up at the starlight and the rock and see the space guarded by the two cross - hilted swords , which looked like two black crosses at either end of a grave . In this primitive and Homeric truce the week passed by ; it consisted almost entirely of eating , drinking , smoking , talking , and occasionally singing . They wrote their records and cast loose their bottle . They never ascended to the ominous plateau ; they had never stood there save for that single embarrassed minute when they had had no time to take stock of the seascape or the shape of the land . They did not even explore the island ; for MacIan was partly concerned in prayer and Turnbull entirely concerned with tobacco ; and both these forms of inspiration can be enjoyed by the secluded and even the sedentary . It was on a golden afternoon , the sun sinking over the sea , rayed like the very head of Apollo , when Turnbull tossed off the last half - pint from the emptied Wilkinsonian bottle , hurled the bottle into the sea with objectless energy , and went up to where his sword stood waiting for him on the hill .
chesterton#MacIan was already standing heavily by his with bent head and eyes reading the ground . He had not even troubled to throw a glance round the island or the horizon . But Turnbull being of a more active and birdlike type of mind did throw a glance round the scene . The consequence of which was that he nearly fell off the rock . On three sides of this shelly and sandy islet the sea stretched blue and infinite without a speck of land or sail ; the same as Turnbull had first seen it , except that the tide being out it showed a few yards more of slanting sand under the roots of the rocks . But on the fourth side the island exhibited a more extraordinary feature .
chesterton#"In fact , it exhibited the extraordinary feature of not being an island at all . A long , curving neck of sand , as smooth and wet as the neck of the sea serpent , ran out into the sea and joined their rock to a line of low , billowing , and glistening sand - hills , which the sinking sea had just bared to the sun . Whether they were firm sand or quicksand it was difficult to guess ; but there was at least no doubt that they lay on the edge of some larger land ; for colourless hills appeared faintly behind them and no sea could be seen beyond . "" Sakes alive !"" cried Turnbull , with rolling eyes ; "" this ain ' t an island in the Atlantic . We ' ve butted the bally continent of America ."""
chesterton#"MacIan turned his head , and his face , already pale , grew a shade paler . He was by this time walking in a world of omens and hieroglyphics , and he could not read anything but what was baffling or menacing in this brown gigantic arm of the earth stretched out into the sea to seize him . "" MacIan ,"" said Turnbull , in his temperate way , "" whatever our eternal interrupted tete - a - tetes have taught us or not taught us , at least we need not fear the charge of fear . If it is essential to your emotions , I will cheerfully finish the fight here and now ; but I must confess that if you kill me here I shall die with my curiosity highly excited and unsatisfied upon a minor point of geography ."" "" I do not want to stop now ,"" said the other , in his elephantine simplicity , "" but we must stop for a moment , because it is a sign -- perhaps it is a miracle . We must see what is at the end of the road of sand ; it may be a bridge built across the gulf by God ."""
chesterton#""" So long as you gratify my query ,"" said Turnbull , laughing and letting back his blade into the sheath , "" I do not care for what reason you choose to stop ."" They clambered down the rocky peninsula and trudged along the sandy isthmus with the plodding resolution of men who seemed almost to have made up their minds to be wanderers on the face of the earth . Despite Turnbull ' s air of scientific eagerness , he was really the less impatient of the two ; and the Highlander went on well ahead of him with passionate strides . By the time they had walked for about half an hour in the ups and downs of those dreary sands , the distance between the two had lengthened and MacIan was only a tall figure silhouetted for an instant upon the crest of some sand - dune and then disappearing behind it . This rather increased the Robinson Crusoe feeling in Mr . Turnbull , and he looked about almost disconsolately for some sign of life . What sort of life he expected it to be if it appeared , he did not very clearly know ."
chesterton#"He has since confessed that he thinks that in his subconsciousness he expected an alligator . The first sign of life that he did see , however , was something more extraordinary than the largest alligator . It was nothing less than the notorious Mr . Evan MacIan coming bounding back across the sand - heaps breathless , without his cap and keeping the sword in his hand only by a habit now quite hardened . "" Take care , Turnbull ,"" he cried out from a good distance as he ran , "" I ' ve seen a native ."" "" A native ?"" repeated his companion , whose scenery had of late been chiefly of shellfish , "" what the deuce !"
chesterton#"Do you mean an oyster ?"" "" No ,"" said MacIan , stopping and breathing hard , "" I mean a savage . A black man ."" "" Why , where did you see him ?"" asked the staring editor . "" Over there -- behind that hill ,"" said the gasping MacIan ."
chesterton#""" He put up his black head and grinned at me ."" Turnbull thrust his hands through his red hair like one who gives up the world as a bad riddle . "" Lord love a duck ,"" said he , "" can it be Jamaica ?"" Then glancing at his companion with a small frown , as of one slightly suspicious , he said : "" I say , don ' t think me rude -- but you ' re a visionary kind of fellow -- and then we drank a great deal . Do you mind waiting here while I go and see for myself ?"" "" Shout if you get into trouble ,"" said the Celt , with composure ; "" you will find it as I say ."""
chesterton#Turnbull ran off ahead with a rapidity now far greater than his rival ' s , and soon vanished over the disputed sand - hill . Then five minutes passed , and then seven minutes ; and MacIan bit his lip and swung his sword , and the other did not reappear . Finally , with a Gaelic oath , Evan started forward to the rescue , and almost at the same moment the small figure of the missing man appeared on the ridge against the sky . Even at that distance , however , there was something odd about his attitude ; so odd that MacIan continued to make his way in that direction . It looked as if he were wounded ; or , still more , as if he were ill . He wavered as he came down the slope and seemed flinging himself into peculiar postures .
chesterton#"But it was only when he came within three feet of MacIan ' s face , that that observer of mankind fully realized that Mr . James Turnbull was roaring with laughter . "" You are quit right ,"" sobbed that wholly demoralized journalist . "" He ' s black , oh , there ' s no doubt the black ' s all right -- as far as it goes ."" And he went off again into convulsions of his humorous ailment . "" What ever is the matter with you ?"" asked MacIan , with stern impatience ."
chesterton#""" Did you see the nigger ----"" "" I saw the nigger ,"" gasped Turnbull . "" I saw the splendid barbarian Chief . I saw the Emperor of Ethiopia -- oh , I saw him all right . The nigger ' s hands and face are a lovely colour -- and the nigger ----"" And he was overtaken once more . "" Well , well , well ,"" said Evan , stamping each monosyllable on the sand , "" what about the nigger ?"""
chesterton#""" Well , the truth is ,"" said Turnbull , suddenly and startlingly , becoming quite grave and precise , "" the truth is , the nigger is a Margate nigger , and we are now on the edge of the Isle of Thanet , a few miles from Margate ."" Then he had a momentary return of his hysteria and said : "" I say , old boy , I should like to see a chart of our fortnight ' s cruise in Wilkinson ' s yacht ."" MacIan had no smile in answer , but his eager lips opened as if parched for the truth . "" You mean to say ,"" he began ---- "" Yes , I mean to say ,"" said Turnbull , "" and I mean to say something funnier still . I have learnt everything I wanted to know from the partially black musician over there , who has taken a run in his war - paint to meet a friend in a quiet pub along the coast -- the noble savage has told me all about it ."
chesterton#"The bottle containing our declaration , doctrines , and dying sentiments was washed up on Margate beach yesterday in the presence of one alderman , two bathing - machine men , three policemen , seven doctors , and a hundred and thirteen London clerks on a holiday , to all of whom , whether directly or indirectly , our composition gave enormous literary pleasure . Buck up , old man , this story of ours is a switchback . I have begun to understand the pulse and the time of it ; now we are up in a cathedral and then we are down in a theatre , where they only play farces . Come , I am quite reconciled -- let us enjoy the farce ."" But MacIan said nothing , and an instant afterwards Turnbull himself called out in an entirely changed voice : "" Oh , this is damnable ! This is not to be borne !"""
chesterton#MacIan followed his eye along the sand - hills . He saw what looked like the momentary and waving figure of the nigger minstrel , and then he saw a heavy running policeman take the turn of the sand - hill with the smooth solemnity of a railway train . XIII . THE GARDEN OF PEACE Up to this instant Evan MacIan had really understood nothing ; but when he saw the policeman he saw everything . He saw his enemies , all the powers and princes of the earth .
chesterton#"He suddenly altered from a staring statue to a leaping man of the mountains . "" We must break away from him here ,"" he cried , briefly , and went like a whirlwind over the sand ridge in a straight line and at a particular angle . When the policeman had finished his admirable railway curve , he found a wall of failing sand between him and the pursued . By the time he had scaled it thrice , slid down twice , and crested it in the third effort , the two flying figures were far in front . They found the sand harder farther on ; it began to be crusted with scraps of turf and in a few moments they were flying easily over an open common of rank sea - grass . They had no easy business , however ; for the bottle which they had so innocently sent into the chief gate of Thanet had called to life the police of half a county on their trail ."
chesterton#"From every side across the grey - green common figures could be seen running and closing in ; and it was only when MacIan with his big body broke down the tangled barrier of a little wood , as men break down a door with the shoulder ; it was only when they vanished crashing into the underworld of the black wood , that their hunters were even instantaneously thrown off the scent . At the risk of struggling a little longer like flies in that black web of twigs and trunks , Evan ( who had an instinct of the hunter or the hunted ) took an incalculable course through the forest , which let them out at last by a forest opening -- quite forgotten by the leaders of the chase . They ran a mile or two farther along the edge of the wood until they reached another and somewhat similar opening . Then MacIan stood utterly still and listened , as animals listen , for every sound in the universe . Then he said : "" We are quit of them ."" And Turnbull said : "" Where shall we go now ?"""
chesterton#"MacIan looked at the silver sunset that was closing in , barred by plumy lines of purple cloud ; he looked at the high tree - tops that caught the last light and at the birds going heavily homeward , just as if all these things were bits of written advice that he could read . Then he said : "" The best place we can go to is to bed . If we can get some sleep in this wood , now everyone has cleared out of it , it will be worth a handicap of two hundred yards tomorrow ."" Turnbull , who was exceptionally lively and laughing in his demeanour , kicked his legs about like a schoolboy and said he did not want to go to sleep . He walked incessantly and talked very brilliantly . And when at last he lay down on the hard earth , sleep struck him senseless like a hammer ."
chesterton#"Indeed , he needed the strongest sleep he could get ; for the earth was still full of darkness and a kind of morning fog when his fellow - fugitive shook him awake . "" No more sleep , I ' m afraid ,"" said Evan , in a heavy , almost submissive , voice of apology . "" They ' ve gone on past us right enough for a good thirty miles ; but now they ' ve found out their mistake , and they ' re coming back ."" "" Are you sure ?"" said Turnbull , sitting up and rubbing his red eyebrows with his hand . The next moment , however , he had jumped up alive and leaping like a man struck with a shock of cold water , and he was plunging after MacIan along the woodland path ."
chesterton#The shape of their old friend the constable had appeared against the pearl and pink of the sunrise . Somehow , it always looked a very funny shape when seen against the sunrise . * * * A wash of weary daylight was breaking over the country - side , and the fields and roads were full of white mist -- the kind of white mist that clings in corners like cotton wool . The empty road , along which the chase had taken its turn , was overshadowed on one side by a very high discoloured wall , stained , and streaked green , as with seaweed -- evidently the high - shouldered sentinel of some great gentleman ' s estate . A yard or two from the wall ran parallel to it a linked and tangled line of lime - trees , forming a kind of cloister along the side of the road .
chesterton#It was under this branching colonnade that the two fugitives fled , almost concealed from their pursuers by the twilight , the mist and the leaping zoetrope of shadows . Their feet , though beating the ground furiously , made but a faint noise ; for they had kicked away their boots in the wood ; their long , antiquated weapons made no jingle or clatter , for they had strapped them across their backs like guitars . They had all the advantages that invisibility and silence can add to speed . A hundred and fifty yards behind them down the centre of the empty road the first of their pursuers came pounding and panting -- a fat but powerful policeman who had distanced all the rest . He came on at a splendid pace for so portly a figure ; but , like all heavy bodies in motion , he gave the impression that it would be easier for him to increase his pace than to slacken it suddenly . Nothing short of a brick wall could have abruptly brought him up .
chesterton#Turnbull turned his head slightly and found breath to say something to MacIan . MacIan nodded . Pursuer and pursued were fixed in their distance as they fled , for some quarter of a mile , when they came to a place where two or three of the trees grew twistedly together , making a special obscurity . Past this place the pursuing policeman went thundering without thought or hesitation . But he was pursuing his shadow or the wind ; for Turnbull had put one foot in a crack of the tree and gone up it as quickly and softly as a cat . Somewhat more laboriously but in equal silence the long legs of the Highlander had followed ; and crouching in crucial silence in the cloud of leaves , they saw the whole posse of their pursuers go by and die into the dust and mists of the distance .
chesterton#The white vapour lay , as it often does , in lean and palpable layers ; and even the head of the tree was above it in the half - daylight , like a green ship swinging on a sea of foam . But higher yet behind them , and readier to catch the first coming of the sun , ran the rampart of the top of the wall , which in their excitement of escape looked at once indispensable and unattainable , like the wall of heaven . Here , however , it was MacIan ' s turn to have the advantage ; for , though less light - limbed and feline , he was longer and stronger in the arms . In two seconds he had tugged up his chin over the wall like a horizontal bar ; the next he sat astride of it , like a horse of stone . With his assistance Turnbull vaulted to the same perch , and the two began cautiously to shift along the wall in the direction by which they had come , doubling on their tracks to throw off the last pursuit . MacIan could not rid himself of the fancy of bestriding a steed ; the long , grey coping of the wall shot out in front of him , like the long , grey neck of some nightmare Rosinante .
chesterton#He had the quaint thought that he and Turnbull were two knights on one steed on the old shield of the Templars . The nightmare of the stone horse was increased by the white fog , which seemed thicker inside the wall than outside . They could make nothing of the enclosure upon which they were partial trespassers , except that the green and crooked branches of a big apple - tree came crawling at them out of the mist , like the tentacles of some green cuttlefish . Anything would serve , however , that was likely to confuse their trail , so they both decided without need of words to use this tree also as a ladder -- a ladder of descent . When they dropped from the lowest branch to the ground their stockinged feet felt hard gravel beneath them . They had alighted in the middle of a very broad garden path , and the clearing mist permitted them to see the edge of a well - clipped lawn .
chesterton#Though the white vapour was still a veil , it was like the gauzy veil of a transformation scene in a pantomime ; for through it there glowed shapeless masses of colour , masses which might be clouds of sunrise or mosaics of gold and crimson , or ladies robed in ruby and emerald draperies . As it thinned yet farther they saw that it was only flowers ; but flowers in such insolent mass and magnificence as can seldom be seen out of the tropics . Purple and crimson rhododendrons rose arrogantly , like rampant heraldic animals against their burning background of laburnum gold . The roses were red hot ; the clematis was , so to speak , blue hot . And yet the mere whiteness of the syringa seemed the most violent colour of all . As the golden sunlight gradually conquered the mists , it had really something of the sensational sweetness of the slow opening of the gates of Eden .
chesterton#MacIan , whose mind was always haunted with such seraphic or titanic parallels , made some such remark to his companion . But Turnbull only cursed and said that it was the back garden of some damnable rich man . When the last haze had faded from the ordered paths , the open lawns , and the flaming flower - beds , the two realized , not without an abrupt re - examination of their position , that they were not alone in the garden . Down the centre of the central garden path , preceded by a blue cloud from a cigarette , was walking a gentleman who evidently understood all the relish of a garden in the very early morning . He was a slim yet satisfied figure , clad in a suit of pale - grey tweed , so subdued that the pattern was imperceptible -- a costume that was casual but not by any means careless . His face , which was reflective and somewhat over - refined , was the face of a quite elderly man , though his stringy hair and moustache were still quite yellow .
chesterton#"A double eye - glass , with a broad , black ribbon , drooped from his aquiline nose , and he smiled , as he communed with himself , with a self - content which was rare and almost irritating . The straw panama on his head was many shades shabbier than his clothes , as if he had caught it up by accident . It needed the full shock of the huge shadow of MacIan , falling across his sunlit path , to rouse him from his smiling reverie . When this had fallen on him he lifted his head a little and blinked at the intruders with short - sighted benevolence , but with far less surprise than might have been expected . He was a gentleman ; that is , he had social presence of mind , whether for kindness or for insolence . "" Can I do anything for you ?"""
chesterton#"he said , at last . MacIan bowed . "" You can extend to us your pardon ,"" he said , for he also came of a whole race of gentlemen -- of gentlemen without shirts to their backs . "" I am afraid we are trespassing . We have just come over the wall ."" "" Over the wall ?"""
chesterton#"repeated the smiling old gentleman , still without letting his surprise come uppermost . "" I suppose I am not wrong , sir ,"" continued MacIan , "" in supposing that these grounds inside the wall belong to you ?"" The man in the panama looked at the ground and smoked thoughtfully for a few moments , after which he said , with a sort of matured conviction : "" Yes , certainly ; the grounds inside the wall really belong to me , and the grounds outside the wall , too ."" "" A large proprietor , I imagine ,"" said Turnbull , with a truculent eye . "" Yes ,"" answered the old gentleman , looking at him with a steady smile ."
chesterton#""" A large proprietor ."" Turnbull ' s eye grew even more offensive , and he began biting his red beard ; but MacIan seemed to recognize a type with which he could deal and continued quite easily : "" I am sure that a man like you will not need to be told that one sees and does a good many things that do not get into the newspapers . Things which , on the whole , had better not get into the newspapers ."" The smile of the large proprietor broadened for a moment under his loose , light moustache , and the other continued with increased confidence : "" One sometimes wants to have it out with another man ."
chesterton#"The police won ' t allow it in the streets -- and then there ' s the County Council -- and in the fields even nothing ' s allowed but posters of pills . But in a gentleman ' s garden , now ----"" The strange gentleman smiled again and said , easily enough : "" Do you want to fight ? What do you want to fight about ?"" MacIan had understood his man pretty well up to that point ; an instinct common to all men with the aristocratic tradition of Europe had guided him . He knew that the kind of man who in his own back garden wears good clothes and spoils them with a bad hat is not the kind of man who has an abstract horror of illegal actions of violence or the evasion of the police ."
chesterton#"But a man may understand ragging and yet be very far from understanding religious ragging . This seeming host of theirs might comprehend a quarrel of husband and lover or a difficulty at cards or even escape from a pursuing tailor ; but it still remained doubtful whether he would feel the earth fail under him in that earthquake instant when the Virgin is compared to a goddess of Mesopotamia . Even MacIan , therefore ( whose tact was far from being his strong point ), felt the necessity for some compromise in the mode of approach . At last he said , and even then with hesitation : "" We are fighting about God ; there can be nothing so important as that ."" The tilted eye - glasses of the old gentleman fell abruptly from his nose , and he thrust his aristocratic chin so far forward that his lean neck seemed to shoot out longer like a telescope ."
chesterton#""" About God ?"" he queried , in a key completely new . "" Look here !"" cried Turnbull , taking his turn roughly , "" I ' ll tell you what it ' s all about . I think that there ' s no God . I take it that it ' s nobody ' s business but mine -- or God ' s , if there is one ."
chesterton#"This young gentleman from the Highlands happens to think that it ' s his business . In consequence , he first takes a walking - stick and smashes my shop ; then he takes the same walking - stick and tries to smash me . To this I naturally object . I suggest that if it comes to that we should both have sticks . He improves on the suggestion and proposes that we should both have steel - pointed sticks . The police ( with characteristic unreasonableness ) will not accept either of our proposals ; the result is that we run about dodging the police and have jumped over our garden wall into your magnificent garden to throw ourselves on your magnificent hospitality ."""
chesterton#"The face of the old gentleman had grown redder and redder during this address , but it was still smiling ; and when he broke out it was with a kind of guffaw . "" So you really want to fight with drawn swords in my garden ,"" he asked , "" about whether there is really a God ?"" "" Why not ?"" said MacIan , with his simple monstrosity of speech ; "" all man ' s worship began when the Garden of Eden was founded ."" "" Yes , by ----!"" said Turnbull , with an oath , "" and ended when the Zoological Gardens were founded ."""
chesterton#""" In this garden ! In my presence !"" cried the stranger , stamping up and down the gravel and choking with laughter ,"" whether there is a God !"" And he went stamping up and down the garden , making it echo with his unintelligible laughter . Then he came back to them more composed and wiping his eyes . "" Why , how small the world is !"""
chesterton#"he cried at last . "" I can settle the whole matter . Why , I am God !"" And he suddenly began to kick and wave his well - clad legs about the lawn . "" You are what ?"" repeated Turnbull , in a tone which is beyond description ."
chesterton#""" Why , God , of course !"" answered the other , thoroughly amused . "" How funny it is to think that you have tumbled over a garden wall and fallen exactly on the right person ! You might have gone floundering about in all sorts of churches and chapels and colleges and schools of philosophy looking for some evidence of the existence of God . Why , there is no evidence , except seeing him . And now you ' ve seen him ."
chesterton#"You ' ve seen him dance !"" And the obliging old gentleman instantly stood on one leg without relaxing at all the grave and cultured benignity of his expression . "" I understood that this garden ----"" began the bewildered MacIan . "" Quite so ! Quite so !"" said the man on one leg , nodding gravely ."
chesterton#""" I said this garden belonged to me and the land outside it . So they do . So does the country beyond that and the sea beyond that and all the rest of the earth . So does the moon . So do the sun and stars ."" And he added , with a smile of apology : "" You see , I ' m God ."""
chesterton#Turnbull and MacIan looked at him for one moment with a sort of notion that perhaps he was not too old to be merely playing the fool . But after staring steadily for an instant Turnbull saw the hard and horrible earnestness in the man ' s eyes behind all his empty animation . Then Turnbull looked very gravely at the strict gravel walls and the gay flower - beds and the long rectangular red - brick building , which the mist had left evident beyond them . Then he looked at MacIan . Almost at the same moment another man came walking quickly round the regal clump of rhododendrons . He had the look of a prosperous banker , wore a good tall silk hat , was almost stout enough to burst the buttons of a fine frock - coat ; but he was talking to himself , and one of his elbows had a singular outward jerk as he went by .
chesterton#"XIV . A MUSEUM OF SOULS The man with the good hat and the jumping elbow went by very quickly ; yet the man with the bad hat , who thought he was God , overtook him . He ran after him and jumped over a bed of geraniums to catch him . "" I beg your Majesty ' s pardon ,"" he said , with mock humility , "" but here is a quarrel which you ought really to judge ."" Then as he led the heavy , silk - hatted man back towards the group , he caught MacIan ' s ear in order to whisper : "" This poor gentleman is mad ; he thinks he is Edward VII ."""
chesterton#"At this the self - appointed Creator slightly winked . "" Of course you won ' t trust him much ; come to me for everything . But in my position one has to meet so many people . One has to be broadminded ."" The big banker in the black frock - coat and hat was standing quite grave and dignified on the lawn , save for his slight twitch of one limb , and he did not seem by any means unworthy of the part which the other promptly forced upon him . "" My dear fellow ,"" said the man in the straw hat , "" these two gentlemen are going to fight a duel of the utmost importance ."
chesterton#"Your own royal position and my much humbler one surely indicate us as the proper seconds . Seconds -- yes , seconds ----"" and here the speaker was once more shaken with his old malady of laughter . "" Yes , you and I are both seconds -- and these two gentlemen can obviously fight in front of us . You , he - he , are the king . I am God ; really , they could hardly have better supporters . They have come to the right place ."""
chesterton#"Then Turnbull , who had been staring with a frown at the fresh turf , burst out with a rather bitter laugh and cried , throwing his red head in the air : "" Yes , by God , MacIan , I think we have come to the right place !"" And MacIan answered , with an adamantine stupidity : "" Any place is the right place where they will let us do it ."" There was a long stillness , and their eyes involuntarily took in the landscape , as they had taken in all the landscapes of their everlasting combat ; the bright , square garden behind the shop ; the whole lift and leaning of the side of Hampstead Heath ; the little garden of the decadent choked with flowers ; the square of sand beside the sea at sunrise . They both felt at the same moment all the breadth and blossoming beauty of that paradise , the coloured trees , the natural and restful nooks and also the great wall of stone -- more awful than the wall of China -- from which no flesh could flee ."
chesterton#"Turnbull was moodily balancing his sword in his hand as the other spoke ; then he started , for a mouth whispered quite close to his ear . With a softness incredible in any cat , the huge , heavy man in the black hat and frock - coat had crept across the lawn from his own side and was saying in his ear : "" Don ' t trust that second of yours . He ' s mad and not so mad , either ; for he frightfully cunning and sharp . Don ' t believe the story he tells you about why I hate him . I know the story he ' ll tell ; I overheard it when the housekeeper was talking to the postman . It ' s too long to talk about now , and I expect we ' re watched , but ----"""
chesterton#"Something in Turnbull made him want suddenly to be sick on the grass ; the mere healthy and heathen horror of the unclean ; the mere inhumane hatred of the inhuman state of madness . He seemed to hear all round him the hateful whispers of that place , innumerable as leaves whispering in the wind , and each of them telling eagerly some evil that had not happened or some terrific secret which was not true . All the rationalist and plain man revolted within him against bowing down for a moment in that forest of deception and egotistical darkness . He wanted to blow up that palace of delusions with dynamite ; and in some wild way , which I will not defend , he tried to do it . He looked across at MacIan and said : "" Oh , I can ' t stand this !"" "" Can ' t stand what ?"""
chesterton#"asked his opponent , eyeing him doubtfully . "" Shall we say the atmosphere ?"" replied Turnbull ; "" one can ' t use uncivil expressions even to a -- deity . The fact is , I don ' t like having God for my second ."" "" Sir !"" said that being in a state of great offence , "" in my position I am not used to having my favours refused ."
chesterton#"Do you know who I am ?"" The editor of _The Atheist_ turned upon him like one who has lost all patience , and exploded : "" Yes , you are God , aren ' t you ?"" he said , abruptly , "" why do we have two sets of teeth ?"" "" Teeth ?"" spluttered the genteel lunatic ; "" teeth ?"" "" Yes ,"" cried Turnbull , advancing on him swiftly and with animated gestures , "" why does teething hurt ?"
chesterton#"Why do growing pains hurt ? Why are measles catching ? Why does a rose have thorns ? Why do rhinoceroses have horns ? Why is the horn on the top of the nose ? Why haven ' t I a horn on the top of my nose , eh ?"""
chesterton#"And he struck the bridge of his nose smartly with his forefinger to indicate the place of the omission and then wagged the finger menacingly at the Creator . "" I ' ve often wanted to meet you ,"" he resumed , sternly , after a pause , "" to hold you accountable for all the idiocy and cruelty of this muddled and meaningless world of yours . You make a hundred seeds and only one bears fruit . You make a million worlds and only one seems inhabited . What do you mean by it , eh ? What do you mean by it ?"""
chesterton#"The unhappy lunatic had fallen back before this quite novel form of attack , and lifted his burnt - out cigarette almost like one warding off a blow . Turnbull went on like a torrent . "" A man died yesterday in Ealing . You murdered him . A girl had the toothache in Croydon . You gave it her ."
chesterton#"Fifty sailors were drowned off Selsey Bill . You scuttled their ship . What have you got to say for yourself , eh ?"" The representative of omnipotence looked as if he had left most of these things to his subordinates ; he passed a hand over his wrinkling brow and said in a voice much saner than any he had yet used : "" Well , if you dislike my assistance , of course -- perhaps the other gentleman ----"" "" The other gentleman ,"" cried Turnbull , scornfully , "" is a submissive and loyal and obedient gentleman ."
chesterton#"He likes the people who wear crowns , whether of diamonds or of stars . He believes in the divine right of kings , and it is appropriate enough that he should have the king for his second . But it is not appropriate to me that I should have God for my second . God is not good enough . I dislike and I deny the divine right of kings . But I dislike more and I deny more the divine right of divinity ."""
chesterton#"Then after a pause in which he swallowed his passion , he said to MacIan : "" You have got the right second , anyhow ."" The Highlander did not answer , but stood as if thunderstruck with one long and heavy thought . Then at last he turned abruptly to his second in the silk hat and said : "" Who are you ?"" The man in the silk hat blinked and bridled in affected surprise , like one who was in truth accustomed to be doubted . "" I am King Edward VII ,"" he said , with shaky arrogance . "" Do you doubt my word ?"""
chesterton#""" I do not doubt it in the least ,"" answered MacIan . "" Then , why ,"" said the large man in the silk hat , trembling from head to foot , "" why do you wear your hat before the king ?"" "" Why should I take it off ,"" retorted MacIan , with equal heat , "" before a usurper ?"" Turnbull swung round on his heel . "" Well , really ,"" he said , "" I thought at least you were a loyal subject ."" "" I am the only loyal subject ,"" answered the Gael ."
chesterton#""" For nearly thirty years I have walked these islands and have not found another ."" "" You are always hard to follow ,"" remarked Turnbull , genially , "" and sometimes so much so as to be hardly worth following ."" "" I alone am loyal ,"" insisted MacIan ; "" for I alone am in rebellion . I am ready at any instant to restore the Stuarts . I am ready at any instant to defy the Hanoverian brood -- and I defy it now even when face to face with the actual ruler of the enormous British Empire !"" And folding his arms and throwing back his lean , hawklike face , he haughtily confronted the man with the formal frock - coat and the eccentric elbow ."
chesterton#""" What right had you stunted German squires ,"" he cried , "" to interfere in a quarrel between Scotch and English and Irish gentlemen ? Who made you , whose fathers could not splutter English while they walked in Whitehall , who made you the judge between the republic of Sidney and the monarchy of Montrose ? What had your sires to do with England that they should have the foul offering of the blood of Derwentwater and the heart of Jimmy Dawson ? Where are the corpses of Culloden ? Where is the blood of Lochiel ?"" MacIan advanced upon his opponent with a bony and pointed finger , as if indicating the exact pocket in which the blood of that Cameron was probably kept ; and Edward VII fell back a few paces in considerable confusion ."
chesterton#""" What good have you ever done to us ?"" he continued in harsher and harsher accents , forcing the other back towards the flower - beds . "" What good have you ever done , you race of German sausages ? Yards of barbarian etiquette , to throttle the freedom of aristocracy ! Gas of northern metaphysics to blow up Broad Church bishops like balloons . Bad pictures and bad manners and pantheism and the Albert Memorial ."
chesterton#"Go back to Hanover , you humbug ? Go to ----"" Before the end of this tirade the arrogance of the monarch had entirely given way ; he had fairly turned tail and was trundling away down the path . MacIan strode after him still preaching and flourishing his large , lean hands . The other two remained in the centre of the lawn -- Turnbull in convulsions of laughter , the lunatic in convulsions of disgust . Almost at the same moment a third figure came stepping swiftly across the lawn ."
chesterton#The advancing figure walked with a stoop , and yet somehow flung his forked and narrow beard forward . That carefully cut and pointed yellow beard was , indeed , the most emphatic thing about him . When he clasped his hands behind him , under the tails of his coat , he would wag his beard at a man like a big forefinger . It performed almost all his gestures ; it was more important than the glittering eye - glasses through which he looked or the beautiful bleating voice in which he spoke . His face and neck were of a lusty red , but lean and stringy ; he always wore his expensive gold - rim eye - glasses slightly askew upon his aquiline nose ; and he always showed two gleaming foreteeth under his moustache , in a smile so perpetual as to earn the reputation of a sneer . But for the crooked glasses his dress was always exquisite ; and but for the smile he was perfectly and perennially depressed .
chesterton#""" Don ' t you think ,"" said the new - comer , with a sort of supercilious entreaty , "" that we had better all come into breakfast ? It is such a mistake to wait for breakfast . It spoils one ' s temper so much ."" "" Quite so ,"" replied Turnbull , seriously . "" There seems almost to have been a little quarrelling here ,"" said the man with the goatish beard . "" It is rather a long story ,"" said Turnbull , smiling ."
chesterton#""" Originally , it might be called a phase in the quarrel between science and religion ."" The new - comer started slightly , and Turnbull replied to the question on his face . "" Oh , yes ,"" he said , "" I am science !"" "" I congratulate you heartily ,"" answered the other , "" I am Doctor Quayle ."" Turnbull ' s eyes did not move , but he realized that the man in the panama hat had lost all his ease of a landed proprietor and had withdrawn to a distance of thirty yards , where he stood glaring with all the contraction of fear and hatred that can stiffen a cat . * * *"
chesterton#"MacIan was sitting somewhat disconsolately on a stump of tree , his large black head half buried in his large brown hands , when Turnbull strode up to him chewing a cigarette . He did not look up , but his comrade and enemy addressed him like one who must free himself of his feelings . "" Well , I hope , at any rate ,"" he said , "" that you like your precious religion now . I hope you like the society of this poor devil whom your damned tracts and hymns and priests have driven out of his wits . Five men in this place , they tell me , five men in this place who might have been fathers of families , and every one of them thinks he is God the Father . Oh !"
chesterton#"you may talk about the ugliness of science , but there is no one here who thinks he is Protoplasm ."" "" They naturally prefer a bright part ,"" said MacIan , wearily . "" Protoplasm is not worth going mad about ."" "" At least ,"" said Turnbull , savagely , "" it was your Jesus Christ who started all this bosh about being God ."" For one instant MacIan opened the eyes of battle ; then his tightened lips took a crooked smile and he said , quite calmly : "" No , the idea is older ; it was Satan who first said that he was God ."""
chesterton#""" Then , what ,"" asked Turnbull , very slowly , as he softly picked a flower , "" what is the difference between Christ and Satan ?"" "" It is quite simple ,"" replied the Highlander . "" Christ descended into hell ; Satan fell into it ."" "" Does it make much odds ?"" asked the free - thinker . "" It makes all the odds ,"" said the other ."
chesterton#""" One of them wanted to go up and went down ; the other wanted to go down and went up . A god can be humble , a devil can only be humbled ."" "" Why are you always wanting to humble a man ?"" asked Turnbull , knitting his brows . "" It affects me as ungenerous ."" "" Why were you wanting to humble a god when you found him in this garden ?"""
chesterton#"asked MacIan . "" That was an extreme case of impudence ,"" said Turnbull . "" Granting the man his almighty pretensions , I think he was very modest ,"" said MacIan . "" It is we who are arrogant , who know we are only men . The ordinary man in the street is more of a monster than that poor fellow ; for the man in the street treats himself as God Almighty when he knows he isn ' t . He expects the universe to turn round him , though he knows he isn ' t the centre ."""
chesterton#""" Well ,"" said Turnbull , sitting down on the grass , "" this is a digression , anyhow . What I want to point out is , that your faith does end in asylums and my science doesn ' t ."" "" Doesn ' t it , by George !"" cried MacIan , scornfully . "" There are a few men here who are mad on God and a few who are mad on the Bible . But I bet there are many more who are simply mad on madness ."""
chesterton#""" Do you really believe it ?"" asked the other . "" Scores of them , I should say ,"" answered MacIan . "" Fellows who have read medical books or fellows whose fathers and uncles had something hereditary in their heads -- the whole air they breathe is mad ."" "" All the same ,"" said Turnbull , shrewdly , "" I bet you haven ' t found a madman of that sort ."" "" I bet I have !"""
chesterton#"cried Evan , with unusual animation . "" I ' ve been walking about the garden talking to a poor chap all the morning . He ' s simply been broken down and driven raving by your damned science . Talk about believing one is God -- why , it ' s quite an old , comfortable , fireside fancy compared with the sort of things this fellow believes . He believes that there is a God , but that he is better than God . He says God will be afraid to face him ."
chesterton#"He says one is always progressing beyond the best . He put his arm in mine and whispered in my ear , as if it were the apocalypse : ' Never trust a God that you can ' t improve on .'"" "" What can he have meant ?"" said the atheist , with all his logic awake . "" Obviously one should not trust any God that one can improve on ."" "" It is the way he talks ,"" said MacIan , almost indifferently ; "" but he says rummier things than that ."
chesterton#"He says that a man ' s doctor ought to decide what woman he marries ; and he says that children ought not to be brought up by their parents , because a physical partiality will then distort the judgement of the educator ."" "" Oh , dear !"" said Turnbull , laughing , "" you have certainly come across a pretty bad case , and incidentally proved your own . I suppose some men do lose their wits through science as through love and other good things ."" "" And he says ,"" went on MacIan , monotonously , "" that he cannot see why anyone should suppose that a triangle is a three - sided figure . He says that on some higher plane ----"""
chesterton#"Turnbull leapt to his feet as by an electric shock . "" I never could have believed ,"" he cried , "" that you had humour enough to tell a lie . You ' ve gone a bit too far , old man , with your little joke . Even in a lunatic asylum there can ' t be anybody who , having thought about the matter , thinks that a triangle has not got three sides . If he exists he must be a new era in human psychology . But he doesn ' t exist ."""
chesterton#""" I will go and fetch him ,"" said MacIan , calmly ; "" I left the poor fellow wandering about by the nasturtium bed ."" MacIan vanished , and in a few moments returned , trailing with him his own discovery among lunatics , who was a slender man with a fixed smile and an unfixed and rolling head . He had a goatlike beard just long enough to be shaken in a strong wind . Turnbull sprang to his feet and was like one who is speechless through choking a sudden shout of laughter . "" Why , you great donkey ,"" he shouted , in an ear - shattering whisper , "" that ' s not one of the patients at all . That ' s one of the doctors ."""
chesterton#"Evan looked back at the leering head with the long - pointed beard and repeated the word inquiringly : "" One of the doctors ?"" "" Oh , you know what I mean ,"" said Turnbull , impatiently . "" The medical authorities of the place ."" Evan was still staring back curiously at the beaming and bearded creature behind him . "" The mad doctors ,"" said Turnbull , shortly . "" Quite so ,"" said MacIan ."
chesterton#"After a rather restless silence Turnbull plucked MacIan by the elbow and pulled him aside . "" For goodness sake ,"" he said , "" don ' t offend this fellow ; he may be as mad as ten hatters , if you like , but he has us between his finger and thumb . This is the very time he appointed to talk with us about our -- well , our exeat ."" "" But what can it matter ?"" asked the wondering MacIan . "" He can ' t keep us in the asylum ."
chesterton#"We ' re not mad ."" "" Jackass !"" said Turnbull , heartily , "" of course we ' re not mad . Of course , if we are medically examined and the thing is thrashed out , they will find we are not mad . But don ' t you see that if the thing is thrashed out it will mean letters to this reference and telegrams to that ; and at the first word of who we are , we shall be taken out of a madhouse , where we may smoke , to a jail , where we mayn ' t . No , if we manage this very quietly , he may merely let us out at the front door as stray revellers ."
chesterton#"If there ' s half an hour of inquiry , we are cooked ."" MacIan looked at the grass frowningly for a few seconds , and then said in a new , small and childish voice : "" I am awfully stupid , Mr . Turnbull ; you must be patient with me ."" Turnbull caught Evan ' s elbow again with quite another gesture . "" Come ,"" he cried , with the harsh voice of one who hides emotion , "" come and let us be tactful in chorus ."" The doctor with the pointed beard was already slanting it forward at a more than usually acute angle , with the smile that expressed expectancy . "" I hope I do not hurry you , gentlemen ,"" he said , with the faintest suggestion of a sneer at their hurried consultation , "" but I believe you wanted to see me at half past eleven ."""
chesterton#""" I am most awfully sorry , Doctor ,"" said Turnbull , with ready amiability ; "" I never meant to keep you waiting ; but the silly accident that has landed us in your garden may have some rather serious consequences to our friends elsewhere , and my friend here was just drawing my attention to some of them ."" "" Quite so ! Quite so !"" said the doctor , hurriedly . "" If you really want to put anything before me , I can give you a few moments in my consulting - room ."" He led them rapidly into a small but imposing apartment , which seemed to be built and furnished entirely in red - varnished wood ."
chesterton#"There was one desk occupied with carefully docketed papers ; and there were several chairs of the red - varnished wood -- though of different shape . All along the wall ran something that might have been a bookcase , only that it was not filled with books , but with flat , oblong slabs or cases of the same polished dark - red consistency . What those flat wooden cases were they could form no conception . The doctor sat down with a polite impatience on his professional perch ; MacIan remained standing , but Turnbull threw himself almost with luxury into a hard wooden arm - chair . "" This is a most absurd business , Doctor ,"" he said , "" and I am ashamed to take up the time of busy professional men with such pranks from outside . The plain fact is , that he and I and a pack of silly men and girls have organized a game across this part of the country -- a sort of combination of hare and hounds and hide and seek -- I dare say you ' ve heard of it ."
chesterton#"We are the hares , and , seeing your high wall look so inviting , we tumbled over it , and naturally were a little startled with what we found on the other side ."" "" Quite so !"" said the doctor , mildly . "" I can understand that you were startled ."" Turnbull had expected him to ask what place was the headquarters of the new exhilarating game , and who were the male and female enthusiasts who had brought it to such perfection ; in fact , Turnbull was busy making up these personal and topographical particulars . As the doctor did not ask the question , he grew slightly uneasy , and risked the question : "" I hope you will accept my assurance that the thing was an accident and that no intrusion was meant ."""
chesterton#""" Oh , yes , sir ,"" replied the doctor , smiling , "" I accept everything that you say ."" "" In that case ,"" said Turnbull , rising genially , "" we must not further interrupt your important duties . I suppose there will be someone to let us out ?"" "" No ,"" said the doctor , still smiling steadily and pleasantly , "" there will be no one to let you out ."" "" Can we let ourselves out , then ?"" asked Turnbull , in some surprise ."
chesterton#""" Why , of course not ,"" said the beaming scientist ; "" think how dangerous that would be in a place like this ."" "" Then , how the devil are we to get out ?"" cried Turnbull , losing his manners for the first time . "" It is a question of time , of receptivity , and treatment ,"" said the doctor , arching his eyebrows indifferently . "" I do not regard either of your cases as incurable ."" And with that the man of the world was struck dumb , and , as in all intolerable moments , the word was with the unworldly ."
chesterton#"MacIan took one stride to the table , leant across it , and said : "" We can ' t stop here , we ' re not mad people !"" "" We don ' t use the crude phrase ,"" said the doctor , smiling at his patent - leather boots . "" But you _can ' t_ think us mad ,"" thundered MacIan . "" You never saw us before . You know nothing about us . You haven ' t even examined us ."""
chesterton#"The doctor threw back his head and beard . "" Oh , yes ,"" he said , "" very thoroughly ."" "" But you can ' t shut a man up on your mere impressions without documents or certificates or anything ?"" The doctor got languidly to his feet . "" Quite so ,"" he said . "" You certainly ought to see the documents ."""
chesterton#"He went across to the curious mock book - shelves and took down one of the flat mahogany cases . This he opened with a curious key at his watch - chain , and laying back a flap revealed a quire of foolscap covered with close but quite clear writing . The first three words were in such large copy - book hand that they caught the eye even at a distance . They were : "" MacIan , Evan Stuart ."" Evan bent his angry eagle face over it ; yet something blurred it and he could never swear he saw it distinctly . He saw something that began : "" Prenatal influences predisposing to mania ."
chesterton#"Grandfather believed in return of the Stuarts . Mother carried bone of St . Eulalia with which she touched children in sickness . Marked religious mania at early age ----"" Evan fell back and fought for his speech . "" Oh !"" he burst out at last ."
chesterton#""" Oh ! if all this world I have walked in had been as sane as my mother was ."" Then he compressed his temples with his hands , as if to crush them . And then lifted suddenly a face that looked fresh and young , as if he had dipped and washed it in some holy well . "" Very well ,"" he cried ; "" I will take the sour with the sweet . I will pay the penalty of having enjoyed God in this monstrous modern earth that cannot enjoy man or beast ."
chesterton#I will die happy in your madhouse , only because I know what I know . Let it be granted , then -- MacIan is a mystic ; MacIan is a maniac . But this honest shopkeeper and editor whom I have dragged on my inhuman escapades , you cannot keep him . He will go free , thank God , he is not down in any damned document . His ancestor , I am certain , did not die at Culloden . His mother , I swear , had no relics .
chesterton#"Let my friend out of your front door , and as for me ----"" The doctor had already gone across to the laden shelves , and after a few minutes ' short - sighted peering , had pulled down another parallelogram of dark - red wood . This also he unlocked on the table , and with the same unerring egotistic eye on of the company saw the words , written in large letters : "" Turnbull , James ."" Hitherto Turnbull himself had somewhat scornfully surrendered his part in the whole business ; but he was too honest and unaffected not to start at his own name . After the name , the inscription appeared to run : "" Unique case of Eleutheromania . Parentage , as so often in such cases , prosaic and healthy ."
chesterton#"Eleutheromaniac signs occurred early , however , leading him to attach himself to the individualist Bradlaugh . Recent outbreak of pure anarchy ----"" Turnbull slammed the case to , almost smashing it , and said with a burst of savage laughter : "" Oh ! come along , MacIan ; I don ' t care so much , even about getting out of the madhouse , if only we get out of this room . You were right enough , MacIan , when you spoke about -- about mad doctors ."" Somehow they found themselves outside in the cool , green garden , and then , after a stunned silence , Turnbull said : "" There is one thing that was puzzling me all the time , and I understand it now ."""
chesterton#""" What do you mean ?"" asked Evan . "" No man by will or wit ,"" answered Turnbull , "" can get out of this garden ; and yet we got into it merely by jumping over a garden wall . The whole thing explains itself easily enough . That undefended wall was an open trap . It was a trap laid for two celebrated lunatics ."
chesterton#"They saw us get in right enough . And they will see that we do not get out ."" Evan gazed at the garden wall , gravely for more than a minute , and then he nodded without a word . XV . THE DREAM OF MACIAN The system of espionage in the asylum was so effective and complete that in practice the patients could often enjoy a sense of almost complete solitude ."
chesterton#They could stray up so near to the wall in an apparently unwatched garden as to find it easy to jump over it . They would only have found the error of their calculations if they had tried to jump . Under this insulting liberty , in this artificial loneliness , Evan MacIan was in the habit of creeping out into the garden after dark -- especially upon moonlight nights . The moon , indeed , was for him always a positive magnet in a manner somewhat hard to explain to those of a robuster attitude . Evidently , Apollo is to the full as poetical as Diana ; but it is not a question of poetry in the matured and intellectual sense of the word . It is a question of a certain solid and childish fancy .
chesterton#The sun is in the strict and literal sense invisible ; that is to say , that by our bodily eyes it cannot properly be seen . But the moon is a much simpler thing ; a naked and nursery sort of thing . It hangs in the sky quite solid and quite silver and quite useless ; it is one huge celestial snowball . It was at least some such infantile facts and fancies which led Evan again and again during his dehumanized imprisonment to go out as if to shoot the moon . He was out in the garden on one such luminous and ghostly night , when the steady moonshine toned down all the colours of the garden until almost the strongest tints to be seen were the strong soft blue of the sky and the large lemon moon . He was walking with his face turned up to it in that rather half - witted fashion which might have excused the error of his keepers ; and as he gazed he became aware of something little and lustrous flying close to the lustrous orb , like a bright chip knocked off the moon .
chesterton#At first he thought it was a mere sparkle or refraction in his own eyesight ; he blinked and cleared his eyes . Then he thought it was a falling star ; only it did not fall . It jerked awkwardly up and down in a way unknown among meteors and strangely reminiscent of the works of man . The next moment the thing drove right across the moon , and from being silver upon blue , suddenly became black upon silver ; then although it passed the field of light in a flash its outline was unmistakable though eccentric . It was a flying ship . The vessel took one long and sweeping curve across the sky and came nearer and nearer to MacIan , like a steam - engine coming round a bend .
chesterton#"It was of pure white steel , and in the moon it gleamed like the armour of Sir Galahad . The simile of such virginity is not inappropriate ; for , as it grew larger and larger and lower and lower , Evan saw that the only figure in it was robed in white from head to foot and crowned with snow - white hair , on which the moonshine lay like a benediction . The figure stood so still that he could easily have supposed it to be a statue . Indeed , he thought it was until it spoke . "" Evan ,"" said the voice , and it spoke with the simple authority of some forgotten father revisiting his children , "" you have remained here long enough , and your sword is wanted elsewhere ."" "" Wanted for what ?"""
chesterton#"asked the young man , accepting the monstrous event with a queer and clumsy naturalness ; "" what is my sword wanted for ?"" "" For all that you hold dear ,"" said the man standing in the moonlight ; "" for the thrones of authority and for all ancient loyalty to law ."" Evan looked up at the lunar orb again as if in irrational appeal -- a moon calf bleating to his mother the moon . But the face of Luna seemed as witless as his own ; there is no help in nature against the supernatural ; and he looked again at the tall marble figure that might have been made out of solid moonlight . Then he said in a loud voice : "" Who are you ?"" and the next moment was seized by a sort of choking terror lest his question should be answered ."
chesterton#"But the unknown preserved an impenetrable silence for a long space and then only answered : "" I must not say who I am until the end of the world ; but I may say what I am . I am the law ."" And he lifted his head so that the moon smote full upon his beautiful and ancient face . The face was the face of a Greek god grown old , but not grown either weak or ugly ; there was nothing to break its regularity except a rather long chin with a cleft in it , and this rather added distinction than lessened beauty . His strong , well - opened eyes were very brilliant but quite colourless like steel . MacIan was one of those to whom a reverence and self - submission in ritual come quite easy , and are ordinary things ."
chesterton#"It was not artificial in him to bend slightly to this solemn apparition or to lower his voice when he said : "" Do you bring me some message ?"" "" I do bring you a message ,"" answered the man of moon and marble . "" The king has returned ."" Evan did not ask for or require any explanation . "" I suppose you can take me to the war ,"" he said , and the silent silver figure only bowed its head again . MacIan clambered into the silver boat , and it rose upward to the stars ."
chesterton#"To say that it rose to the stars is no mere metaphor , for the sky had cleared to that occasional and astonishing transparency in which one can see plainly both stars and moon . As the white - robed figure went upward in his white chariot , he said quite quietly to Evan : "" There is an answer to all the folly talked about equality . Some stars are big and some small ; some stand still and some circle around them as they stand . They can be orderly , but they cannot be equal ."" "" They are all very beautiful ,"" said Evan , as if in doubt . "" They are all beautiful ,"" answered the other , "" because each is in his place and owns his superior ."
chesterton#"And now England will be beautiful after the same fashion . The earth will be as beautiful as the heavens , because our kings have come back to us ."" "" The Stuart ----"" began Evan , earnestly . "" Yes ,"" answered the old man , "" that which has returned is Stuart and yet older than Stuart . It is Capet and Plantagenet and Pendragon . It is all that good old time of which proverbs tell , that golden reign of Saturn against which gods and men were rebels ."
chesterton#"It is all that was ever lost by insolence and overwhelmed in rebellion . It is your own forefather , MacIan with the broken sword , bleeding without hope at Culloden . It is Charles refusing to answer the questions of the rebel court . It is Mary of the magic face confronting the gloomy and grasping peers and the boorish moralities of Knox . It is Richard , the last Plantagenet , giving his crown to Bolingbroke as to a common brigand . It is Arthur , overwhelmed in Lyonesse by heathen armies and dying in the mist , doubtful if ever he shall return ."""
chesterton#""" But now ----"" said Evan , in a low voice . "" But now !"" said the old man ; "" he has returned ."" "" Is the war still raging ?"" asked MacIan . "" It rages like the pit itself beyond the sea whither I am taking you ,"" answered the other ."
chesterton#""" But in England the king enjoys his own again . The people are once more taught and ruled as is best ; they are happy knights , happy squires , happy servants , happy serfs , if you will ; but free at last of that load of vexation and lonely vanity which was called being a citizen ."" "" Is England , indeed , so secure ?"" asked Evan . "" Look out and see ,"" said the guide . "" I fancy you have seen this place before ."""
chesterton#They were driving through the air towards one region of the sky where the hollow of night seemed darkest and which was quite without stars . But against this black background there sprang up , picked out in glittering silver , a dome and a cross . It seemed that it was really newly covered with silver , which in the strong moonlight was like white flame . But , however , covered or painted , Evan had no difficult in knowing the place again . He saw the great thoroughfare that sloped upward to the base of its huge pedestal of steps . And he wondered whether the little shop was still by the side of it and whether its window had been mended .
chesterton#As the flying ship swept round the dome he observed other alterations . The dome had been redecorated so as to give it a more solemn and somewhat more ecclesiastical note ; the ball was draped or destroyed , and round the gallery , under the cross , ran what looked like a ring of silver statues , like the little leaden images that stood round the hat of Louis XI . Round the second gallery , at the base of the dome , ran a second rank of such images , and Evan thought there was another round the steps below . When they came closer he saw that they were figures in complete armour of steel or silver , each with a naked sword , point upward ; and then he saw one of the swords move . These were not statues but an armed order of chivalry thrown in three circles round the cross . MacIan drew in his breath , as children do at anything they think utterly beautiful .
chesterton#For he could imagine nothing that so echoed his own visions of pontifical or chivalric art as this white dome sitting like a vast silver tiara over London , ringed with a triple crown of swords . As they went sailing down Ludgate Hill , Evan saw that the state of the streets fully answered his companion ' s claim about the reintroduction of order . All the old blackcoated bustle with its cockney vivacity and vulgarity had disappeared . Groups of labourers , quietly but picturesquely clad , were passing up and down in sufficiently large numbers ; but it required but a few mounted men to keep the streets in order . The mounted men were not common policemen , but knights with spurs and plume whose smooth and splendid armour glittered like diamond rather than steel . Only in one place -- at the corner of Bouverie Street -- did there appear to be a moment ' s confusion , and that was due to hurry rather than resistance .
chesterton#"But one old grumbling man did not get out of the way quick enough , and the man on horseback struck him , not severely , across the shoulders with the flat of his sword . "" The soldier had no business to do that ,"" said MacIan , sharply . "" The old man was moving as quickly as he could ."" "" We attach great importance to discipline in the streets ,"" said the man in white , with a slight smile . "" Discipline is not so important as justice ,"" said MacIan . The other did not answer ."
chesterton#"Then after a swift silence that took them out across St . James ' s Park , he said : "" The people must be taught to obey ; they must learn their own ignorance . And I am not sure ,"" he continued , turning his back on Evan and looking out of the prow of the ship into the darkness , "" I am not sure that I agree with your little maxim about justice . Discipline for the whole society is surely more important than justice to an individual ."" Evan , who was also leaning over the edge , swung round with startling suddenness and stared at the other ' s back . "" Discipline for society ----"" he repeated , very staccato , "" more important -- justice to individual ?"" Then after a long silence he called out : "" Who and what are you ?"""
chesterton#""" I am an angel ,"" said the white - robed figure , without turning round . "" You are not a Catholic ,"" said MacIan . The other seemed to take no notice , but reverted to the main topic . "" In our armies up in heaven we learn to put a wholesome fear into subordinates ."" MacIan sat craning his neck forward with an extraordinary and unaccountable eagerness . "" Go on !"""
chesterton#"he cried , twisting and untwisting his long , bony fingers , "" go on !"" "" Besides ,"" continued he , in the prow , "" you must allow for a certain high spirit and haughtiness in the superior type ."" "" Go on !"" said Evan , with burning eyes . "" Just as the sight of sin offends God ,"" said the unknown , "" so does the sight of ugliness offend Apollo . The beautiful and princely must , of necessity , be impatient with the squalid and ----"""
chesterton#""" Why , you great fool !"" cried MacIan , rising to the top of his tremendous stature , "" did you think I would have doubted only for that rap with a sword ? I know that noble orders have bad knights , that good knights have bad tempers , that the Church has rough priests and coarse cardinals ; I have known it ever since I was born . You fool ! you had only to say , ' Yes , it is rather a shame ,' and I should have forgotten the affair . But I saw on your mouth the twitch of your infernal sophistry ; I knew that something was wrong with you and your cathedrals ."
chesterton#"Something is wrong ; everything is wrong . You are not an angel . That is not a church . It is not the rightful king who has come home ."" "" That is unfortunate ,"" said the other , in a quiet but hard voice , "" because you are going to see his Majesty ."" "" No ,"" said MacIan , "" I am going to jump over the side ."""
chesterton#""" Do you desire death ?"" "" No ,"" said Evan , quite composedly , "" I desire a miracle ."" "" From whom do you ask it ? To whom do you appeal ?"" said his companion , sternly . "" You have betrayed the king , renounced his cross on the cathedral , and insulted an archangel ."""
chesterton#""" I appeal to God ,"" said Evan , and sprang up and stood upon the edge of the swaying ship . The being in the prow turned slowly round ; he looked at Evan with eyes which were like two suns , and put his hand to his mouth just too late to hide an awful smile . "" And how do you know ,"" he said , "" how do you know that I am not God ?"" MacIan screamed . "" Ah !"" he cried ."
chesterton#""" Now I know who you really are . You are not God . You are not one of God ' s angels . But you were once ."" The being ' s hand dropped from his mouth and Evan dropped out of the car . XVI ."
chesterton#THE DREAM OF TURNBULL Turnbull was walking rather rampantly up and down the garden on a gusty evening chewing his cigar and in that mood when every man suppresses an instinct to spit . He was not , as a rule , a man much acquainted with moods ; and the storms and sunbursts of MacIan ' s soul passed before him as an impressive but unmeaning panorama , like the anarchy of Highland scenery . Turnbull was one of those men in whom a continuous appetite and industry of the intellect leave the emotions very simple and steady . His heart was in the right place ; but he was quite content to leave it there . It was his head that was his hobby .
chesterton#His mornings and evenings were marked not by impulses or thirsty desires , not by hope or by heart - break ; they were filled with the fallacies he had detected , the problems he had made plain , the adverse theories he had wrestled with and thrown , the grand generalizations he had justified . But even the cheerful inner life of a logician may be upset by a lunatic asylum , to say nothing of whiffs of memory from a lady in Jersey , and the little red - bearded man on this windy evening was in a dangerous frame of mind . Plain and positive as he was , the influence of earth and sky may have been greater on him than he imagined ; and the weather that walked the world at that moment was as red and angry as Turnbull . Long strips and swirls of tattered and tawny cloud were dragged downward to the west exactly as torn red raiment would be dragged . And so strong and pitiless was the wind that it whipped away fragments of red - flowering bushes or of copper beech , and drove them also across the garden , a drift of red leaves , like the leaves of autumn , as in parody of the red and driven rags of cloud . There was a sense in earth and heaven as of everything breaking up , and all the revolutionist in Turnbull rejoiced that it was breaking up .
chesterton#The trees were breaking up under the wind , even in the tall strength of their bloom : the clouds were breaking up and losing even their large heraldic shapes . Shards and shreds of copper cloud split off continually and floated by themselves , and for some reason the truculent eye of Turnbull was attracted to one of these careering cloudlets , which seemed to him to career in an exaggerated manner . Also it kept its shape , which is unusual with clouds shaken off ; also its shape was of an odd sort . Turnbull continued to stare at it , and in a little time occurred that crucial instant when a thing , however incredible , is accepted as a fact . The copper cloud was tumbling down towards the earth , like some gigantic leaf from the copper beeches . And as it came nearer it was evident , first , that it was not a cloud , and , second , that it was not itself of the colour of copper ; only , being burnished like a mirror , it had reflected the red - brown colours of the burning clouds .
chesterton#As the thing whirled like a windswept leaf down towards the wall of the garden it was clear that it was some sort of air - ship made of metal , and slapping the air with big broad fins of steel . When it came about a hundred feet above the garden , a shaggy , lean figure leapt up in it , almost black against the bronze and scarlet of the west , and , flinging out a kind of hook or anchor , caught on to the green apple - tree just under the wall ; and from that fixed holding ground the ship swung in the red tempest like a captive balloon . While our friend stood frozen for an instant by his astonishment , the queer figure in the airy car tipped the vehicle almost upside down by leaping over the side of it , seemed to slide or drop down the rope like a monkey , and alighted ( with impossible precision and placidity ) seated on the edge of the wall , over which he kicked and dangled his legs as he grinned at Turnbull . The wind roared in the trees yet more ruinous and desolate , the red tails of the sunset were dragged downward like red dragons sucked down to death , and still on the top of the asylum wall sat the sinister figure with the grimace , swinging his feet in tune with the tempest ; while above him , at the end of its tossing or tightened cord , the enormous iron air - ship floated as light and as little noticed as a baby ' s balloon upon its string . Turnbull ' s first movement after sixty motionless seconds was to turn round and look at the large , luxuriant parallelogram of the garden and the long , low rectangular building beyond . There was not a soul or a stir of life within sight .
chesterton#And he had a quite meaningless sensation , as if there never really had been any one else there except he since the foundation of the world . Stiffening in himself the masculine but mirthless courage of the atheist , he drew a little nearer to the wall and , catching the man at a slightly different angle of the evening light , could see his face and figure quite plain . Two facts about him stood out in the picked colours of some piratical schoolboy ' s story . The first was that his lean brown body was bare to the belt of his loose white trousers ; the other that through hygiene , affectation , or whatever other cause , he had a scarlet handkerchief tied tightly but somewhat aslant across his brow . After these two facts had become emphatic , others appeared sufficiently important . One was that under the scarlet rag the hair was plentiful , but white as with the last snows of mortality .
chesterton#"Another was that under the mop of white and senile hair the face was strong , handsome , and smiling , with a well - cut profile and a long cloven chin . The length of this lower part of the face and the strange cleft in it ( which gave the man , in quite another sense from the common one , a double chin ) faintly spoilt the claim of the face to absolute regularity , but it greatly assisted it in wearing the expression of half - smiling and half - sneering arrogance with which it was staring at all the stones , all the flowers , but especially at the solitary man . "" What do you want ?"" shouted Turnbull . "" I want you , Jimmy ,"" said the eccentric man on the wall , and with the very word he had let himself down with a leap on to the centre of the lawn , where he bounded once literally like an India - rubber ball and then stood grinning with his legs astride . The only three facts that Turnbull could now add to his inventory were that the man had an ugly - looking knife swinging at his trousers belt , that his brown feet were as bare as his bronzed trunk and arms , and that his eyes had a singular bleak brilliancy which was of no particular colour ."
chesterton#""" Excuse my not being in evening dress ,"" said the newcomer with an urbane smile . "" We scientific men , you know -- I have to work my own engines -- electrical engineer -- very hot work ."" "" Look here ,"" said Turnbull , sturdily clenching his fists in his trousers pockets , "" I am bound to expect lunatics inside these four walls ; but I do bar their coming from outside , bang out of the sunset clouds ."" "" And yet you came from the outside , too , Jim ,"" said the stranger in a voice almost affectionate . "" What do you want ?"" asked Turnbull , with an explosion of temper as sudden as a pistol shot ."
chesterton#""" I have already told you ,"" said the man , lowering his voice and speaking with evident sincerity ; "" I want you ."" "" What do you want with me ?"" "" I want exactly what you want ,"" said the new - comer with a new gravity . "" I want the Revolution ."" Turnbull looked at the fire - swept sky and the wind - stricken woodlands , and kept on repeating the word voicelessly to himself -- the word that did indeed so thoroughly express his mood of rage as it had been among those red clouds and rocking tree - tops . "" Revolution !"""
chesterton#"he said to himself . "" The Revolution -- yes , that is what I want right enough -- anything , so long as it is a Revolution ."" To some cause he could never explain he found himself completing the sentence on the top of the wall , having automatically followed the stranger so far . But when the stranger silently indicated the rope that led to the machine , he found himself pausing and saying : "" I can ' t leave MacIan behind in this den ."" "" We are going to destroy the Pope and all the kings ,"" said the new - comer . "" Would it be wiser to take him with us ?"""
chesterton#"Somehow the muttering Turnbull found himself in the flying ship also , and it swung up into the sunset . "" All the great rebels have been very little rebels ,"" said the man with the red scarf . "" They have been like fourth - form boys who sometimes venture to hit a fifth - form boy . That was all the worth of their French Revolution and regicide . The boys never really dared to defy the schoolmaster ."" "" Whom do you mean by the schoolmaster ?"""
chesterton#"asked Turnbull . "" You know whom I mean ,"" answered the strange man , as he lay back on cushions and looked up into the angry sky . They seemed rising into stronger and stronger sunlight , as if it were sunrise rather than sunset . But when they looked down at the earth they saw it growing darker and darker . The lunatic asylum in its large rectangular grounds spread below them in a foreshortened and infantile plan , and looked for the first time the grotesque thing that it was . But the clear colours of the plan were growing darker every moment ."
chesterton#The masses of rose or rhododendron deepened from crimson to violet . The maze of gravel pathways faded from gold to brown . By the time they had risen a few hundred feet higher nothing could be seen of that darkening landscape except the lines of lighted windows , each one of which , at least , was the light of one lost intelligence . But on them as they swept upward better and braver winds seemed to blow , and on them the ruby light of evening seemed struck , and splashed like red spurts from the grapes of Dionysus . Below them the fallen lights were literally the fallen stars of servitude . And above them all the red and raging clouds were like the leaping flags of liberty .
chesterton#[ The Wisdom of Father Brown by G . K . Chesterton 1914 ] I . The Absence of Mr Glass THE consulting - rooms of Dr Orion Hood , the eminent criminologist and specialist in certain moral disorders , lay along the sea - front at Scarborough , in a series of very large and well - lighted french windows , which showed the North Sea like one endless outer wall of blue - green marble . In such a place the sea had something of the monotony of a blue - green dado : for the chambers themselves were ruled throughout by a terrible tidiness not unlike the terrible tidiness of the sea . It must not be supposed that Dr Hood ' s apartments excluded luxury , or even poetry .
chesterton#These things were there , in their place ; but one felt that they were never allowed out of their place . Luxury was there : there stood upon a special table eight or ten boxes of the best cigars ; but they were built upon a plan so that the strongest were always nearest the wall and the mildest nearest the window . A tantalus containing three kinds of spirit , all of a liqueur excellence , stood always on this table of luxury ; but the fanciful have asserted that the whisky , brandy , and rum seemed always to stand at the same level . Poetry was there : the left - hand corner of the room was lined with as complete a set of English classics as the right hand could show of English and foreign physiologists . But if one took a volume of Chaucer or Shelley from that rank , its absence irritated the mind like a gap in a man ' s front teeth . One could not say the books were never read ; probably they were , but there was a sense of their being chained to their places , like the Bibles in the old churches .
chesterton#Dr Hood treated his private book - shelf as if it were a public library . And if this strict scientific intangibility steeped even the shelves laden with lyrics and ballads and the tables laden with drink and tobacco , it goes without saying that yet more of such heathen holiness protected the other shelves that held the specialist ' s library , and the other tables that sustained the frail and even fairylike instruments of chemistry or mechanics . Dr Hood paced the length of his string of apartments , bounded -- as the boys ' geographies say -- on the east by the North Sea and on the west by the serried ranks of his sociological and criminologist library . He was clad in an artist ' s velvet , but with none of an artist ' s negligence ; his hair was heavily shot with grey , but growing thick and healthy ; his face was lean , but sanguine and expectant . Everything about him and his room indicated something at once rigid and restless , like that great northern sea by which ( on pure principles of hygiene ) he had built his home . Fate , being in a funny mood , pushed the door open and introduced into those long , strict , sea - flanked apartments one who was perhaps the most startling opposite of them and their master .
chesterton#In answer to a curt but civil summons , the door opened inwards and there shambled into the room a shapeless little figure , which seemed to find its own hat and umbrella as unmanageable as a mass of luggage . The umbrella was a black and prosaic bundle long past repair ; the hat was a broad - curved black hat , clerical but not common in England ; the man was the very embodiment of all that is homely and helpless . The doctor regarded the new - comer with a restrained astonishment , not unlike that he would have shown if some huge but obviously harmless sea - beast had crawled into his room . The new - comer regarded the doctor with that beaming but breathless geniality which characterizes a corpulent charwoman who has just managed to stuff herself into an omnibus . It is a rich confusion of social self - congratulation and bodily disarray . His hat tumbled to the carpet , his heavy umbrella slipped between his knees with a thud ; he reached after the one and ducked after the other , but with an unimpaired smile on his round face spoke simultaneously as follows :
chesterton#""" My name is Brown . Pray excuse me . I ' ve come about that business of the MacNabs . I have heard , you often help people out of such troubles . Pray excuse me if I am wrong ."" By this time he had sprawlingly recovered the hat , and made an odd little bobbing bow over it , as if setting everything quite right ."
chesterton#""" I hardly understand you ,"" replied the scientist , with a cold intensity of manner . "" I fear you have mistaken the chambers . I am Dr Hood , and my work is almost entirely literary and educational . It is true that I have sometimes been consulted by the police in cases of peculiar difficulty and importance , but --"" "" Oh , this is of the greatest importance ,"" broke in the little man called Brown . "" Why , her mother won ' t let them get engaged ."""
chesterton#"And he leaned back in his chair in radiant rationality . The brows of Dr Hood were drawn down darkly , but the eyes under them were bright with something that might be anger or might be amusement . "" And still ,"" he said , "" I do not quite understand ."" "" You see , they want to get married ,"" said the man with the clerical hat . "" Maggie MacNab and young Todhunter want to get married . Now , what can be more important than that ?"""
chesterton#"The great Orion Hood ' s scientific triumphs had deprived him of many things -- some said of his health , others of his God ; but they had not wholly despoiled him of his sense of the absurd . At the last plea of the ingenuous priest a chuckle broke out of him from inside , and he threw himself into an arm - chair in an ironical attitude of the consulting physician . "" Mr Brown ,"" he said gravely , "" it is quite fourteen and a half years since I was personally asked to test a personal problem : then it was the case of an attempt to poison the French President at a Lord Mayor ' s Banquet . It is now , I understand , a question of whether some friend of yours called Maggie is a suitable fiancee for some friend of hers called Todhunter . Well , Mr Brown , I am a sportsman . I will take it on ."
chesterton#"I will give the MacNab family my best advice , as good as I gave the French Republic and the King of England -- no , better : fourteen years better . I have nothing else to do this afternoon . Tell me your story ."" The little clergyman called Brown thanked him with unquestionable warmth , but still with a queer kind of simplicity . It was rather as if he were thanking a stranger in a smoking - room for some trouble in passing the matches , than as if he were ( as he was ) practically thanking the Curator of Kew Gardens for coming with him into a field to find a four - leaved clover . With scarcely a semi - colon after his hearty thanks , the little man began his recital :"
chesterton#""" I told you my name was Brown ; well , that ' s the fact , and I ' m the priest of the little Catholic Church I dare say you ' ve seen beyond those straggly streets , where the town ends towards the north . In the last and straggliest of those streets which runs along the sea like a sea - wall there is a very honest but rather sharp - tempered member of my flock , a widow called MacNab . She has one daughter , and she lets lodgings , and between her and the daughter , and between her and the lodgers -- well , I dare say there is a great deal to be said on both sides . At present she has only one lodger , the young man called Todhunter ; but he has given more trouble than all the rest , for he wants to marry the young woman of the house ."" "" And the young woman of the house ,"" asked Dr Hood , with huge and silent amusement , "" what does she want ?"" "" Why , she wants to marry him ,"" cried Father Brown , sitting up eagerly ."
chesterton#""" That is just the awful complication ."" "" It is indeed a hideous enigma ,"" said Dr Hood . "" This young James Todhunter ,"" continued the cleric , "" is a very decent man so far as I know ; but then nobody knows very much . He is a bright , brownish little fellow , agile like a monkey , clean - shaven like an actor , and obliging like a born courtier . He seems to have quite a pocketful of money , but nobody knows what his trade is . Mrs MacNab , therefore ( being of a pessimistic turn ), is quite sure it is something dreadful , and probably connected with dynamite ."
chesterton#The dynamite must be of a shy and noiseless sort , for the poor fellow only shuts himself up for several hours of the day and studies something behind a locked door . He declares his privacy is temporary and justified , and promises to explain before the wedding . That is all that anyone knows for certain , but Mrs MacNab will tell you a great deal more than even she is certain of . You know how the tales grow like grass on such a patch of ignorance as that . There are tales of two voices heard talking in the room ; though , when the door is opened , Todhunter is always found alone . There are tales of a mysterious tall man in a silk hat , who once came out of the sea - mists and apparently out of the sea , stepping softly across the sandy fields and through the small back garden at twilight , till he was heard talking to the lodger at his open window .
chesterton#"The colloquy seemed to end in a quarrel . Todhunter dashed down his window with violence , and the man in the high hat melted into the sea - fog again . This story is told by the family with the fiercest mystification ; but I really think Mrs MacNab prefers her own original tale : that the Other Man ( or whatever it is ) crawls out every night from the big box in the corner , which is kept locked all day . You see , therefore , how this sealed door of Todhunter ' s is treated as the gate of all the fancies and monstrosities of the ` Thousand and One Nights '. And yet there is the little fellow in his respectable black jacket , as punctual and innocent as a parlour clock . He pays his rent to the tick ; he is practically a teetotaller ; he is tirelessly kind with the younger children , and can keep them amused for a day on end ; and , last and most urgent of all , he has made himself equally popular with the eldest daughter , who is ready to go to church with him tomorrow ."""
chesterton#"A man warmly concerned with any large theories has always a relish for applying them to any triviality . The great specialist having condescended to the priest ' s simplicity , condescended expansively . He settled himself with comfort in his arm - chair and began to talk in the tone of a somewhat absent - minded lecturer : "" Even in a minute instance , it is best to look first to the main tendencies of Nature . A particular flower may not be dead in early winter , but the flowers are dying ; a particular pebble may never be wetted with the tide , but the tide is coming in . To the scientific eye all human history is a series of collective movements , destructions or migrations , like the massacre of flies in winter or the return of birds in spring ."
chesterton#Now the root fact in all history is Race . Race produces religion ; Race produces legal and ethical wars . There is no stronger case than that of the wild , unworldly and perishing stock which we commonly call the Celts , of whom your friends the MacNabs are specimens . Small , swarthy , and of this dreamy and drifting blood , they accept easily the superstitious explanation of any incidents , just as they still accept ( you will excuse me for saying ) that superstitious explanation of all incidents which you and your Church represent . It is not remarkable that such people , with the sea moaning behind them and the Church ( excuse me again ) droning in front of them , should put fantastic features into what are probably plain events . You , with your small parochial responsibilities , see only this particular Mrs MacNab , terrified with this particular tale of two voices and a tall man out of the sea .
chesterton#"But the man with the scientific imagination sees , as it were , the whole clans of MacNab scattered over the whole world , in its ultimate average as uniform as a tribe of birds . He sees thousands of Mrs MacNabs , in thousands of houses , dropping their little drop of morbidity in the tea - cups of their friends ; he sees --"" Before the scientist could conclude his sentence , another and more impatient summons sounded from without ; someone with swishing skirts was marshalled hurriedly down the corridor , and the door opened on a young girl , decently dressed but disordered and red - hot with haste . She had sea - blown blonde hair , and would have been entirely beautiful if her cheek - bones had not been , in the Scotch manner , a little high in relief as well as in colour . Her apology was almost as abrupt as a command . "" I ' m sorry to interrupt you , sir ,"" she said , "" but I had to follow Father Brown at once ; it ' s nothing less than life or death ."""
chesterton#"Father Brown began to get to his feet in some disorder . "" Why , what has happened , Maggie ?"" he said . "" James has been murdered , for all I can make out ,"" answered the girl , still breathing hard from her rush . "" That man Glass has been with him again ; I heard them talking through the door quite plain . Two separate voices : for James speaks low , with a burr , and the other voice was high and quavery ."""
chesterton#""" That man Glass ?"" repeated the priest in some perplexity . "" I know his name is Glass ,"" answered the girl , in great impatience . "" I heard it through the door . They were quarrelling -- about money , I think -- for I heard James say again and again , ` That ' s right , Mr Glass ,' or ` No , Mr Glass ,' and then , ` Two or three , Mr Glass .' But we ' re talking too much ; you must come at once , and there may be time yet ."""
chesterton#""" But time for what ?"" asked Dr Hood , who had been studying the young lady with marked interest . "" What is there about Mr Glass and his money troubles that should impel such urgency ?"" "" I tried to break down the door and couldn ' t ,"" answered the girl shortly , "" Then I ran to the back - yard , and managed to climb on to the window - sill that looks into the room . It was an dim , and seemed to be empty , but I swear I saw James lying huddled up in a corner , as if he were drugged or strangled ."" "" This is very serious ,"" said Father Brown , gathering his errant hat and umbrella and standing up ; "" in point of fact I was just putting your case before this gentleman , and his view --"""
chesterton#""" Has been largely altered ,"" said the scientist gravely . "" I do not think this young lady is so Celtic as I had supposed . As I have nothing else to do , I will put on my hat and stroll down town with you ."" In a few minutes all three were approaching the dreary tail of the MacNabs ' street : the girl with the stern and breathless stride of the mountaineer , the criminologist with a lounging grace ( which was not without a certain leopard - like swiftness ), and the priest at an energetic trot entirely devoid of distinction . The aspect of this edge of the town was not entirely without justification for the doctor ' s hints about desolate moods and environments . The scattered houses stood farther and farther apart in a broken string along the seashore ; the afternoon was closing with a premature and partly lurid twilight ; the sea was of an inky purple and murmuring ominously ."
chesterton#In the scrappy back garden of the MacNabs which ran down towards the sand , two black , barren - looking trees stood up like demon hands held up in astonishment , and as Mrs MacNab ran down the street to meet them with lean hands similarly spread , and her fierce face in shadow , she was a little like a demon herself . The doctor and the priest made scant reply to her shrill reiterations of her daughter ' s story , with more disturbing details of her own , to the divided vows of vengeance against Mr Glass for murdering , and against Mr Todhunter for being murdered , or against the latter for having dared to want to marry her daughter , and for not having lived to do it . They passed through the narrow passage in the front of the house until they came to the lodger ' s door at the back , and there Dr Hood , with the trick of an old detective , put his shoulder sharply to the panel and burst in the door . It opened on a scene of silent catastrophe . No one seeing it , even for a flash , could doubt that the room had been the theatre of some thrilling collision between two , or perhaps more , persons . Playing - cards lay littered across the table or fluttered about the floor as if a game had been interrupted .
chesterton#Two wine glasses stood ready for wine on a side - table , but a third lay smashed in a star of crystal upon the carpet . A few feet from it lay what looked like a long knife or short sword , straight , but with an ornamental and pictured handle , its dull blade just caught a grey glint from the dreary window behind , which showed the black trees against the leaden level of the sea . Towards the opposite corner of the room was rolled a gentleman ' s silk top hat , as if it had just been knocked off his head ; so much so , indeed , that one almost looked to see it still rolling . And in the corner behind it , thrown like a sack of potatoes , but corded like a railway trunk , lay Mr James Todhunter , with a scarf across his mouth , and six or seven ropes knotted round his elbows and ankles . His brown eyes were alive and shifted alertly . Dr Orion Hood paused for one instant on the doormat and drank in the whole scene of voiceless violence .
chesterton#"Then he stepped swiftly across the carpet , picked up the tall silk hat , and gravely put it upon the head of the yet pinioned Todhunter . It was so much too large for him that it almost slipped down on to his shoulders . "" Mr Glass ' s hat ,"" said the doctor , returning with it and peering into the inside with a pocket lens . "" How to explain the absence of Mr Glass and the presence of Mr Glass ' s hat ? For Mr Glass is not a careless man with his clothes . That hat is of a stylish shape and systematically brushed and burnished , though not very new ."
chesterton#"An old dandy , I should think ."" "" But , good heavens !"" called out Miss MacNab , "" aren ' t you going to untie the man first ?"" "" I say ` old ' with intention , though not with certainty "" continued the expositor ; "" my reason for it might seem a little far - fetched . The hair of human beings falls out in very varying degrees , but almost always falls out slightly , and with the lens I should see the tiny hairs in a hat recently worn . It has none , which leads me to guess that Mr Glass is bald ."
chesterton#"Now when this is taken with the high - pitched and querulous voice which Miss MacNab described so vividly ( patience , my dear lady , patience ), when we take the hairless head together with the tone common in senile anger , I should think we may deduce some advance in years . Nevertheless , he was probably vigorous , and he was almost certainly tall . I might rely in some degree on the story of his previous appearance at the window , as a tall man in a silk hat , but I think I have more exact indication . This wineglass has been smashed all over the place , but one of its splinters lies on the high bracket beside the mantelpiece . No such fragment could have fallen there if the vessel had been smashed in the hand of a comparatively short man like Mr Todhunter ."" "" By the way ,"" said Father Brown , "" might it not be as well to untie Mr Todhunter ?"""
chesterton#""" Our lesson from the drinking - vessels does not end here ,"" proceeded the specialist . "" I may say at once that it is possible that the man Glass was bald or nervous through dissipation rather than age . Mr Todhunter , as has been remarked , is a quiet thrifty gentleman , essentially an abstainer . These cards and wine - cups are no part of his normal habit ; they have been produced for a particular companion . But , as it happens , we may go farther . Mr Todhunter may or may not possess this wine - service , but there is no appearance of his possessing any wine ."
chesterton#"What , then , were these vessels to contain ? I would at once suggest some brandy or whisky , perhaps of a luxurious sort , from a flask in the pocket of Mr Glass . We have thus something like a picture of the man , or at least of the type : tall , elderly , fashionable , but somewhat frayed , certainly fond of play and strong waters , perhaps rather too fond of them Mr Glass is a gentleman not unknown on the fringes of society ."" "" Look here ,"" cried the young woman , "" if you don ' t let me pass to untie him I ' ll run outside and scream for the police ."" "" I should not advise you , Miss MacNab ,"" said Dr Hood gravely , "" to be in any hurry to fetch the police . Father Brown , I seriously ask you to compose your flock , for their sakes , not for mine ."
chesterton#"Well , we have seen something of the figure and quality of Mr Glass ; what are the chief facts known of Mr Todhunter ? They are substantially three : that he is economical , that he is more or less wealthy , and that he has a secret . Now , surely it is obvious that there are the three chief marks of the kind of man who is blackmailed . And surely it is equally obvious that the faded finery , the profligate habits , and the shrill irritation of Mr Glass are the unmistakable marks of the kind of man who blackmails him . We have the two typical figures of a tragedy of hush money : on the one hand , the respectable man with a mystery ; on the other , the West - end vulture with a scent for a mystery . These two men have met here today and have quarrelled , using blows and a bare weapon ."""
chesterton#""" Are you going to take those ropes off ?"" asked the girl stubbornly . Dr Hood replaced the silk hat carefully on the side table , and went across to the captive . He studied him intently , even moving him a little and half - turning him round by the shoulders , but he only answered : "" No ; I think these ropes will do very well till your friends the police bring the handcuffs ."" Father Brown , who had been looking dully at the carpet , lifted his round face and said : "" What do you mean ?"""
chesterton#"The man of science had picked up the peculiar dagger - sword from the carpet and was examining it intently as he answered : "" Because you find Mr Todhunter tied up ,"" he said , "" you all jump to the conclusion that Mr Glass had tied him up ; and then , I suppose , escaped . There are four objections to this : First , why should a gentleman so dressy as our friend Glass leave his hat behind him , if he left of his own free will ? Second ,"" he continued , moving towards the window , "" this is the only exit , and it is locked on the inside . Third , this blade here has a tiny touch of blood at the point , but there is no wound on Mr Todhunter . Mr Glass took that wound away with him , dead or alive ."
chesterton#"Add to all this primary probability . It is much more likely that the blackmailed person would try to kill his incubus , rather than that the blackmailer would try to kill the goose that lays his golden egg . There , I think , we have a pretty complete story ."" "" But the ropes ?"" inquired the priest , whose eyes had remained open with a rather vacant admiration . "" Ah , the ropes ,"" said the expert with a singular intonation ."
chesterton#""" Miss MacNab very much wanted to know why I did not set Mr Todhunter free from his ropes . Well , I will tell her . I did not do it because Mr Todhunter can set himself free from them at any minute he chooses ."" "" What ?"" cried the audience on quite different notes of astonishment . "" I have looked at all the knots on Mr Todhunter ,"" reiterated Hood quietly ."
chesterton#""" I happen to know something about knots ; they are quite a branch of criminal science . Every one of those knots he has made himself and could loosen himself ; not one of them would have been made by an enemy really trying to pinion him . The whole of this affair of the ropes is a clever fake , to make us think him the victim of the struggle instead of the wretched Glass , whose corpse may be hidden in the garden or stuffed up the chimney ."" There was a rather depressed silence ; the room was darkening , the sea - blighted boughs of the garden trees looked leaner and blacker than ever , yet they seemed to have come nearer to the window . One could almost fancy they were sea - monsters like krakens or cuttlefish , writhing polypi who had crawled up from the sea to see the end of this tragedy , even as he , the villain and victim of it , the terrible man in the tall hat , had once crawled up from the sea . For the whole air was dense with the morbidity of blackmail , which is the most morbid of human things , because it is a crime concealing a crime ; a black plaster on a blacker wound ."
chesterton#"The face of the little Catholic priest , which was commonly complacent and even comic , had suddenly become knotted with a curious frown . It was not the blank curiosity of his first innocence . It was rather that creative curiosity which comes when a man has the beginnings of an idea . "" Say it again , please ,"" he said in a simple , bothered manner ; "" do you mean that Todhunter can tie himself up all alone and untie himself all alone ?"" "" That is what I mean ,"" said the doctor . "" Jerusalem !"""
chesterton#"ejaculated Brown suddenly , "" I wonder if it could possibly be that !"" He scuttled across the room rather like a rabbit , and peered with quite a new impulsiveness into the partially - covered face of the captive . Then he turned his own rather fatuous face to the company . "" Yes , that ' s it !"" he cried in a certain excitement . "" Can ' t you see it in the man ' s face ?"
chesterton#"Why , look at his eyes !"" Both the Professor and the girl followed the direction of his glance . And though the broad black scarf completely masked the lower half of Todhunter ' s visage , they did grow conscious of something struggling and intense about the upper part of it . "" His eyes do look queer ,"" cried the young woman , strongly moved . "" You brutes ; I believe it ' s hurting him !"" "" Not that , I think ,"" said Dr Hood ; "" the eyes have certainly a singular expression ."
chesterton#"But I should interpret those transverse wrinkles as expressing rather such slight psychological abnormality --"" "" Oh , bosh !"" cried Father Brown : "" can ' t you see he ' s laughing ?"" "" Laughing !"" repeated the doctor , with a start ; "" but what on earth can he be laughing at ?"" "" Well ,"" replied the Reverend Brown apologetically , "" not to put too fine a point on it , I think he is laughing at you ."
chesterton#"And indeed , I ' m a little inclined to laugh at myself , now I know about it ."" "" Now you know about what ?"" asked Hood , in some exasperation . "" Now I know ,"" replied the priest , "" the profession of Mr Todhunter ."" He shuffled about the room , looking at one object after another with what seemed to be a vacant stare , and then invariably bursting into an equally vacant laugh , a highly irritating process for those who had to watch it . He laughed very much over the hat , still more uproariously over the broken glass , but the blood on the sword point sent him into mortal convulsions of amusement ."
chesterton#"Then he turned to the fuming specialist . "" Dr Hood ,"" he cried enthusiastically , "" you are a great poet ! You have called an uncreated being out of the void . How much more godlike that is than if you had only ferreted out the mere facts ! Indeed , the mere facts are rather commonplace and comic by comparison ."" "" I have no notion what you are talking about ,"" said Dr Hood rather haughtily ; "" my facts are all inevitable , though necessarily incomplete ."
chesterton#"A place may be permitted to intuition , perhaps ( or poetry if you prefer the term ), but only because the corresponding details cannot as yet be ascertained . In the absence of Mr Glass --"" "" That ' s it , that ' s it ,"" said the little priest , nodding quite eagerly , "" that ' s the first idea to get fixed ; the absence of Mr Glass . He is so extremely absent . I suppose ,"" he added reflectively , "" that there was never anybody so absent as Mr Glass ."" "" Do you mean he is absent from the town ?"""
chesterton#"demanded the doctor . "" I mean he is absent from everywhere ,"" answered Father Brown ; "" he is absent from the Nature of Things , so to speak ."" "" Do you seriously mean ,"" said the specialist with a smile , "" that there is no such person ?"" The priest made a sign of assent . "" It does seem a pity ,"" he said . Orion Hood broke into a contemptuous laugh ."
chesterton#""" Well ,"" he said , "" before we go on to the hundred and one other evidences , let us take the first proof we found ; the first fact we fell over when we fell into this room . If there is no Mr Glass , whose hat is this ?"" "" It is Mr Todhunter ' s ,"" replied Father Brown . "" But it doesn ' t fit him ,"" cried Hood impatiently . "" He couldn ' t possibly wear it !"" Father Brown shook his head with ineffable mildness ."
chesterton#""" I never said he could wear it ,"" he answered . "" I said it was his hat . Or , if you insist on a shade of difference , a hat that is his ."" "" And what is the shade of difference ?"" asked the criminologist with a slight sneer . "" My good sir ,"" cried the mild little man , with his first movement akin to impatience , "" if you will walk down the street to the nearest hatter ' s shop , you will see that there is , in common speech , a difference between a man ' s hat and the hats that are his ."""
chesterton#""" But a hatter ,"" protested Hood , "" can get money out of his stock of new hats . What could Todhunter get out of this one old hat ?"" "" Rabbits ,"" replied Father Brown promptly . "" What ?"" cried Dr Hood . "" Rabbits , ribbons , sweetmeats , goldfish , rolls of coloured paper ,"" said the reverend gentleman with rapidity ."
chesterton#""" Didn ' t you see it all when you found out the faked ropes ? It ' s just the same with the sword . Mr Todhunter hasn ' t got a scratch on him , as you say ; but he ' s got a scratch in him , if you follow me ."" "" Do you mean inside Mr Todhunter ' s clothes ?"" inquired Mrs MacNab sternly . "" I do not mean inside Mr Todhunter ' s clothes ,"" said Father Brown ."
chesterton#""" I mean inside Mr Todhunter ."" "" Well , what in the name of Bedlam do you mean ?"" "" Mr Todhunter ,"" explained Father Brown placidly , "" is learning to be a professional conjurer , as well as juggler , ventriloquist , and expert in the rope trick . The conjuring explains the hat . It is without traces of hair , not because it is worn by the prematurely bald Mr Glass , but because it has never been worn by anybody . The juggling explains the three glasses , which Todhunter was teaching himself to throw up and catch in rotation ."
chesterton#But , being only at the stage of practice , he smashed one glass against the ceiling . And the juggling also explains the sword , which it was Mr Todhunter ' s professional pride and duty to swallow . But , again , being at the stage of practice , he very slightly grazed the inside of his throat with the weapon . Hence he has a wound inside him , which I am sure ( from the expression on his face ) is not a serious one . He was also practising the trick of a release from ropes , like the Davenport Brothers , and he was just about to free himself when we all burst into the room . The cards , of course , are for card tricks , and they are scattered on the floor because he had just been practising one of those dodges of sending them flying through the air .
chesterton#"He merely kept his trade secret , because he had to keep his tricks secret , like any other conjurer . But the mere fact of an idler in a top hat having once looked in at his back window , and been driven away by him with great indignation , was enough to set us all on a wrong track of romance , and make us imagine his whole life overshadowed by the silk - hatted spectre of Mr Glass ."" "" But What about the two voices ?"" asked Maggie , staring . "" Have you never heard a ventriloquist ?"" asked Father Brown ."
chesterton#""" Don ' t you know they speak first in their natural voice , and then answer themselves in just that shrill , squeaky , unnatural voice that you heard ?"" There was a long silence , and Dr Hood regarded the little man who had spoken with a dark and attentive smile . "" You are certainly a very ingenious person ,"" he said ; "" it could not have been done better in a book . But there is just one part of Mr Glass you have not succeeded in explaining away , and that is his name . Miss MacNab distinctly heard him so addressed by Mr Todhunter ."" The Rev ."
chesterton#"Mr Brown broke into a rather childish giggle . "" Well , that ,"" he said , "" that ' s the silliest part of the whole silly story . When our juggling friend here threw up the three glasses in turn , he counted them aloud as he caught them , and also commented aloud when he failed to catch them . What he really said was : ` One , two and three -- missed a glass one , two -- missed a glass .' And so on ."" There was a second of stillness in the room , and then everyone with one accord burst out laughing ."
chesterton#As they did so the figure in the corner complacently uncoiled all the ropes and let them fall with a flourish . Then , advancing into the middle of the room with a bow , he produced from his pocket a big bill printed in blue and red , which announced that ZALADIN , the World ' s Greatest Conjurer , Contortionist , Ventriloquist and Human Kangaroo would be ready with an entirely new series of Tricks at the Empire Pavilion , Scarborough , on Monday next at eight o ' clock precisely . II . The Paradise of Thieves THE great Muscari , most original of the young Tuscan poets , walked swiftly into his favourite restaurant , which overlooked the Mediterranean , was covered by an awning and fenced by little lemon and orange trees . Waiters in white aprons were already laying out on white tables the insignia of an early and elegant lunch ; and this seemed to increase a satisfaction that already touched the top of swagger .
chesterton#Muscari had an eagle nose like Dante ; his hair and neckerchief were dark and flowing ; he carried a black cloak , and might almost have carried a black mask , so much did he bear with him a sort of Venetian melodrama . He acted as if a troubadour had still a definite social office , like a bishop . He went as near as his century permitted to walking the world literally like Don Juan , with rapier and guitar . For he never travelled without a case of swords , with which he had fought many brilliant duels , or without a corresponding case for his mandolin , with which he had actually serenaded Miss Ethel Harrogate , the highly conventional daughter of a Yorkshire banker on a holiday . Yet he was neither a charlatan nor a child ; but a hot , logical Latin who liked a certain thing and was it . His poetry was as straightforward as anyone else ' s prose .
chesterton#He desired fame or wine or the beauty of women with a torrid directness inconceivable among the cloudy ideals or cloudy compromises of the north ; to vaguer races his intensity smelt of danger or even crime . Like fire or the sea , he was too simple to be trusted . The banker and his beautiful English daughter were staying at the hotel attached to Muscari ' s restaurant ; that was why it was his favourite restaurant . A glance flashed around the room told him at once , however , that the English party had not descended . The restaurant was glittering , but still comparatively empty . Two priests were talking at a table in a corner , but Muscari ( an ardent Catholic ) took no more notice of them than of a couple of crows .
chesterton#But from a yet farther seat , partly concealed behind a dwarf tree golden with oranges , there rose and advanced towards the poet a person whose costume was the most aggressively opposite to his own . This figure was clad in tweeds of a piebald check , with a pink tie , a sharp collar and protuberant yellow boots . He contrived , in the true tradition of ' Arry at Margate , to look at once startling and commonplace . But as the Cockney apparition drew nearer , Muscari was astounded to observe that the head was distinctly different from the body . It was an Italian head : fuzzy , swarthy and very vivacious , that rose abruptly out of the standing collar like cardboard and the comic pink tie . In fact it was a head he knew .
chesterton#"He recognized it , above all the dire erection of English holiday array , as the face of an old but forgotten friend name Ezza . This youth had been a prodigy at college , and European fame was promised him when he was barely fifteen ; but when he appeared in the world he failed , first publicly as a dramatist and a demagogue , and then privately for years on end as an actor , a traveller , a commission agent or a journalist . Muscari had known him last behind the footlights ; he was but too well attuned to the excitements of that profession , and it was believed that some moral calamity had swallowed him up . "" Ezza !"" cried the poet , rising and shaking hands in a pleasant astonishment . "" Well , I ' ve seen you in many costumes in the green room ; but I never expected to see you dressed up as an Englishman ."""
chesterton#""" This ,"" answered Ezza gravely , "" is not the costume of an Englishman , but of the Italian of the future ."" "" In that case ,"" remarked Muscari , "" I confess I prefer the Italian of the past ."" "" That is your old mistake , Muscari ,"" said the man in tweeds , shaking his head ; "" and the mistake of Italy . In the sixteenth century we Tuscans made the morning : we had the newest steel , the newest carving , the newest chemistry . Why should we not now have the newest factories , the newest motors , the newest finance -- the newest clothes ?"" "" Because they are not worth having ,"" answered Muscari ."
chesterton#""" You cannot make Italians really progressive ; they are too intelligent . Men who see the short cut to good living will never go by the new elaborate roads ."" "" Well , to me Marconi , or D ' Annunzio , is the star of Italy "" said the other . "" That is why I have become a Futurist -- and a courier ."" "" A courier !"" cried Muscari , laughing ."
chesterton#""" Is that the last of your list of trades ? And whom are you conducting ?"" "" Oh , a man of the name of Harrogate , and his family , I believe ."" "" Not the banker in this hotel ?"" inquired the poet , with some eagerness . "" That ' s the man ,"" answered the courier ."
chesterton#""" Does it pay well ?"" asked the troubadour innocently . "" It will pay me ,"" said Ezza , with a very enigmatic smile . "" But I am a rather curious sort of courier ."" Then , as if changing the subject , he said abruptly : "" He has a daughter -- and a son ."" "" The daughter is divine ,"" affirmed Muscari , "" the father and son are , I suppose , human ."
chesterton#But granted his harmless qualities doesn ' t that banker strike you as a splendid instance of my argument ? Harrogate has millions in his safes , and I have -- the hole in my pocket . But you daren ' t say -- you can ' t say -- that he ' s cleverer than I , or bolder than I , or even more energetic . He ' s not clever , he ' s got eyes like blue buttons ; he ' s not energetic , he moves from chair to chair like a paralytic . He ' s a conscientious , kindly old blockhead ; but he ' s got money simply because he collects money , as a boy collects stamps . You ' re too strong - minded for business , Ezza .
chesterton#"You won ' t get on . To be clever enough to get all that money , one must be stupid enough to want it ."" "" I ' m stupid enough for that ,"" said Ezza gloomily . "" But I should suggest a suspension of your critique of the banker , for here he comes ."" Mr Harrogate , the great financier , did indeed enter the room , but nobody looked at him . He was a massive elderly man with a boiled blue eye and faded grey - sandy moustaches ; but for his heavy stoop he might have been a colonel ."
chesterton#He carried several unopened letters in his hand . His son Frank was a really fine lad , curly - haired , sun - burnt and strenuous ; but nobody looked at him either . All eyes , as usual , were riveted , for the moment at least , upon Ethel Harrogate , whose golden Greek head and colour of the dawn seemed set purposely above that sapphire sea , like a goddess ' s . The poet Muscari drew a deep breath as if he were drinking something , as indeed he was . He was drinking the Classic ; which his fathers made . Ezza studied her with a gaze equally intense and far more baffling .
chesterton#Miss Harrogate was specially radiant and ready for conversation on this occasion ; and her family had fallen into the easier Continental habit , allowing the stranger Muscari and even the courier Ezza to share their table and their talk . In Ethel Harrogate conventionality crowned itself with a perfection and splendour of its own . Proud of her father ' s prosperity , fond of fashionable pleasures , a fond daughter but an arrant flirt , she was all these things with a sort of golden good - nature that made her very pride pleasing and her worldly respectability a fresh and hearty thing . They were in an eddy of excitement about some alleged peril in the mountain path they were to attempt that week . The danger was not from rock and avalanche , but from something yet more romantic . Ethel had been earnestly assured that brigands , the true cut - throats of the modern legend , still haunted that ridge and held that pass of the Apennines .
chesterton#""" They say ,"" she cried , with the awful relish of a schoolgirl , "" that all that country isn ' t ruled by the King of Italy , but by the King of Thieves . Who is the King of Thieves ?"" "" A great man ,"" replied Muscari , "" worthy to rank with your own Robin Hood , signorina . Montano , the King of Thieves , was first heard of in the mountains some ten years ago , when people said brigands were extinct . But his wild authority spread with the swiftness of a silent revolution . Men found his fierce proclamations nailed in every mountain village ; his sentinels , gun in hand , in every mountain ravine ."
chesterton#"Six times the Italian Government tried to dislodge him , and was defeated in six pitched battles as if by Napoleon ."" "" Now that sort of thing ,"" observed the banker weightily , "" would never be allowed in England ; perhaps , after all , we had better choose another route . But the courier thought it perfectly safe ."" "" It is perfectly safe ,"" said the courier contemptuously . "" I have been over it twenty times . There may have been some old jailbird called a King in the time of our grandmothers ; but he belongs to history if not to fable ."
chesterton#"Brigandage is utterly stamped out ."" "" It can never be utterly stamped out ,"" Muscari answered ; "" because armed revolt is a recreation natural to southerners . Our peasants are like their mountains , rich in grace and green gaiety , but with the fires beneath . There is a point of human despair where the northern poor take to drink -- and our own poor take to daggers ."" "" A poet is privileged ,"" replied Ezza , with a sneer . "" If Signor Muscari were English be would still be looking for highwaymen in Wandsworth ."
chesterton#"Believe me , there is no more danger of being captured in Italy than of being scalped in Boston ."" "" Then you propose to attempt it ?"" asked Mr Harrogate , frowning . "" Oh , it sounds rather dreadful ,"" cried the girl , turning her glorious eyes on Muscari . "" Do you really think the pass is dangerous ?"" Muscari threw back his black mane ."
chesterton#""" I know it is dangerous :"" he said . "" I am crossing it tomorrow ."" The young Harrogate was left behind for a moment emptying a glass of white wine and lighting a cigarette , as the beauty retired with the banker , the courier and the poet , distributing peals of silvery satire . At about the same instant the two priests in the corner rose ; the taller , a white - haired Italian , taking his leave . The shorter priest turned and walked towards the banker ' s son , and the latter was astonished to realize that though a Roman priest the man was an Englishman . He vaguely remembered meeting him at the social crushes of some of his Catholic friends ."
chesterton#"But the man spoke before his memories could collect themselves . "" Mr Frank Harrogate , I think ,"" he said . "" I have had an introduction , but I do not mean to presume on it . The odd thing I have to say will come far better from a stranger . Mr Harrogate , I say one word and go : take care of your sister in her great sorrow ."" Even for Frank ' s truly fraternal indifference the radiance and derision of his sister still seemed to sparkle and ring ; he could hear her laughter still from the garden of the hotel , and he stared at his sombre adviser in puzzledom ."
chesterton#""" Do you mean the brigands ?"" he asked ; and then , remembering a vague fear of his own , "" or can you be thinking of Muscari ?"" "" One is never thinking of the real sorrow ,"" said the strange priest . "" One can only be kind when it comes ."" And he passed promptly from the room , leaving the other almost with his mouth open . A day or two afterwards a coach containing the company was really crawling and staggering up the spurs of the menacing mountain range ."
chesterton#Between Ezza ' s cheery denial of the danger and Muscari ' s boisterous defiance of it , the financial family were firm in their original purpose ; and Muscari made his mountain journey coincide with theirs . A more surprising feature was the appearance at the coast - town station of the little priest of the restaurant ; he alleged merely that business led him also to cross the mountains of the midland . But young Harrogate could not but connect his presence with the mystical fears and warnings of yesterday . The coach was a kind of commodious wagonette , invented by the modernist talent of the courier , who dominated the expedition with his scientific activity and breezy wit . The theory of danger from thieves was banished from thought and speech ; though so far conceded in formal act that some slight protection was employed . The courier and the young banker carried loaded revolvers , and Muscari ( with much boyish gratification ) buckled on a kind of cutlass under his black cloak .
chesterton#He had planted his person at a flying leap next to the lovely Englishwoman ; on the other side of her sat the priest , whose name was Brown and who was fortunately a silent individual ; the courier and the father and son were on the banc behind . Muscari was in towering spirits , seriously believing in the peril , and his talk to Ethel might well have made her think him a maniac . But there was something in the crazy and gorgeous ascent , amid crags like peaks loaded with woods like orchards , that dragged her spirit up alone with his into purple preposterous heavens with wheeling suns . The white road climbed like a white cat ; it spanned sunless chasms like a tight - rope ; it was flung round far - off headlands like a lasso . And yet , however high they went , the desert still blossomed like the rose . The fields were burnished in sun and wind with the colour of kingfisher and parrot and humming - bird , the hues of a hundred flowering flowers .
chesterton#"There are no lovelier meadows and woodlands than the English , no nobler crests or chasms than those of Snowdon and Glencoe . But Ethel Harrogate had never before seen the southern parks tilted on the splintered northern peaks ; the gorge of Glencoe laden with the fruits of Kent . There was nothing here of that chill and desolation that in Britain one associates with high and wild scenery . It was rather like a mosaic palace , rent with earthquakes ; or like a Dutch tulip garden blown to the stars with dynamite . "" It ' s like Kew Gardens on Beachy Head ,"" said Ethel . "" It is our secret ,"" answered he , "" the secret of the volcano ; that is also the secret of the revolution -- that a thing can be violent and yet fruitful ."""
chesterton#""" You are rather violent yourself ,"" and she smiled at him . "" And yet rather fruitless ,"" he admitted ; "" if I die tonight I die unmarried and a fool ."" "" It is not my fault if you have come ,"" she said after a difficult silence . "" It is never your fault ,"" answered Muscari ; "" it was not your fault that Troy fell ."" As they spoke they came under overwhelming cliffs that spread almost like wings above a corner of peculiar peril . Shocked by the big shadow on the narrow ledge , the horses stirred doubtfully ."
chesterton#The driver leapt to the earth to hold their heads , and they became ungovernable . One horse reared up to his full height -- the titanic and terrifying height of a horse when he becomes a biped . It was just enough to alter the equilibrium ; the whole coach heeled over like a ship and crashed through the fringe of bushes over the cliff . Muscari threw an arm round Ethel , who clung to him , and shouted aloud . It was for such moments that he lived . At the moment when the gorgeous mountain walls went round the poet ' s head like a purple windmill a thing happened which was superficially even more startling .
chesterton#The elderly and lethargic banker sprang erect in the coach and leapt over the precipice before the tilted vehicle could take him there . In the first flash it looked as wild as suicide ; but in the second it was as sensible as a safe investment . The Yorkshireman had evidently more promptitude , as well as more sagacity , than Muscari had given him credit for ; for he landed in a lap of land which might have been specially padded with turf and clover to receive him . As it happened , indeed , the whole company were equally lucky , if less dignified in their form of ejection . Immediately under this abrupt turn of the road was a grassy and flowery hollow like a sunken meadow ; a sort of green velvet pocket in the long , green , trailing garments of the hills . Into this they were all tipped or tumbled with little damage , save that their smallest baggage and even the contents of their pockets were scattered in the grass around them .
chesterton#"The wrecked coach still hung above , entangled in the tough hedge , and the horses plunged painfully down the slope . The first to sit up was the little priest , who scratched his head with a face of foolish wonder . Frank Harrogate heard him say to himself : "" Now why on earth have we fallen just here ?"" He blinked at the litter around him , and recovered his own very clumsy umbrella . Beyond it lay the broad sombrero fallen from the head of Muscari , and beside it a sealed business letter which , after a glance at the address , he returned to the elder Harrogate . On the other side of him the grass partly hid Miss Ethel ' s sunshade , and just beyond it lay a curious little glass bottle hardly two inches long ."
chesterton#"The priest picked it up ; in a quick , unobtrusive manner he uncorked and sniffed it , and his heavy face turned the colour of clay . "" Heaven deliver us !"" he muttered ; "" it can ' t be hers ! Has her sorrow come on her already ?"" He slipped it into his own waistcoat pocket . "" I think I ' m justified ,"" he said , "" till I know a little more ."""
chesterton#"He gazed painfully at the girl , at that moment being raised out of the flowers by Muscari , who was saying : "" We have fallen into heaven ; it is a sign . Mortals climb up and they fall down ; but it is only gods and goddesses who can fall upwards ."" And indeed she rose out of the sea of colours so beautiful and happy a vision that the priest felt his suspicion shaken and shifted . "" After all ,"" he thought , "" perhaps the poison isn ' t hers ; perhaps it ' s one of Muscari ' s melodramatic tricks ."" Muscari set the lady lightly on her feet , made her an absurdly theatrical bow , and then , drawing his cutlass , hacked hard at the taut reins of the horses , so that they scrambled to their feet and stood in the grass trembling . When he had done so , a most remarkable thing occurred ."
chesterton#"A very quiet man , very poorly dressed and extremely sunburnt , came out of the bushes and took hold of the horses ' heads . He had a queer - shaped knife , very broad and crooked , buckled on his belt ; there was nothing else remarkable about him , except his sudden and silent appearance . The poet asked him who he was , and he did not answer . Looking around him at the confused and startled group in the hollow , Muscari then perceived that another tanned and tattered man , with a short gun under his arm , was looking at them from the ledge just below , leaning his elbows on the edge of the turf . Then he looked up at the road from which they had fallen and saw , looking down on them , the muzzles of four other carbines and four other brown faces with bright but quite motionless eyes . "" The brigands !"""
chesterton#"cried Muscari , with a kind of monstrous gaiety . "" This was a trap . Ezza , if you will oblige me by shooting the coachman first , we can cut our way out yet . There are only six of them ."" "" The coachman ,"" said Ezza , who was standing grimly with his hands in his pockets , "" happens to be a servant of Mr Harrogate ' s ."" "" Then shoot him all the more ,"" cried the poet impatiently ; "" he was bribed to upset his master ."
chesterton#"Then put the lady in the middle , and we will break the line up there -- with a rush ."" And , wading in wild grass and flowers , he advanced fearlessly on the four carbines ; but finding that no one followed except young Harrogate , he turned , brandishing his cutlass to wave the others on . He beheld the courier still standing slightly astride in the centre of the grassy ring , his hands in his pockets ; and his lean , ironical Italian face seemed to grow longer and longer in the evening light . "" You thought , Muscari , I was the failure among our schoolfellows ,"" he said , "" and you thought you were the success . But I have succeeded more than you and fill a bigger place in history . I have been acting epics while you have been writing them ."""
chesterton#""" Come on , I tell you !"" thundered Muscari from above . "" Will you stand there talking nonsense about yourself with a woman to save and three strong men to help you ? What do you call yourself ?"" "" I call myself Montano ,"" cried the strange courier in a voice equally loud and full . "" I am the King of Thieves , and I welcome you all to my summer palace ."""
chesterton#"And even as he spoke five more silent men with weapons ready came out of the bushes , and looked towards him for their orders . One of them held a large paper in his hand . "" This pretty little nest where we are all picnicking ,"" went on the courier - brigand , with the same easy yet sinister smile , "" is , together with some caves underneath it , known by the name of the Paradise of Thieves . It is my principal stronghold on these hills ; for ( as you have doubtless noticed ) the eyrie is invisible both from the road above and from the valley below . It is something better than impregnable ; it is unnoticeable . Here I mostly live , and here I shall certainly die , if the gendarmes ever track me here ."
chesterton#"I am not the kind of criminal that ` reserves his defence ,' but the better kind that reserves his last bullet ."" All were staring at him thunderstruck and still , except Father Brown , who heaved a huge sigh as of relief and fingered the little phial in his pocket . "" Thank God !"" he muttered ; "" that ' s much more probable . The poison belongs to this robber - chief , of course . He carries it so that he may never be captured , like Cato ."""
chesterton#"The King of Thieves was , however , continuing his address with the same kind of dangerous politeness . "" It only remains for me ,"" he said , "" to explain to my guests the social conditions upon which I have the pleasure of entertaining them . I need not expound the quaint old ritual of ransom , which it is incumbent upon me to keep up ; and even this only applies to a part of the company . The Reverend Father Brown and the celebrated Signor Muscari I shall release tomorrow at dawn and escort to my outposts . Poets and priests , if you will pardon my simplicity of speech , never have any money . And so ( since it is impossible to get anything out of them ), let us , seize the opportunity to show our admiration for classic literature and our reverence for Holy Church ."""
chesterton#"He paused with an unpleasing smile ; and Father Brown blinked repeatedly at him , and seemed suddenly to be listening with great attention . The brigand captain took the large paper from the attendant brigand and , glancing over it , continued : "" My other intentions are clearly set forth in this public document , which I will hand round in a moment ; and which after that will be posted on a tree by every village in the valley , and every cross - road in the hills . I will not weary you with the verbalism , since you will be able to check it ; the substance of my proclamation is this : I announce first that I have captured the English millionaire , the colossus of finance , Mr Samuel Harrogate . I next announce that I have found on his person notes and bonds for two thousand pounds , which he has given up to me . Now since it would be really immoral to announce such a thing to a credulous public if it had not occurred , I suggest it should occur without further delay . I suggest that Mr Harrogate senior should now give me the two thousand pounds in his pocket ."""
chesterton#"The banker looked at him under lowering brows , red - faced and sulky , but seemingly cowed . That leap from the failing carriage seemed to have used up his last virility . He had held back in a hang - dog style when his son and Muscari had made a bold movement to break out of the brigand trap . And now his red and trembling hand went reluctantly to his breast - pocket , and passed a bundle of papers and envelopes to the brigand . "" Excellent !"" cried that outlaw gaily ; "" so far we are all cosy ."
chesterton#"I resume the points of my proclamation , so soon to be published to all Italy . The third item is that of ransom . I am asking from the friends of the Harrogate family a ransom of three thousand pounds , which I am sure is almost insulting to that family in its moderate estimate of their importance . Who would not pay triple this sum for another day ' s association with such a domestic circle ? I will not conceal from you that the document ends with certain legal phrases about the unpleasant things that may happen if the money is not paid ; but meanwhile , ladies and gentlemen , let me assure you that I am comfortably off here for accommodation , wine and cigars , and bid you for the present a sportsman - like welcome to the luxuries of the Paradise of Thieves ."" All the time that he had been speaking , the dubious - looking men with carbines and dirty slouch hats had been gathering silently in such preponderating numbers that even Muscari was compelled to recognize his sally with the sword as hopeless ."
chesterton#"He glanced around him ; but the girl had already gone over to soothe and comfort her father , for her natural affection for his person was as strong or stronger than her somewhat snobbish pride in his success . Muscari , with the illogicality of a lover , admired this filial devotion , and yet was irritated by it . He slapped his sword back in the scabbard and went and flung himself somewhat sulkily on one of the green banks . The priest sat down within a yard or two , and Muscari turned his aquiline nose on him in an instantaneous irritation . "" Well ,"" said the poet tartly , "" do people still think me too romantic ? Are there , I wonder , any brigands left in the mountains ?"""
chesterton#""" There may be ,"" said Father Brown agnostically . "" What do you mean ?"" asked the other sharply . "" I mean I am puzzled ,"" replied the priest . "" I am puzzled about Ezza or Montano , or whatever his name is . He seems to me much more inexplicable as a brigand even than he was as a courier ."""
chesterton#""" But in what way ?"" persisted his companion . "" Santa Maria ! I should have thought the brigand was plain enough ."" "" I find three curious difficulties ,"" said the priest in a quiet voice . "" I should like to have your opinion on them ."
chesterton#First of all I must tell you I was lunching in that restaurant at the seaside . As four of you left the room , you and Miss Harrogate went ahead , talking and laughing ; the banker and the courier came behind , speaking sparely and rather low . But I could not help hearing Ezza say these words --` Well , let her have a little fun ; you know the blow may smash her any minute .' Mr Harrogate answered nothing ; so the words must have had some meaning . On the impulse of the moment I warned her brother that she might be in peril ; I said nothing of its nature , for I did not know . But if it meant this capture in the hills , the thing is nonsense .
chesterton#"Why should the brigand - courier warn his patron , even by a hint , when it was his whole purpose to lure him into the mountain - mousetrap ? It could not have meant that . But if not , what is this disaster , known both to courier and banker , which hangs over Miss Harrogate ' s head ?"" "" Disaster to Miss Harrogate !"" ejaculated the poet , sitting up with some ferocity . "" Explain yourself ; go on ."""
chesterton#""" All my riddles , however , revolve round our bandit chief ,"" resumed the priest reflectively . "" And here is the second of them . Why did he put so prominently in his demand for ransom the fact that he had taken two thousand pounds from his victim on the spot ? It had no faintest tendency to evoke the ransom . Quite the other way , in fact . Harrogate ' s friends would be far likelier to fear for his fate if they thought the thieves were poor and desperate ."
chesterton#"Yet the spoliation on the spot was emphasized and even put first in the demand . Why should Ezza Montano want so specially to tell all Europe that he had picked the pocket before he levied the blackmail ?"" "" I cannot imagine ,"" said Muscari , rubbing up his black hair for once with an unaffected gesture . "" You may think you enlighten me , but you are leading me deeper in the dark . What may be the third objection to the King of the Thieves ?"" "" The third objection ,"" said Father Brown , still in meditation , "" is this bank we are sitting on ."
chesterton#Why does our brigand - courier call this his chief fortress and the Paradise of Thieves ? It is certainly a soft spot to fall on and a sweet spot to look at . It is also quite true , as he says , that it is invisible from valley and peak , and is therefore a hiding - place . But it is not a fortress . It never could be a fortress . I think it would be the worst fortress in the world .
chesterton#"For it is actually commanded from above by the common high - road across the mountains -- the very place where the police would most probably pass . Why , five shabby short guns held us helpless here about half an hour ago . The quarter of a company of any kind of soldiers could have blown us over the precipice . Whatever is the meaning of this odd little nook of grass and flowers , it is not an entrenched position . It is something else ; it has some other strange sort of importance ; some value that I do not understand . It is more like an accidental theatre or a natural green - room ; it is like the scene for some romantic comedy ; it is like ...."""
chesterton#As the little priest ' s words lengthened and lost themselves in a dull and dreamy sincerity , Muscari , whose animal senses were alert and impatient , heard a new noise in the mountains . Even for him the sound was as yet very small and faint ; but he could have sworn the evening breeze bore with it something like the pulsation of horses ' hoofs and a distant hallooing . At the same moment , and long before the vibration had touched the less - experienced English ears , Montano the brigand ran up the bank above them and stood in the broken hedge , steadying himself against a tree and peering down the road . He was a strange figure as he stood there , for he had assumed a flapped fantastic hat and swinging baldric and cutlass in his capacity of bandit king , but the bright prosaic tweed of the courier showed through in patches all over him . The next moment he turned his olive , sneering face and made a movement with his hand . The brigands scattered at the signal , not in confusion , but in what was evidently a kind of guerrilla discipline .
chesterton#"Instead of occupying the road along the ridge , they sprinkled themselves along the side of it behind the trees and the hedge , as if watching unseen for an enemy . The noise beyond grew stronger , beginning to shake the mountain road , and a voice could be clearly heard calling out orders . The brigands swayed and huddled , cursing and whispering , and the evening air was full of little metallic noises as they cocked their pistols , or loosened their knives , or trailed their scabbards over the stones . Then the noises from both quarters seemed to meet on the road above ; branches broke , horses neighed , men cried out . "" A rescue !"" cried Muscari , springing to his feet and waving his hat ; "" the gendarmes are on them !"
chesterton#"Now for freedom and a blow for it ! Now to be rebels against robbers ! Come , don ' t let us leave everything to the police ; that is so dreadfully modern . Fall on the rear of these ruffians . The gendarmes are rescuing us ; come , friends , let us rescue the gendarmes !"" And throwing his hat over the trees , he drew his cutlass once more and began to escalade the slope up to the road ."
chesterton#"Frank Harrogate jumped up and ran across to help him , revolver in hand , but was astounded to hear himself imperatively recalled by the raucous voice of his father , who seemed to be in great agitation . "" I won ' t have it ,"" said the banker in a choking voice ; "" I command you not to interfere ."" "" But , father ,"" said Frank very warmly , "" an Italian gentleman has led the way . You wouldn ' t have it said that the English hung back ."" "" It is useless ,"" said the older man , who was trembling violently , "" it is useless . We must submit to our lot ."""
chesterton#"Father Brown looked at the banker ; then he put his hand instinctively as if on his heart , but really on the little bottle of poison ; and a great light came into his face like the light of the revelation of death . Muscari meanwhile , without waiting for support , had crested the bank up to the road , and struck the brigand king heavily on the shoulder , causing him to stagger and swing round . Montano also had his cutlass unsheathed , and Muscari , without further speech , sent a slash at his head which he was compelled to catch and parry . But even as the two short blades crossed and clashed the King of Thieves deliberately dropped his point and laughed . "" What ' s the good , old man ?"" he said in spirited Italian slang ; "" this damned farce will soon be over ."""
chesterton#""" What do you mean , you shuffler ?"" panted the fire - eating poet . "" Is your courage a sham as well as your honesty ?"" "" Everything about me is a sham ,"" responded the ex - courier in complete good humour . "" I am an actor ; and if I ever had a private character , I have forgotten it . I am no more a genuine brigand than I am a genuine courier ."
chesterton#"I am only a bundle of masks , and you can ' t fight a duel with that ."" And he laughed with boyish pleasure and fell into his old straddling attitude , with his back to the skirmish up the road . Darkness was deepening under the mountain walls , and it was not easy to discern much of the progress of the struggle , save that tall men were pushing their horses ' muzzles through a clinging crowd of brigands , who seemed more inclined to harass and hustle the invaders than to kill them . It was more like a town crowd preventing the passage of the police than anything the poet had ever pictured as the last stand of doomed and outlawed men of blood . Just as he was rolling his eyes in bewilderment he felt a touch on his elbow , and found the odd little priest standing there like a small Noah with a large hat , and requesting the favour of a word or two . "" Signor Muscari ,"" said the cleric , "" in this queer crisis personalities may be pardoned ."
chesterton#"I may tell you without offence of a way in which you will do more good than by helping the gendarmes , who are bound to break through in any case . You will permit me the impertinent intimacy , but do you care about that girl ? Care enough to marry her and make her a good husband , I mean ?"" "" Yes ,"" said the poet quite simply . "" Does she care about you ?"" "" I think so ,"" was the equally grave reply ."
chesterton#""" Then go over there and offer yourself ,"" said the priest : "" offer her everything you can ; offer her heaven and earth if you ' ve got them . The time is short ."" "" Why ?"" asked the astonished man of letters . "" Because ,"" said Father Brown , "" her Doom is coming up the road ."" "" Nothing is coming up the road ,"" argued Muscari , "" except the rescue ."""
chesterton#""" Well , you go over there ,"" said his adviser , "" and be ready to rescue her from the rescue ."" Almost as he spoke the hedges were broken all along the ridge by a rush of the escaping brigands . They dived into bushes and thick grass like defeated men pursued ; and the great cocked hats of the mounted gendarmerie were seen passing along above the broken hedge . Another order was given ; there was a noise of dismounting , and a tall officer with cocked hat , a grey imperial , and a paper in his hand appeared in the gap that was the gate of the Paradise of Thieves . There was a momentary silence , broken in an extraordinary way by the banker , who cried out in a hoarse and strangled voice : "" Robbed ! I ' ve been robbed !"""
chesterton#""" Why , that was hours ago ,"" cried his son in astonishment : "" when you were robbed of two thousand pounds ."" "" Not of two thousand pounds ,"" said the financier , with an abrupt and terrible composure , "" only of a small bottle ."" The policeman with the grey imperial was striding across the green hollow . Encountering the King of the Thieves in his path , he clapped him on the shoulder with something between a caress and a buffet and gave him a push that sent him staggering away . "" You ' ll get into trouble , too ,"" he said , "" if you play these tricks ."" Again to Muscari ' s artistic eye it seemed scarcely like the capture of a great outlaw at bay ."
chesterton#"Passing on , the policeman halted before the Harrogate group and said : "" Samuel Harrogate , I arrest you in the name of the law for embezzlement of the funds of the Hull and Huddersfield Bank ."" The great banker nodded with an odd air of business assent , seemed to reflect a moment , and before they could interpose took a half turn and a step that brought him to the edge of the outer mountain wall . Then , flinging up his hands , he leapt exactly as he leapt out of the coach . But this time he did not fall into a little meadow just beneath ; he fell a thousand feet below , to become a wreck of bones in the valley . The anger of the Italian policeman , which he expressed volubly to Father Brown , was largely mixed with admiration . "" It was like him to escape us at last ,"" he said ."
chesterton#""" He was a great brigand if you like . This last trick of his I believe to be absolutely unprecedented . He fled with the company ' s money to Italy , and actually got himself captured by sham brigands in his own pay , so as to explain both the disappearance of the money and the disappearance of himself . That demand for ransom was really taken seriously by most of the police . But for years he ' s been doing things as good as that , quite as good as that . He will be a serious loss to his family ."""
chesterton#"Muscari was leading away the unhappy daughter , who held hard to him , as she did for many a year after . But even in that tragic wreck he could not help having a smile and a hand of half - mocking friendship for the indefensible Ezza Montano . "" And where are you going next ?"" he asked him over his shoulder . "" Birmingham ,"" answered the actor , puffing a cigarette . "" Didn ' t I tell you I was a Futurist ?"
chesterton#"I really do believe in those things if I believe in anything . Change , bustle and new things every morning . I am going to Manchester , Liverpool , Leeds , Hull , Huddersfield , Glasgow , Chicago -- in short , to enlightened , energetic , civilized society !"" "" In short ,"" said Muscari , "" to the real Paradise of Thieves ."" III . The Duel of Dr Hirsch"
chesterton#M . MAURICE BRUN and M . Armand Armagnac were crossing the sunlit Champs Elysee with a kind of vivacious respectability . They were both short , brisk and bold . They both had black beards that did not seem to belong to their faces , after the strange French fashion which makes real hair look like artificial . M . Brun had a dark wedge of beard apparently affixed under his lower lip . M . Armagnac , by way of a change , had two beards ; one sticking out from each corner of his emphatic chin . They were both young .
chesterton#"They were both atheists , with a depressing fixity of outlook but great mobility of exposition . They were both pupils of the great Dr Hirsch , scientist , publicist and moralist . M . Brun had become prominent by his proposal that the common expression "" Adieu "" should be obliterated from all the French classics , and a slight fine imposed for its use in private life . "" Then ,"" he said , "" the very name of your imagined God will have echoed for the last time in the ear of man ."" M . Armagnac specialized rather in a resistance to militarism , and wished the chorus of the Marseillaise altered from "" Aux armes , citoyens "" to "" Aux greves , citoyens "". But his antimilitarism was of a peculiar and Gallic sort ."
chesterton#An eminent and very wealthy English Quaker , who had come to see him to arrange for the disarmament of the whole planet , was rather distressed by Armagnac ' s proposal that ( by way of beginning ) the soldiers should shoot their officers . And indeed it was in this regard that the two men differed most from their leader and father in philosophy . Dr Hirsch , though born in France and covered with the most triumphant favours of French education , was temperamentally of another type -- mild , dreamy , humane ; and , despite his sceptical system , not devoid of transcendentalism . He was , in short , more like a German than a Frenchman ; and much as they admired him , something in the subconsciousness of these Gauls was irritated at his pleading for peace in so peaceful a manner . To their party throughout Europe , however , Paul Hirsch was a saint of science . His large and daring cosmic theories advertised his austere life and innocent , if somewhat frigid , morality ; he held something of the position of Darwin doubled with the position of Tolstoy .
chesterton#But he was neither an anarchist nor an antipatriot ; his views on disarmament were moderate and evolutionary -- the Republican Government put considerable confidence in him as to various chemical improvements . He had lately even discovered a noiseless explosive , the secret of which the Government was carefully guarding . His house stood in a handsome street near the Elysee -- a street which in that strong summer seemed almost as full of foliage as the park itself ; a row of chestnuts shattered the sunshine , interrupted only in one place where a large cafe ran out into the street . Almost opposite to this were the white and green blinds of the great scientist ' s house , an iron balcony , also painted green , running along in front of the first - floor windows . Beneath this was the entrance into a kind of court , gay with shrubs and tiles , into which the two Frenchmen passed in animated talk . The door was opened to them by the doctor ' s old servant , Simon , who might very well have passed for a doctor himself , having a strict suit of black , spectacles , grey hair , and a confidential manner .
chesterton#In fact , he was a far more presentable man of science than his master , Dr Hirsch , who was a forked radish of a fellow , with just enough bulb of a head to make his body insignificant . With all the gravity of a great physician handling a prescription , Simon handed a letter to M . Armagnac . That gentleman ripped it up with a racial impatience , and rapidly read the following : I cannot come down to speak to you . There is a man in this house whom I refuse to meet . He is a Chauvinist officer , Dubosc .
chesterton#He is sitting on the stairs . He has been kicking the furniture about in all the other rooms ; I have locked myself in my study , opposite that cafe . If you love me , go over to the cafe and wait at one of the tables outside . I will try to send him over to you . I want you to answer him and deal with him . I cannot meet him myself .
chesterton#I cannot : I will not . There is going to be another Dreyfus case . P . HIRSCH M . Armagnac looked at M . Brun . M . Brun borrowed the letter , read it , and looked at M . Armagnac . Then both betook themselves briskly to one of the little tables under the chestnuts opposite , where they procured two tall glasses of horrible green absinthe , which they could drink apparently in any weather and at any time .
chesterton#"Otherwise the cafe seemed empty , except for one soldier drinking coffee at one table , and at another a large man drinking a small syrup and a priest drinking nothing . Maurice Brun cleared his throat and said : "" Of course we must help the master in every way , but --"" There was an abrupt silence , and Armagnac said : "" He may have excellent reasons for not meeting the man himself , but --"" Before either could complete a sentence , it was evident that the invader had been expelled from the house opposite . The shrubs under the archway swayed and burst apart , as that unwelcome guest was shot out of them like a cannon - ball . He was a sturdy figure in a small and tilted Tyrolean felt hat , a figure that had indeed something generally Tyrolean about it ."
chesterton#The man ' s shoulders were big and broad , but his legs were neat and active in knee - breeches and knitted stockings . His face was brown like a nut ; he had very bright and restless brown eyes ; his dark hair was brushed back stiffly in front and cropped close behind , outlining a square and powerful skull ; and he had a huge black moustache like the horns of a bison . Such a substantial head is generally based on a bull neck ; but this was hidden by a big coloured scarf , swathed round up the man ' s ears and falling in front inside his jacket like a sort of fancy waistcoat . It was a scarf of strong dead colours , dark red and old gold and purple , probably of Oriental fabrication . Altogether the man had something a shade barbaric about him ; more like a Hungarian squire than an ordinary French officer . His French , however , was obviously that of a native ; and his French patriotism was so impulsive as to be slightly absurd .
chesterton#"His first act when he burst out of the archway was to call in a clarion voice down the street : "" Are there any Frenchmen here ?"" as if he were calling for Christians in Mecca . Armagnac and Brun instantly stood up ; but they were too late . Men were already running from the street corners ; there was a small but ever - clustering crowd . With the prompt French instinct for the politics of the street , the man with the black moustache had already run across to a corner of the cafe , sprung on one of the tables , and seizing a branch of chestnut to steady himself , shouted as Camille Desmoulins once shouted when he scattered the oak - leaves among the populace . "" Frenchmen !"""
chesterton#"he volleyed ; "" I cannot speak ! God help me , that is why I am speaking ! The fellows in their filthy parliaments who learn to speak also learn to be silent -- silent as that spy cowering in the house opposite ! Silent as he is when I beat on his bedroom door ! Silent as he is now , though he hears my voice across this street and shakes where he sits ! Oh , they can be silent eloquently -- the politicians !"
chesterton#But the time has come when we that cannot speak must speak . You are betrayed to the Prussians . Betrayed at this moment . Betrayed by that man . I am Jules Dubosc , Colonel of Artillery , Belfort . We caught a German spy in the Vosges yesterday , and a paper was found on him -- a paper I hold in my hand .
chesterton#Oh , they tried to hush it up ; but I took it direct to the man who wrote it -- the man in that house ! It is in his hand . It is signed with his initials . It is a direction for finding the secret of this new Noiseless Powder . Hirsch invented it ; Hirsch wrote this note about it . This note is in German , and was found in a German ' s pocket .
chesterton#"` Tell the man the formula for powder is in grey envelope in first drawer to the left of Secretary ' s desk , War Office , in red ink . He must be careful . P . H .'"" He rattled short sentences like a quick - firing gun , but he was plainly the sort of man who is either mad or right . The mass of the crowd was Nationalist , and already in threatening uproar ; and a minority of equally angry Intellectuals , led by Armagnac and Brun , only made the majority more militant . "" If this is a military secret ,"" shouted Brun , "" why do you yell about it in the street ?"""
chesterton#""" I will tell you why I do !"" roared Dubosc above the roaring crowd . "" I went to this man in straight and civil style . If he had any explanation it could have been given in complete confidence . He refuses to explain . He refers me to two strangers in a cafe as to two flunkeys ."
chesterton#"He has thrown me out of the house , but I am going back into it , with the people of Paris behind me !"" A shout seemed to shake the very facade of mansions and two stones flew , one breaking a window above the balcony . The indignant Colonel plunged once more under the archway and was heard crying and thundering inside . Every instant the human sea grew wider and wider ; it surged up against the rails and steps of the traitor ' s house ; it was already certain that the place would be burst into like the Bastille , when the broken french window opened and Dr Hirsch came out on the balcony . For an instant the fury half turned to laughter ; for he was an absurd figure in such a scene . His long bare neck and sloping shoulders were the shape of a champagne bottle , but that was the only festive thing about him ."
chesterton#"His coat hung on him as on a peg ; he wore his carrot - coloured hair long and weedy ; his cheeks and chin were fully fringed with one of those irritating beards that begin far from the mouth . He was very pale , and he wore blue spectacles . Livid as he was , he spoke with a sort of prim decision , so that the mob fell silent in the middle of his third sentence . ""... only two things to say to you now . The first is to my foes , the second to my friends . To my foes I say : It is true I will not meet M . Dubosc , though he is storming outside this very room ."
chesterton#"It is true I have asked two other men to confront him for me . And I will tell you why ! Because I will not and must not see him -- because it would be against all rules of dignity and honour to see him . Before I am triumphantly cleared before a court , there is another arbitration this gentleman owes me as a gentleman , and in referring him to my seconds I am strictly --"" Armagnac and Brun were waving their hats wildly , and even the Doctor ' s enemies roared applause at this unexpected defiance . Once more a few sentences were inaudible , but they could hear him say : "" To my friends -- I myself should always prefer weapons purely intellectual , and to these an evolved humanity will certainly confine itself ."
chesterton#"But our own most precious truth is the fundamental force of matter and heredity . My books are successful ; my theories are unrefuted ; but I suffer in politics from a prejudice almost physical in the French . I cannot speak like Clemenceau and Deroulede , for their words are like echoes of their pistols . The French ask for a duellist as the English ask for a sportsman . Well , I give my proofs : I will pay this barbaric bribe , and then go back to reason for the rest of my life ."" Two men were instantly found in the crowd itself to offer their services to Colonel Dubosc , who came out presently , satisfied ."
chesterton#"One was the common soldier with the coffee , who said simply : "" I will act for you , sir . I am the Duc de Valognes ."" The other was the big man , whom his friend the priest sought at first to dissuade ; and then walked away alone . In the early evening a light dinner was spread at the back of the Cafe Charlemagne . Though unroofed by any glass or gilt plaster , the guests were nearly all under a delicate and irregular roof of leaves ; for the ornamental trees stood so thick around and among the tables as to give something of the dimness and the dazzle of a small orchard . At one of the central tables a very stumpy little priest sat in complete solitude , and applied himself to a pile of whitebait with the gravest sort of enjoyment ."
chesterton#"His daily living being very plain , he had a peculiar taste for sudden and isolated luxuries ; he was an abstemious epicure . He did not lift his eyes from his plate , round which red pepper , lemons , brown bread and butter , etc ., were rigidly ranked , until a tall shadow fell across the table , and his friend Flambeau sat down opposite . Flambeau was gloomy . "" I ' m afraid I must chuck this business ,"" said he heavily . "" I ' m all on the side of the French soldiers like Dubosc , and I ' m all against the French atheists like Hirsch ; but it seems to me in this case we ' ve made a mistake . The Duke and I thought it as well to investigate the charge , and I must say I ' m glad we did ."""
chesterton#""" Is the paper a forgery , then ?"" asked the priest "" That ' s just the odd thing ,"" replied Flambeau . "" It ' s exactly like Hirsch ' s writing , and nobody can point out any mistake in it . But it wasn ' t written by Hirsch . If he ' s a French patriot he didn ' t write it , because it gives information to Germany ."
chesterton#"And if he ' s a German spy he didn ' t write it , well -- because it doesn ' t give information to Germany ."" "" You mean the information is wrong ?"" asked Father Brown . "" Wrong ,"" replied the other , "" and wrong exactly where Dr Hirsch would have been right -- about the hiding - place of his own secret formula in his own official department . By favour of Hirsch and the authorities , the Duke and I have actually been allowed to inspect the secret drawer at the War Office where the Hirsch formula is kept . We are the only people who have ever known it , except the inventor himself and the Minister for War ; but the Minister permitted it to save Hirsch from fighting ."
chesterton#"After that we really can ' t support Dubosc if his revelation is a mare ' s nest ."" "" And it is ?"" asked Father Brown . "" It is ,"" said his friend gloomily . "" It is a clumsy forgery by somebody who knew nothing of the real hiding - place . It says the paper is in the cupboard on the right of the Secretary ' s desk ."
chesterton#"As a fact the cupboard with the secret drawer is some way to the left of the desk . It says the grey envelope contains a long document written in red ink . It isn ' t written in red ink , but in ordinary black ink . It ' s manifestly absurd to say that Hirsch can have made a mistake about a paper that nobody knew of but himself ; or can have tried to help a foreign thief by telling him to fumble in the wrong drawer . I think we must chuck it up and apologize to old Carrots ."" Father Brown seemed to cogitate ; he lifted a little whitebait on his fork ."
chesterton#""" You are sure the grey envelope was in the left cupboard ?"" he asked . "" Positive ,"" replied Flambeau . "" The grey envelope -- it was a white envelope really -- was --"" Father Brown put down the small silver fish and the fork and stared across at his companion . "" What ?"""
chesterton#"he asked , in an altered voice . "" Well , what ?"" repeated Flambeau , eating heartily . "" It was not grey ,"" said the priest . "" Flambeau , you frighten me ."" "" What the deuce are you frightened of ?"""
chesterton#""" I ' m frightened of a white envelope ,"" said the other seriously , "" If it had only just been grey ! Hang it all , it might as well have been grey . But if it was white , the whole business is black . The Doctor has been dabbling in some of the old brimstone after all ."" "" But I tell you he couldn ' t have written such a note !"" cried Flambeau ."
chesterton#""" The note is utterly wrong about the facts . And innocent or guilty , Dr Hirsch knew all about the facts ."" "" The man who wrote that note knew all about the facts ,"" said his clerical companion soberly . "" He could never have got ' em so wrong without knowing about ' em . You have to know an awful lot to be wrong on every subject -- like the devil ."" "" Do you mean --?"""
chesterton#""" I mean a man telling lies on chance would have told some of the truth ,"" said his friend firmly . "" Suppose someone sent you to find a house with a green door and a blue blind , with a front garden but no back garden , with a dog but no cat , and where they drank coffee but not tea . You would say if you found no such house that it was all made up . But I say no . I say if you found a house where the door was blue and the blind green , where there was a back garden and no front garden , where cats were common and dogs instantly shot , where tea was drunk in quarts and coffee forbidden -- then you would know you had found the house . The man must have known that particular house to be so accurately inaccurate ."""
chesterton#""" But what could it mean ?"" demanded the diner opposite . "" I can ' t conceive ,"" said Brown ; "" I don ' t understand this Hirsch affair at all . As long as it was only the left drawer instead of the right , and red ink instead of black , I thought it must be the chance blunders of a forger , as you say . But three is a mystical number ; it finishes things . It finishes this ."
chesterton#"That the direction about the drawer , the colour of ink , the colour of envelope , should none of them be right by accident , that can ' t be a coincidence . It wasn ' t ."" "" What was it , then ? Treason ?"" asked Flambeau , resuming his dinner . "" I don ' t know that either ,"" answered Brown , with a face of blank bewilderment ."
chesterton#""" The only thing I can think of .... Well , I never understood that Dreyfus case . I can always grasp moral evidence easier than the other sorts . I go by a man ' s eyes and voice , don ' t you know , and whether his family seems happy , and by what subjects he chooses -- and avoids . Well , I was puzzled in the Dreyfus case . Not by the horrible things imputed both ways ; I know ( though it ' s not modern to say so ) that human nature in the highest places is still capable of being Cenci or Borgia . No --, what puzzled me was the sincerity of both parties ."
chesterton#I don ' t mean the political parties ; the rank and file are always roughly honest , and often duped . I mean the persons of the play . I mean the conspirators , if they were conspirators . I mean the traitor , if he was a traitor . I mean the men who must have known the truth . Now Dreyfus went on like a man who knew he was a wronged man .
chesterton#"And yet the French statesmen and soldiers went on as if they knew he wasn ' t a wronged man but simply a wrong ' un . I don ' t mean they behaved well ; I mean they behaved as if they were sure . I can ' t describe these things ; I know what I mean ."" "" I wish I did ,"" said his friend . "" And what has it to do with old Hirsch ?"" "" Suppose a person in a position of trust ,"" went on the priest , "" began to give the enemy information because it was false information ."
chesterton#"Suppose he even thought he was saving his country by misleading the foreigner . Suppose this brought him into spy circles , and little loans were made to him , and little ties tied on to him . Suppose he kept up his contradictory position in a confused way by never telling the foreign spies the truth , but letting it more and more be guessed . The better part of him ( what was left of it ) would still say : ` I have not helped the enemy ; I said it was the left drawer .' The meaner part of him would already be saying : ` But they may have the sense to see that means the right .' I think it is psychologically possible -- in an enlightened age , you know ."""
chesterton#""" It may be psychologically possible ,"" answered Flambeau , "" and it certainly would explain Dreyfus being certain he was wronged and his judges being sure he was guilty . But it won ' t wash historically , because Dreyfus ' s document ( if it was his document ) was literally correct ."" "" I wasn ' t thinking of Dreyfus ,"" said Father Brown . Silence had sunk around them with the emptying of the tables ; it was already late , though the sunlight still clung to everything , as if accidentally entangled in the trees . In the stillness Flambeau shifted his seat sharply -- making an isolated and echoing noise -- and threw his elbow over the angle of it . "" Well ,"" he said , rather harshly , "" if Hirsch is not better than a timid treason - monger ..."""
chesterton#""" You mustn ' t be too hard on them ,"" said Father Brown gently . "" It ' s not entirely their fault ; but they have no instincts . I mean those things that make a woman refuse to dance with a man or a man to touch an investment . They ' ve been taught that it ' s all a matter of degree ."" "" Anyhow ,"" cried Flambeau impatiently , "" he ' s not a patch on my principal ; and I shall go through with it . Old Dubosc may be a bit mad , but he ' s a sort of patriot after all ."""
chesterton#"Father Brown continued to consume whitebait . Something in the stolid way he did so caused Flambeau ' s fierce black eyes to ramble over his companion afresh . "" What ' s the matter with you ?"" Flambeau demanded . "" Dubosc ' s all right in that way . You don ' t doubt him ?"""
chesterton#""" My friend ,"" said the small priest , laying down his knife and fork in a kind of cold despair , "" I doubt everything . Everything , I mean , that has happened today . I doubt the whole story , though it has been acted before my face . I doubt every sight that my eyes have seen since morning . There is something in this business quite different from the ordinary police mystery where one man is more or less lying and the other man more or less telling the truth . Here both men .... Well !"
chesterton#"I ' ve told you the only theory I can think of that could satisfy anybody . It doesn ' t satisfy me ."" "" Nor me either ,"" replied Flambeau frowning , while the other went on eating fish with an air of entire resignation . "" If all you can suggest is that notion of a message conveyed by contraries , I call it uncommonly clever , but ... well , what would you call it ?"" "" I should call it thin ,"" said the priest promptly . "" I should call it uncommonly thin ."
chesterton#But that ' s the queer thing about the whole business . The lie is like a schoolboy ' s . There are only three versions , Dubosc ' s and Hirsch ' s and that fancy of mine . Either that note was written by a French officer to ruin a French official ; or it was written by the French official to help German officers ; or it was written by the French official to mislead German officers . Very well . You ' d expect a secret paper passing between such people , officials or officers , to look quite different from that .
chesterton#"You ' d expect , probably a cipher , certainly abbreviations ; most certainly scientific and strictly professional terms . But this thing ' s elaborately simple , like a penny dreadful : ` In the purple grotto you will find the golden casket .' It looks as if ... as if it were meant to be seen through at once ."" Almost before they could take it in a short figure in French uniform had walked up to their table like the wind , and sat down with a sort of thump . "" I have extraordinary news ,"" said the Duc de Valognes . "" I have just come from this Colonel of ours ."
chesterton#"He is packing up to leave the country , and he asks us to make his excuses sur le terrain ."" "" What ?"" cried Flambeau , with an incredulity quite frightful -- "" apologize ?"" "" Yes ,"" said the Duke gruffly ; "" then and there -- before everybody -- when the swords are drawn . And you and I have to do it while he is leaving the country ."" "" But what can this mean ?"""
chesterton#"cried Flambeau . "" He can ' t be afraid of that little Hirsch ! Confound it !"" he cried , in a kind of rational rage ; "" nobody could be afraid of Hirsch !"" "" I believe it ' s some plot !"" snapped Valognes --"" some plot of the Jews and Freemasons ."
chesterton#"It ' s meant to work up glory for Hirsch ..."" The face of Father Brown was commonplace , but curiously contented ; it could shine with ignorance as well as with knowledge . But there was always one flash when the foolish mask fell , and the wise mask fitted itself in its place ; and Flambeau , who knew his friend , knew that his friend had suddenly understood . Brown said nothing , but finished his plate of fish . "" Where did you last see our precious Colonel ?"" asked Flambeau , irritably ."
chesterton#""" He ' s round at the Hotel Saint Louis by the Elysee , where we drove with him . He ' s packing up , I tell you ."" "" Will he be there still , do you think ?"" asked Flambeau , frowning at the table . "" I don ' t think he can get away yet ,"" replied the Duke ; "" he ' s packing to go a long journey ..."" "" No ,"" said Father Brown , quite simply , but suddenly standing up , "" for a very short journey ."
chesterton#"For one of the shortest , in fact . But we may still be in time to catch him if we go there in a motor - cab ."" Nothing more could be got out of him until the cab swept round the corner by the Hotel Saint Louis , where they got out , and he led the party up a side lane already in deep shadow with the growing dusk . Once , when the Duke impatiently asked whether Hirsch was guilty of treason or not , he answered rather absently : "" No ; only of ambition -- like Caesar ."" Then he somewhat inconsequently added : "" He lives a very lonely life ; he has had to do everything for himself ."" "" Well , if he ' s ambitious , he ought to be satisfied now ,"" said Flambeau rather bitterly ."
chesterton#""" All Paris will cheer him now our cursed Colonel has turned tail ."" "" Don ' t talk so loud ,"" said Father Brown , lowering his voice , "" your cursed Colonel is just in front ."" The other two started and shrank farther back into the shadow of the wall , for the sturdy figure of their runaway principal could indeed be seen shuffling along in the twilight in front , a bag in each hand . He looked much the same as when they first saw him , except that he had changed his picturesque mountaineering knickers for a conventional pair of trousers . It was clear he was already escaping from the hotel . The lane down which they followed him was one of those that seem to be at the back of things , and look like the wrong side of the stage scenery ."
chesterton#"A colourless , continuous wall ran down one flank of it , interrupted at intervals by dull - hued and dirt - stained doors , all shut fast and featureless save for the chalk scribbles of some passing gamin . The tops of trees , mostly rather depressing evergreens , showed at intervals over the top of the wall , and beyond them in the grey and purple gloaming could be seen the back of some long terrace of tall Parisian houses , really comparatively close , but somehow looking as inaccessible as a range of marble mountains . On the other side of the lane ran the high gilt railings of a gloomy park . Flambeau was looking round him in rather a weird way . "" Do you know ,"" he said , "" there is something about this place that --"" "" Hullo !"""
chesterton#"called out the Duke sharply ; "" that fellow ' s disappeared . Vanished , like a blasted fairy !"" "" He has a key ,"" explained their clerical friend . "" He ' s only gone into one of these garden doors ,"" and as he spoke they heard one of the dull wooden doors close again with a click in front of them . Flambeau strode up to the door thus shut almost in his face , and stood in front of it for a moment , biting his black moustache in a fury of curiosity . Then he threw up his long arms and swung himself aloft like a monkey and stood on the top of the wall , his enormous figure dark against the purple sky , like the dark tree - tops ."
chesterton#"The Duke looked at the priest . "" Dubosc ' s escape is more elaborate than we thought ,"" he said ; "" but I suppose he is escaping from France ."" "" He is escaping from everywhere ,"" answered Father Brown . Valognes ' s eyes brightened , but his voice sank . "" Do you mean suicide ?"" he asked ."
chesterton#""" You will not find his body ,"" replied the other . A kind of cry came from Flambeau on the wall above . "" My God ,"" he exclaimed in French , "" I know what this place is now ! Why , it ' s the back of the street where old Hirsch lives . I thought I could recognize the back of a house as well as the back of a man ."" "" And Dubosc ' s gone in there !"""
chesterton#"cried the Duke , smiting his hip . "" Why , they ' ll meet after all !"" And with sudden Gallic vivacity he hopped up on the wall beside Flambeau and sat there positively kicking his legs with excitement . The priest alone remained below , leaning against the wall , with his back to the whole theatre of events , and looking wistfully across to the park palings and the twinkling , twilit trees . The Duke , however stimulated , had the instincts of an aristocrat , and desired rather to stare at the house than to spy on it ; but Flambeau , who had the instincts of a burglar ( and a detective ), had already swung himself from the wall into the fork of a straggling tree from which he could crawl quite close to the only illuminated window in the back of the high dark house . A red blind had been pulled down over the light , but pulled crookedly , so that it gaped on one side , and by risking his neck along a branch that looked as treacherous as a twig , Flambeau could just see Colonel Dubosc walking about in a brilliantly - lighted and luxurious bedroom ."
chesterton#"But close as Flambeau was to the house , he heard the words of his colleagues by the wall , and repeated them in a low voice . "" Yes , they will meet now after all !"" "" They will never meet ,"" said Father Brown . "" Hirsch was right when he said that in such an affair the principals must not meet . Have you read a queer psychological story by Henry James , of two persons who so perpetually missed meeting each other by accident that they began to feel quite frightened of each other , and to think it was fate ? This is something of the kind , but more curious ."""
chesterton#""" There are people in Paris who will cure them of such morbid fancies ,"" said Valognes vindictively . "" They will jolly well have to meet if we capture them and force them to fight ."" "" They will not meet on the Day of Judgement ,"" said the priest . "" If God Almighty held the truncheon of the lists , if St Michael blew the trumpet for the swords to cross -- even then , if one of them stood ready , the other would not come ."" "" Oh , what does all this mysticism mean ?"" cried the Duc de Valognes , impatiently ; "" why on earth shouldn ' t they meet like other people ?"""
chesterton#""" They are the opposite of each other ,"" said Father Brown , with a queer kind of smile . "" They contradict each other . They cancel out , so to speak ."" He continued to gaze at the darkening trees opposite , but Valognes turned his head sharply at a suppressed exclamation from Flambeau . That investigator , peering into the lighted room , had just seen the Colonel , after a pace or two , proceed to take his coat off . Flambeau ' s first thought was that this really looked like a fight ; but he soon dropped the thought for another ."
chesterton#The solidity and squareness of Dubosc ' s chest and shoulders was all a powerful piece of padding and came off with his coat . In his shirt and trousers he was a comparatively slim gentleman , who walked across the bedroom to the bathroom with no more pugnacious purpose than that of washing himself . He bent over a basin , dried his dripping hands and face on a towel , and turned again so that the strong light fell on his face . His brown complexion had gone , his big black moustache had gone ; he -- was clean - shaven and very pate . Nothing remained of the Colonel but his bright , hawk - like , brown eyes . Under the wall Father Brown was going on in heavy meditation , as if to himself .
chesterton#""" It is all just like what I was saying to Flambeau . These opposites won ' t do . They don ' t work . They don ' t fight . If it ' s white instead of black , and solid instead of liquid , and so on all along the line -- then there ' s something wrong , Monsieur , there ' s something wrong . One of these men is fair and the other dark , one stout and the other slim , one strong and the other weak ."
chesterton#"One has a moustache and no beard , so you can ' t see his mouth ; the other has a beard and no moustache , so you can ' t see his chin . One has hair cropped to his skull , but a scarf to hide his neck ; the other has low shirt - collars , but long hair to bide his skull . It ' s all too neat and correct , Monsieur , and there ' s something wrong . Things made so opposite are things that cannot quarrel . Wherever the one sticks out the other sinks in . Like a face and a mask , like a lock and a key ..."""
chesterton#Flambeau was peering into the house with a visage as white as a sheet . The occupant of the room was standing with his back to him , but in front of a looking - glass , and had already fitted round his face a sort of framework of rank red hair , hanging disordered from the head and clinging round the jaws and chin while leaving the mocking mouth uncovered . Seen thus in the glass the white face looked like the face of Judas laughing horribly and surrounded by capering flames of hell . For a spasm Flambeau saw the fierce , red - brown eyes dancing , then they were covered with a pair of blue spectacles . Slipping on a loose black coat , the figure vanished towards the front of the house . A few moments later a roar of popular applause from the street beyond announced that Dr Hirsch had once more appeared upon the balcony .
chesterton#IV . The Man in the Passage TWO men appeared simultaneously at the two ends of a sort of passage running along the side of the Apollo Theatre in the Adelphi . The evening daylight in the streets was large and luminous , opalescent and empty . The passage was comparatively long and dark , so each man could see the other as a mere black silhouette at the other end . Nevertheless , each man knew the other , even in that inky outline ; for they were both men of striking appearance and they hated each other .
chesterton#The covered passage opened at one end on one of the steep streets of the Adelphi , and at the other on a terrace overlooking the sunset - coloured river . One side of the passage was a blank wall , for the building it supported was an old unsuccessful theatre restaurant , now shut up . The other side of the passage contained two doors , one at each end . Neither was what was commonly called the stage door ; they were a sort of special and private stage doors used by very special performers , and in this case by the star actor and actress in the Shakespearean performance of the day . Persons of that eminence often like to have such private exits and entrances , for meeting friends or avoiding them . The two men in question were certainly two such friends , men who evidently knew the doors and counted on their opening , for each approached the door at the upper end with equal coolness and confidence .
chesterton#Not , however , with equal speed ; but the man who walked fast was the man from the other end of the tunnel , so they both arrived before the secret stage door almost at the same instant . They saluted each other with civility , and waited a moment before one of them , the sharper walker who seemed to have the shorter patience , knocked at the door . In this and everything else each man was opposite and neither could be called inferior . As private persons both were handsome , capable and popular . As public persons , both were in the first public rank . But everything about them , from their glory to their good looks , was of a diverse and incomparable kind .
chesterton#Sir Wilson Seymour was the kind of man whose importance is known to everybody who knows . The more you mixed with the innermost ring in every polity or profession , the more often you met Sir Wilson Seymour . He was the one intelligent man on twenty unintelligent committees -- on every sort of subject , from the reform of the Royal Academy to the project of bimetallism for Greater Britain . In the Arts especially he was omnipotent . He was so unique that nobody could quite decide whether he was a great aristocrat who had taken up Art , or a great artist whom the aristocrats had taken up . But you could not meet him for five minutes without realizing that you had really been ruled by him all your life .
chesterton#"His appearance was "" distinguished "" in exactly the same sense ; it was at once conventional and unique . Fashion could have found no fault with his high silk hat --, yet it was unlike anyone else ' s hat -- a little higher , perhaps , and adding something to his natural height . His tall , slender figure had a slight stoop yet it looked the reverse of feeble . His hair was silver - grey , but he did not look old ; it was worn longer than the common yet he did not look effeminate ; it was curly but it did not look curled . His carefully pointed beard made him look more manly and militant than otherwise , as it does in those old admirals of Velazquez with whose dark portraits his house was hung . His grey gloves were a shade bluer , his silver - knobbed cane a shade longer than scores of such gloves and canes flapped and flourished about the theatres and the restaurants ."
chesterton#The other man was not so tall , yet would have struck nobody as short , but merely as strong and handsome . His hair also was curly , but fair and cropped close to a strong , massive head -- the sort of head you break a door with , as Chaucer said of the Miller ' s . His military moustache and the carriage of his shoulders showed him a soldier , but he had a pair of those peculiar frank and piercing blue eyes which are more common in sailors . His face was somewhat square , his jaw was square , his shoulders were square , even his jacket was square . Indeed , in the wild school of caricature then current , Mr Max Beerbohm had represented him as a proposition in the fourth book of Euclid . For he also was a public man , though with quite another sort of success .
chesterton#"You did not have to be in the best society to have heard of Captain Cutler , of the siege of Hong - Kong , and the great march across China . You could not get away from hearing of him wherever you were ; his portrait was on every other postcard ; his maps and battles in every other illustrated paper ; songs in his honour in every other music - hall turn or on every other barrel - organ . His fame , though probably more temporary , was ten times more wide , popular and spontaneous than the other man ' s . In thousands of English homes he appeared enormous above England , like Nelson . Yet he had infinitely less power in England than Sir Wilson Seymour . The door was opened to them by an aged servant or "" dresser "", whose broken - down face and figure and black shabby coat and trousers contrasted queerly with the glittering interior of the great actress ' s dressing - room ."
chesterton#It was fitted and filled with looking - glasses at every angle of refraction , so that they looked like the hundred facets of one huge diamond -- if one could get inside a diamond . The other features of luxury , a few flowers , a few coloured cushions , a few scraps of stage costume , were multiplied by all the mirrors into the madness of the Arabian Nights , and danced and changed places perpetually as the shuffling attendant shifted a mirror outwards or shot one back against the wall . They both spoke to the dingy dresser by name , calling him Parkinson , and asking for the lady as Miss Aurora Rome . Parkinson said she was in the other room , but he would go and tell her . A shade crossed the brow of both visitors ; for the other room was the private room of the great actor with whom Miss Aurora was performing , and she was of the kind that does not inflame admiration without inflaming jealousy . In about half a minute , however , the inner door opened , and she entered as she always did , even in private life , so that the very silence seemed to be a roar of applause , and one well - deserved .
chesterton#She was clad in a somewhat strange garb of peacock green and peacock blue satins , that gleamed like blue and green metals , such as delight children and aesthetes , and her heavy , hot brown hair framed one of those magic faces which are dangerous to all men , but especially to boys and to men growing grey . In company with her male colleague , the great American actor , Isidore Bruno , she was producing a particularly poetical and fantastic interpretation of Midsummer Night ' s Dream : in which the artistic prominence was given to Oberon and Titania , or in other words to Bruno and herself . Set in dreamy and exquisite scenery , and moving in mystical dances , the green costume , like burnished beetle - wings , expressed all the elusive individuality of an elfin queen . But when personally confronted in what was still broad daylight , a man looked only at the woman ' s face . She greeted both men with the beaming and baffling smile which kept so many males at the same just dangerous distance from her . She accepted some flowers from Cutler , which were as tropical and expensive as his victories ; and another sort of present from Sir Wilson Seymour , offered later on and more nonchalantly by that gentleman .
chesterton#For it was against his breeding to show eagerness , and against his conventional unconventionality to give anything so obvious as flowers . He had picked up a trifle , he said , which was rather a curiosity , it was an ancient Greek dagger of the Mycenaean Epoch , and might well have been worn in the time of Theseus and Hippolyta . It was made of brass like all the Heroic weapons , but , oddly enough , sharp enough to prick anyone still . He had really been attracted to it by the leaf - like shape ; it was as perfect as a Greek vase . If it was of any interest to Miss Rome or could come in anywhere in the play , he hoped she would -- The inner door burst open and a big figure appeared , who was more of a contrast to the explanatory Seymour than even Captain Cutler .
chesterton#"Nearly six - foot - six , and of more than theatrical thews and muscles , Isidore Bruno , in the gorgeous leopard skin and golden - brown garments of Oberon , looked like a barbaric god . He leaned on a sort of hunting - spear , which across a theatre looked a slight , silvery wand , but which in the small and comparatively crowded room looked as plain as a pike - staff -- and as menacing . His vivid black eyes rolled volcanically , his bronzed face , handsome as it was , showed at that moment a combination of high cheekbones with set white teeth , which recalled certain American conjectures about his origin in the Southern plantations . "" Aurora ,"" he began , in that deep voice like a drum of passion that had moved so many audiences , "" will you --"" He stopped indecisively because a sixth figure had suddenly presented itself just inside the doorway -- a figure so incongruous in the scene as to be almost comic . It was a very short man in the black uniform of the Roman secular clergy , and looking ( especially in such a presence as Bruno ' s and Aurora ' s ) rather like the wooden Noah out of an ark ."
chesterton#"He did not , however , seem conscious of any contrast , but said with dull civility : "" I believe Miss Rome sent for me ."" A shrewd observer might have remarked that the emotional temperature rather rose at so unemotional an interruption . The detachment of a professional celibate seemed to reveal to the others that they stood round the woman as a ring of amorous rivals ; just as a stranger coming in with frost on his coat will reveal that a room is like a furnace . The presence of the one man who did not care about her increased Miss Rome ' s sense that everybody else was in love with her , and each in a somewhat dangerous way : the actor with all the appetite of a savage and a spoilt child ; the soldier with all the simple selfishness of a man of will rather than mind ; Sir Wilson with that daily hardening concentration with which old Hedonists take to a hobby ; nay , even the abject Parkinson , who had known her before her triumphs , and who followed her about the room with eyes or feet , with the dumb fascination of a dog . A shrewd person might also have noted a yet odder thing . The man like a black wooden Noah ( who was not wholly without shrewdness ) noted it with a considerable but contained amusement ."
chesterton#It was evident that the great Aurora , though by no means indifferent to the admiration of the other sex , wanted at this moment to get rid of all the men who admired her and be left alone with the man who did not -- did not admire her in that sense at least ; for the little priest did admire and even enjoy the firm feminine diplomacy with which she set about her task . There was , perhaps , only one thing that Aurora Rome was clever about , and that was one half of humanity -- the other half . The little priest watched , like a Napoleonic campaign , the swift precision of her policy for expelling all while banishing none . Bruno , the big actor , was so babyish that it was easy to send him off in brute sulks , banging the door . Cutler , the British officer , was pachydermatous to ideas , but punctilious about behaviour . He would ignore all hints , but he would die rather than ignore a definite commission from a lady .
chesterton#"As to old Seymour , he had to be treated differently ; he had to be left to the last . The only way to move him was to appeal to him in confidence as an old friend , to let him into the secret of the clearance . The priest did really admire Miss Rome as she achieved all these three objects in one selected action . She went across to Captain Cutler and said in her sweetest manner : "" I shall value all these flowers , because they must be your favourite flowers . But they won ' t be complete , you know , without my favourite flower . Do go over to that shop round the corner and get me some lilies - of - the - valley , and then it will be quite lovely ."""
chesterton#The first object of her diplomacy , the exit of the enraged Bruno , was at once achieved . He had already handed his spear in a lordly style , like a sceptre , to the piteous Parkinson , and was about to assume one of the cushioned seats like a throne . But at this open appeal to his rival there glowed in his opal eyeballs all the sensitive insolence of the slave ; he knotted his enormous brown fists for an instant , and then , dashing open the door , disappeared into his own apartments beyond . But meanwhile Miss Rome ' s experiment in mobilizing the British Army had not succeeded so simply as seemed probable . Cutler had indeed risen stiffly and suddenly , and walked towards the door , hatless , as if at a word of command . But perhaps there was something ostentatiously elegant about the languid figure of Seymour leaning against one of the looking - glasses that brought him up short at the entrance , turning his head this way and that like a bewildered bulldog .
chesterton#""" I must show this stupid man where to go ,"" said Aurora in a whisper to Seymour , and ran out to the threshold to speed the parting guest . Seymour seemed to be listening , elegant and unconscious as was his posture , and he seemed relieved when he heard the lady call out some last instructions to the Captain , and then turn sharply and run laughing down the passage towards the other end , the end on the terrace above the Thames . Yet a second or two after Seymour ' s brow darkened again . A man in his position has so many rivals , and he remembered that at the other end of the passage was the corresponding entrance to Bruno ' s private room . He did not lose his dignity ; he said some civil words to Father Brown about the revival of Byzantine architecture in the Westminster Cathedral , and then , quite naturally , strolled out himself into the upper end of the passage . Father Brown and Parkinson were left alone , and they were neither of them men with a taste for superfluous conversation ."
chesterton#The dresser went round the room , pulling out looking - glasses and pushing them in again , his dingy dark coat and trousers looking all the more dismal since he was still holding the festive fairy spear of King Oberon . Every time he pulled out the frame of a new glass , a new black figure of Father Brown appeared ; the absurd glass chamber was full of Father Browns , upside down in the air like angels , turning somersaults like acrobats , turning their backs to everybody like very rude persons . Father Brown seemed quite unconscious of this cloud of witnesses , but followed Parkinson with an idly attentive eye till he took himself and his absurd spear into the farther room of Bruno . Then he abandoned himself to such abstract meditations as always amused him -- calculating the angles of the mirrors , the angles of each refraction , the angle at which each must fit into the wall ... when he heard a strong but strangled cry . He sprang to his feet and stood rigidly listening . At the same instant Sir Wilson Seymour burst back into the room , white as ivory .
chesterton#""" Who ' s that man in the passage ?"" he cried . "" Where ' s that dagger of mine ?"" Before Father Brown could turn in his heavy boots Seymour was plunging about the room looking for the weapon . And before he could possibly find that weapon or any other , a brisk running of feet broke upon the pavement outside , and the square face of Cutler was thrust into the same doorway . He was still grotesquely grasping a bunch of lilies - of - the - valley ."
chesterton#""" What ' s this ?"" he cried . "" What ' s that creature down the passage ? Is this some of your tricks ?"" "" My tricks !"" hissed his pale rival , and made a stride towards him ."
chesterton#"In the instant of time in which all this happened Father Brown stepped out into the top of the passage , looked down it , and at once walked briskly towards what he saw . At this the other two men dropped their quarrel and darted after him , Cutler calling out : "" What are you doing ? Who are you ?"" "" My name is Brown ,"" said the priest sadly , as he bent over something and straightened himself again . "" Miss Rome sent for me , and I came as quickly as I could . I have come too late ."""
chesterton#The three men looked down , and in one of them at least the life died in that late light of afternoon . It ran along the passage like a path of gold , and in the midst of it Aurora Rome lay lustrous in her robes of green and gold , with her dead face turned upwards . Her dress was torn away as in a struggle , leaving the right shoulder bare , but the wound from which the blood was welling was on the other side . The brass dagger lay flat and gleaming a yard or so away . There was a blank stillness for a measurable time , so that they could hear far off a flower - girl ' s laugh outside Charing Cross , and someone whistling furiously for a taxicab in one of the streets off the Strand . Then the Captain , with a movement so sudden that it might have been passion or play - acting , took Sir Wilson Seymour by the throat .
chesterton#"Seymour looked at him steadily without either fight or fear . "" You need not kill me ,"" he said in a voice quite cold ; "" I shall do that on my own account ."" The Captain ' s hand hesitated and dropped ; and the other added with the same icy candour : "" If I find I haven ' t the nerve to do it with that dagger I can do it in a month with drink ."" "" Drink isn ' t good enough for me ,"" replied Cutler , "" but I ' ll have blood for this before I die . Not yours -- but I think I know whose ."" And before the others could appreciate his intention he snatched up the dagger , sprang at the other door at the lower end of the passage , burst it open , bolt and all , and confronted Bruno in his dressing - room ."
chesterton#As he did so , old Parkinson tottered in his wavering way out of the door and caught sight of the corpse lying in the passage . He moved shakily towards it ; looked at it weakly with a working face ; then moved shakily back into the dressing - room again , and sat down suddenly on one of the richly cushioned chairs . Father Brown instantly ran across to him , taking no notice of Cutler and the colossal actor , though the room already rang with their blows and they began to struggle for the dagger . Seymour , who retained some practical sense , was whistling for the police at the end of the passage . When the police arrived it was to tear the two men from an almost ape - like grapple ; and , after a few formal inquiries , to arrest Isidore Bruno upon a charge of murder , brought against him by his furious opponent . The idea that the great national hero of the hour had arrested a wrongdoer with his own hand doubtless had its weight with the police , who are not without elements of the journalist .
chesterton#"They treated Cutler with a certain solemn attention , and pointed out that he had got a slight slash on the hand . Even as Cutler bore him back across tilted chair and table , Bruno had twisted the dagger out of his grasp and disabled him just below the wrist . The injury was really slight , but till he was removed from the room the half - savage prisoner stared at the running blood with a steady smile . "" Looks a cannibal sort of chap , don ' t he ?"" said the constable confidentially to Cutler . Cutler made no answer , but said sharply a moment after : "" We must attend to the ... the death ..."" and his voice escaped from articulation ."
chesterton#""" The two deaths ,"" came in the voice of the priest from the farther side of the room . "" This poor fellow was gone when I got across to him ."" And he stood looking down at old Parkinson , who sat in a black huddle on the gorgeous chair . He also had paid his tribute , not without eloquence , to the woman who had died . The silence was first broken by Cutler , who seemed not untouched by a rough tenderness . "" I wish I was him ,"" he said huskily ."
chesterton#""" I remember he used to watch her wherever she walked more than -- anybody . She was his air , and he ' s dried up . He ' s just dead ."" "" We are all dead ,"" said Seymour in a strange voice , looking down the road . They took leave of Father Brown at the corner of the road , with some random apologies for any rudeness they might have shown . Both their faces were tragic , but also cryptic ."
chesterton#"The mind of the little priest was always a rabbit - warren of wild thoughts that jumped too quickly for him to catch them . Like the white tail of a rabbit he had the vanishing thought that he was certain of their grief , but not so certain of their innocence . "" We had better all be going ,"" said Seymour heavily ; "" we have done all we can to help ."" "" Will you understand my motives ,"" asked Father Brown quietly , "" if I say you have done all you can to hurt ?"" They both started as if guiltily , and Cutler said sharply : "" To hurt whom ?"" "" To hurt yourselves ,"" answered the priest ."
chesterton#""" I would not add to your troubles if it weren ' t common justice to warn you . You ' ve done nearly everything you could do to hang yourselves , if this actor should be acquitted . They ' ll be sure to subpoena me ; I shall be bound to say that after the cry was heard each of you rushed into the room in a wild state and began quarrelling about a dagger . As far as my words on oath can go , you might either of you have done it . You hurt yourselves with that ; and then Captain Cutler must have hurt himself with the dagger ."" "" Hurt myself !"""
chesterton#"exclaimed the Captain , with contempt . "" A silly little scratch ."" "" Which drew blood ,"" replied the priest , nodding . "" We know there ' s blood on the brass now . And so we shall never know whether there was blood on it before ."" There was a silence ; and then Seymour said , with an emphasis quite alien to his daily accent : "" But I saw a man in the passage ."""
chesterton#""" I know you did ,"" answered the cleric Brown with a face of wood , "" so did Captain Cutler . That ' s what seems so improbable ."" Before either could make sufficient sense of it even to answer , Father Brown had politely excused himself and gone stumping up the road with his stumpy old umbrella . As modern newspapers are conducted , the most honest and most important news is the police news . If it be true that in the twentieth century more space is given to murder than to politics , it is for the excellent reason that murder is a more serious subject . But even this would hardly explain the enormous omnipresence and widely distributed detail of "" The Bruno Case ,"" or "" The Passage Mystery ,"" in the Press of London and the provinces ."
chesterton#So vast was the excitement that for some weeks the Press really told the truth ; and the reports of examination and cross - examination , if interminable , even if intolerable are at least reliable . The true reason , of course , was the coincidence of persons . The victim was a popular actress ; the accused was a popular actor ; and the accused had been caught red - handed , as it were , by the most popular soldier of the patriotic season . In those extraordinary circumstances the Press was paralysed into probity and accuracy ; and the rest of this somewhat singular business can practically be recorded from reports of Bruno ' s trial . The trial was presided over by Mr Justice Monkhouse , one of those who are jeered at as humorous judges , but who are generally much more serious than the serious judges , for their levity comes from a living impatience of professional solemnity ; while the serious judge is really filled with frivolity , because he is filled with vanity . All the chief actors being of a worldly importance , the barristers were well balanced ; the prosecutor for the Crown was Sir Walter Cowdray , a heavy , but weighty advocate of the sort that knows how to seem English and trustworthy , and how to be rhetorical with reluctance .
chesterton#The prisoner was defended by Mr Patrick Butler , K . C ., who was mistaken for a mere flaneur by those who misunderstood the Irish character -- and those who had not been examined by him . The medical evidence involved no contradictions , the doctor , whom Seymour had summoned on the spot , agreeing with the eminent surgeon who had later examined the body . Aurora Rome had been stabbed with some sharp instrument such as a knife or dagger ; some instrument , at least , of which the blade was short . The wound was just over the heart , and she had died instantly . When the doctor first saw her she could hardly have been dead for twenty minutes . Therefore when Father Brown found her she could hardly have been dead for three .
chesterton#Some official detective evidence followed , chiefly concerned with the presence or absence of any proof of a struggle ; the only suggestion of this was the tearing of the dress at the shoulder , and this did not seem to fit in particularly well with the direction and finality of the blow . When these details had been supplied , though not explained , the first of the important witnesses was called . Sir Wilson Seymour gave evidence as he did everything else that he did at all -- not only well , but perfectly . Though himself much more of a public man than the judge , he conveyed exactly the fine shade of self - effacement before the King ' s justice ; and though everyone looked at him as they would at the Prime Minister or the Archbishop of Canterbury , they could have said nothing of his part in it but that it was that of a private gentleman , with an accent on the noun . He was also refreshingly lucid , as he was on the committees . He had been calling on Miss Rome at the theatre ; he had met Captain Cutler there ; they had been joined for a short time by the accused , who had then returned to his own dressing - room ; they had then been joined by a Roman Catholic priest , who asked for the deceased lady and said his name was Brown .
chesterton#Miss Rome had then gone just outside the theatre to the entrance of the passage , in order to point out to Captain Cutler a flower - shop at which he was to buy her some more flowers ; and the witness had remained in the room , exchanging a few words with the priest . He had then distinctly heard the deceased , having sent the Captain on his errand , turn round laughing and run down the passage towards its other end , where was the prisoner ' s dressing - room . In idle curiosity as to the rapid movement of his friends , he had strolled out to the head of the passage himself and looked down it towards the prisoner ' s door . Did he see anything in the passage ? Yes ; he saw something in the passage . Sir Walter Cowdray allowed an impressive interval , during which the witness looked down , and for all his usual composure seemed to have more than his usual pallor .
chesterton#"Then the barrister said in a lower voice , which seemed at once sympathetic and creepy : "" Did you see it distinctly ?"" Sir Wilson Seymour , however moved , had his excellent brains in full working - order . "" Very distinctly as regards its outline , but quite indistinctly , indeed not at all , as regards the details inside the outline . The passage is of such length that anyone in the middle of it appears quite black against the light at the other end ."" The witness lowered his steady eyes once more and added : "" I had noticed the fact before , when Captain Cutler first entered it ."" There was another silence , and the judge leaned forward and made a note ."
chesterton#""" Well ,"" said Sir Walter patiently , "" what was the outline like ? Was it , for instance , like the figure of the murdered woman ?"" "" Not in the least ,"" answered Seymour quietly . "" What did it look like to you ?"" "" It looked to me ,"" replied the witness , "" like a tall man ."" Everyone in court kept his eyes riveted on his pen , or his umbrella - handle , or his book , or his boots or whatever he happened to be looking at ."
chesterton#"They seemed to be holding their eyes away from the prisoner by main force ; but they felt his figure in the dock , and they felt it as gigantic . Tall as Bruno was to the eye , he seemed to swell taller and taller when an eyes had been torn away from him . Cowdray was resuming his seat with his solemn face , smoothing his black silk robes , and white silk whiskers . Sir Wilson was leaving the witness - box , after a few final particulars to which there were many other witnesses , when the counsel for the defence sprang up and stopped him . "" I shall only detain you a moment ,"" said Mr Butler , who was a rustic - looking person with red eyebrows and an expression of partial slumber . "" Will you tell his lordship how you knew it was a man ?"""
chesterton#"A faint , refined smile seemed to pass over Seymour ' s features . "" I ' m afraid it is the vulgar test of trousers ,"" he said . "" When I saw daylight between the long legs I was sure it was a man , after all ."" Butler ' s sleepy eyes opened as suddenly as some silent explosion . "" After all !"" he repeated slowly ."
chesterton#""" So you did think at first it was a woman ?"" Seymour looked troubled for the first time . "" It is hardly a point of fact ,"" he said , "" but if his lordship would like me to answer for my impression , of course I shall do so . There was something about the thing that was not exactly a woman and yet was not quite a man ; somehow the curves were different . And it had something that looked like long hair ."" "" Thank you ,"" said Mr Butler , K . C ., and sat down suddenly , as if he had got what he wanted ."
chesterton#Captain Cutler was a far less plausible and composed witness than Sir Wilson , but his account of the opening incidents was solidly the same . He described the return of Bruno to his dressing - room , the dispatching of himself to buy a bunch of lilies - of - the - valley , his return to the upper end of the passage , the thing he saw in the passage , his suspicion of Seymour , and his struggle with Bruno . But he could give little artistic assistance about the black figure that he and Seymour had seen . Asked about its outline , he said he was no art critic -- with a somewhat too obvious sneer at Seymour . Asked if it was a man or a woman , he said it looked more like a beast -- with a too obvious snarl at the prisoner . But the man was plainly shaken with sorrow and sincere anger , and Cowdray quickly excused him from confirming facts that were already fairly clear .
chesterton#"The defending counsel also was again brief in his cross - examination ; although ( as was his custom ) even in being brief , he seemed to take a long time about it . "" You used a rather remarkable expression ,"" he said , looking at Cutler sleepily . "" What do you mean by saying that it looked more like a beast than a man or a woman ?"" Cutler seemed seriously agitated . "" Perhaps I oughtn ' t to have said that ,"" he said ; "" but when the brute has huge humped shoulders like a chimpanzee , and bristles sticking out of its head like a pig --"" Mr Butler cut short his curious impatience in the middle ."
chesterton#""" Never mind whether its hair was like a pig ' s ,"" he said , "" was it like a woman ' s ?"" "" A woman ' s !"" cried the soldier . "" Great Scott , no !"" "" The last witness said it was ,"" commented the counsel , with unscrupulous swiftness . "" And did the figure have any of those serpentine and semi - feminine curves to which eloquent allusion has been made ?"
chesterton#"No ? No feminine curves ? The figure , if I understand you , was rather heavy and square than otherwise ?"" "" He may have been bending forward ,"" said Cutler , in a hoarse and rather faint voice . "" Or again , he may not ,"" said Mr Butler , and sat down suddenly for the second time . The third , witness called by Sir Walter Cowdray was the little Catholic clergyman , so little , compared with the others , that his head seemed hardly to come above the box , so that it was like cross - examining a child ."
chesterton#"But unfortunately Sir Walter had somehow got it into his head ( mostly by some ramifications of his family ' s religion ) that Father Brown was on the side of the prisoner , because the prisoner was wicked and foreign and even partly black . Therefore he took Father Brown up sharply whenever that proud pontiff tried to explain anything ; and told him to answer yes or no , and tell the plain facts without any jesuitry . When Father Brown began , in his simplicity , to say who he thought the man in the passage was , the barrister told him that he did not want his theories . "" A black shape was seen in the passage . And you say you saw the black shape . Well , what shape was it ?"""
chesterton#"Father Brown blinked as under rebuke ; but he had long known the literal nature of obedience . "" The shape ,"" he said , "" was short and thick , but had two sharp , black projections curved upwards on each side of the head or top , rather like horns , and --"" "" Oh ! the devil with horns , no doubt ,"" ejaculated Cowdray , sitting down in triumphant jocularity . "" It was the devil come to eat Protestants ."" "" No ,"" said the priest dispassionately ; "" I know who it was ."""
chesterton#"Those in court had been wrought up to an irrational , but real sense of some monstrosity . They had forgotten the figure in the dock and thought only of the figure in the passage . And the figure in the passage , described by three capable and respectable men who had all seen it , was a shifting nightmare : one called it a woman , and the other a beast , and the other a devil .... The judge was looking at Father Brown with level and piercing eyes . "" You are a most extraordinary witness ,"" he said ; "" but there is something about you that makes me think you are trying to tell the truth . Well , who was the man you saw in the passage ?"""
chesterton#""" He was myself ,"" said Father Brown . Butler , K . C ., sprang to his feet in an extraordinary stillness , and said quite calmly : "" Your lordship will allow me to cross - examine ?"" And then , without stopping , he shot at Brown the apparently disconnected question : "" You have heard about this dagger ; you know the experts say the crime was committed with a short blade ?"" "" A short blade ,"" assented Brown , nodding solemnly like an owl , "" but a very long hilt ."" Before the audience could quite dismiss the idea that the priest had really seen himself doing murder with a short dagger with a long hilt ( which seemed somehow to make it more horrible ), he had himself hurried on to explain . "" I mean daggers aren ' t the only things with short blades ."
chesterton#"Spears have short blades . And spears catch at the end of the steel just like daggers , if they ' re that sort of fancy spear they had in theatres ; like the spear poor old Parkinson killed his wife with , just when she ' d sent for me to settle their family troubles -- and I came just too late , God forgive me ! But he died penitent -- he just died of being penitent . He couldn ' t bear what he ' d done ."" The general impression in court was that the little priest , who was gobbling away , had literally gone mad in the box . But the judge still looked at him with bright and steady eyes of interest ; and the counsel for the defence went on with his questions unperturbed ."
chesterton#""" If Parkinson did it with that pantomime spear ,"" said Butler , "" he must have thrust from four yards away . How do you account for signs of struggle , like the dress dragged off the shoulder ?"" He had slipped into treating his mere witness as an expert ; but no one noticed it now . "" The poor lady ' s dress was torn ,"" said the witness , "" because it was caught in a panel that slid to just behind her . She struggled to free herself , and as she did so Parkinson came out of the prisoner ' s room and lunged with the spear ."" "" A panel ?"""
chesterton#"repeated the barrister in a curious voice . "" It was a looking - glass on the other side ,"" explained Father Brown . "" When I was in the dressing - room I noticed that some of them could probably be slid out into the passage ."" There was another vast and unnatural silence , and this time it was the judge who spoke . "" So you really mean that when you looked down that passage , the man you saw was yourself -- in a mirror ?"" "" Yes , my lord ; that was what I was trying to say ,"" said Brown , "" but they asked me for the shape ; and our hats have corners just like horns , and so I --"""
chesterton#"The judge leaned forward , his old eyes yet more brilliant , and said in specially distinct tones : "" Do you really mean to say that when Sir Wilson Seymour saw that wild what - you - call - him with curves and a woman ' s hair and a man ' s trousers , what he saw was Sir Wilson Seymour ?"" "" Yes , my lord ,"" said Father Brown . "" And you mean to say that when Captain Cutler saw that chimpanzee with humped shoulders and hog ' s bristles , he simply saw himself ?"" "" Yes , my lord ."" The judge leaned back in his chair with a luxuriance in which it was hard to separate the cynicism and the admiration . "" And can you tell us why ,"" he asked , "" you should know your own figure in a looking - glass , when two such distinguished men don ' t ?"""
chesterton#"Father Brown blinked even more painfully than before ; then he stammered : "" Really , my lord , I don ' t know unless it ' s because I don ' t look at it so often ."" V . The Mistake of the Machine FLAMBEAU and his friend the priest were sitting in the Temple Gardens about sunset ; and their neighbourhood or some such accidental influence had turned their talk to matters of legal process . From the problem of the licence in cross - examination , their talk strayed to Roman and mediaeval torture , to the examining magistrate in France and the Third Degree in America . "" I ' ve been reading ,"" said Flambeau , "" of this new psychometric method they talk about so much , especially in America . You know what I mean ; they put a pulsometer on a man ' s wrist and judge by how his heart goes at the pronunciation of certain words ."
chesterton#"What do you think of it ?"" "" I think it very interesting ,"" replied Father Brown ; "" it reminds me of that interesting idea in the Dark Ages that blood would flow from a corpse if the murderer touched it ."" "" Do you really mean ,"" demanded his friend , "" that you think the two methods equally valuable ?"" "" I think them equally valueless ,"" replied Brown . "" Blood flows , fast or slow , in dead folk or living , for so many more million reasons than we can ever know . Blood will have to flow very funnily ; blood will have to flow up the Matterhorn , before I will take it as a sign that I am to shed it ."""
chesterton#""" The method ,"" remarked the other , "" has been guaranteed by some of the greatest American men of science ."" "" What sentimentalists men of science are !"" exclaimed Father Brown , "" and how much more sentimental must American men of science be ! Who but a Yankee would think of proving anything from heart - throbs ? Why , they must be as sentimental as a man who thinks a woman is in love with him if she blushes . That ' s a test from the circulation of the blood , discovered by the immortal Harvey ; and a jolly rotten test , too ."""
chesterton#""" But surely ,"" insisted Flambeau , "" it might point pretty straight at something or other ."" "" There ' s a disadvantage in a stick pointing straight ,"" answered the other . "" What is it ? Why , the other end of the stick always points the opposite way . It depends whether you get hold of the stick by the right end . I saw the thing done once and I ' ve never believed in it since ."""
chesterton#And he proceeded to tell the story of his disillusionment . It happened nearly twenty years before , when he was chaplain to his co - religionists in a prison in Chicago -- where the Irish population displayed a capacity both for crime and penitence which kept him tolerably busy . The official second - in - command under the Governor was an ex - detective named Greywood Usher , a cadaverous , careful - spoken Yankee philosopher , occasionally varying a very rigid visage with an odd apologetic grimace . He liked Father Brown in a slightly patronizing way ; and Father Brown liked him , though he heartily disliked his theories . His theories were extremely complicated and were held with extreme simplicity . One evening he had sent for the priest , who , according to his custom , took a seat in silence at a table piled and littered with papers , and waited .
chesterton#"The official selected from the papers a scrap of newspaper cutting , which he handed across to the cleric , who read it gravely . It appeared to be an extract from one of the pinkest of American Society papers , and ran as follows : "" Society ' s brightest widower is once more on the Freak Dinner stunt . All our exclusive citizens will recall the Perambulator Parade Dinner , in which Last - Trick Todd , at his palatial home at Pilgrim ' s Pond , caused so many of our prominent debutantes to look even younger than their years . Equally elegant and more miscellaneous and large - hearted in social outlook was Last - Trick ' s show the year previous , the popular Cannibal Crush Lunch , at which the confections handed round were sarcastically moulded in the forms of human arms and legs , and during which more than one of our gayest mental gymnasts was heard offering to eat his partner . The witticism which will inspire this evening is as yet in Mr Todd ' s pretty reticent intellect , or locked in the jewelled bosoms of our city ' s gayest leaders ; but there is talk of a pretty parody of the simple manners and customs at the other end of Society ' s scale ."
chesterton#"This would be all the more telling , as hospitable Todd is entertaining in Lord Falconroy , the famous traveller , a true - blooded aristocrat fresh from England ' s oak - groves . Lord Falconroy ' s travels began before his ancient feudal title was resurrected , he was in the Republic in his youth , and fashion murmurs a sly reason for his return . Miss Etta Todd is one of our deep - souled New Yorkers , and comes into an income of nearly twelve hundred million dollars ."" "" Well ,"" asked Usher , "" does that interest you ?"" "" Why , words rather fail me ,"" answered Father Brown . "" I cannot think at this moment of anything in this world that would interest me less ."
chesterton#"And , unless the just anger of the Republic is at last going to electrocute journalists for writing like that , I don ' t quite see why it should interest you either ."" "" Ah !"" said Mr Usher dryly , and handing across another scrap of newspaper . "" Well , does that interest you ?"" The paragraph was headed "" Savage Murder of a Warder . Convict Escapes ,"" and ran : "" Just before dawn this morning a shout for help was heard in the Convict Settlement at Sequah in this State ."
chesterton#The authorities , hurrying in the direction of the cry , found the corpse of the warder who patrols the top of the north wall of the prison , the steepest and most difficult exit , for which one man has always been found sufficient . The unfortunate officer had , however , been hurled from the high wall , his brains beaten out as with a club , and his gun was missing . Further inquiries showed that one of the cells was empty ; it had been occupied by a rather sullen ruffian giving his name as Oscar Rian . He was only temporarily detained for some comparatively trivial assault ; but he gave everyone the impression of a man with a black past and a dangerous future . Finally , when daylight bad fully revealed the scene of murder , it was found that he had written on the wall above the body a fragmentary sentence , apparently with a finger dipped in blood : ` This was self - defence and he had the gun . I meant no harm to him or any man but one .
chesterton#"I am keeping the bullet for Pilgrim ' s Pond -- O . R .' A man must have used most fiendish treachery or most savage and amazing bodily daring to have stormed such a wall in spite of an armed man ."" "" Well , the literary style is somewhat improved ,"" admitted the priest cheerfully , "" but still I don ' t see what I can do for you . I should cut a poor figure , with my short legs , running about this State after an athletic assassin of that sort . I doubt whether anybody could find him . The convict settlement at Sequah is thirty miles from here ; the country between is wild and tangled enough , and the country beyond , where he will surely have the sense to go , is a perfect no - man ' s land tumbling away to the prairies ."
chesterton#"He may be in any hole or up any tree ."" "" He isn ' t in any hole ,"" said the governor ; "" he isn ' t up any tree ."" "" Why , how do you know ?"" asked Father Brown , blinking . "" Would you like to speak to him ?"" inquired Usher ."
chesterton#"Father Brown opened his innocent eyes wide . "" He is here ?"" he exclaimed . "" Why , how did your men get hold of him ?"" "" I got hold of him myself ,"" drawled the American , rising and lazily stretching his lanky legs before the fire . "" I got hold of him with the crooked end of a walking - stick ."
chesterton#Don ' t look so surprised . I really did . You know I sometimes take a turn in the country lanes outside this dismal place ; well , I was walking early this evening up a steep lane with dark hedges and grey - looking ploughed fields on both sides ; and a young moon was up and silvering the road . By the light of it I saw a man running across the field towards the road ; running with his body bent and at a good mile - race trot . He appeared to be much exhausted ; but when he came to the thick black hedge he went through it as if it were made of spiders ' webs ; -- or rather ( for I heard the strong branches breaking and snapping like bayonets ) as if he himself were made of stone . In the instant in which he appeared up against the moon , crossing the road , I slung my hooked cane at his legs , tripping him and bringing him down .
chesterton#"Then I blew my whistle long and loud , and our fellows came running up to secure him ."" "" It would have been rather awkward ,"" remarked Brown , "" if you had found he was a popular athlete practising a mile race ."" "" He was not ,"" said Usher grimly . "" We soon found out who he was ; but I had guessed it with the first glint of the moon on him ."" "" You thought it was the runaway convict ,"" observed the priest simply , "" because you had read in the newspaper cutting that morning that a convict had run away ."" "" I had somewhat better grounds ,"" replied the governor coolly ."
chesterton#""" I pass over the first as too simple to be emphasized -- I mean that fashionable athletes do not run across ploughed fields or scratch their eyes out in bramble hedges . Nor do they run all doubled up like a crouching dog . There were more decisive details to a fairly well - trained eye . The man was clad in coarse and ragged clothes , but they were something more than merely coarse and ragged . They were so ill - fitting as to be quite grotesque ; even as he appeared in black outline against the moonrise , the coat - collar in which his head was buried made him look like a hunchback , and the long loose sleeves looked as if he had no hands . It at once occurred to me that he had somehow managed to change his convict clothes for some confederate ' s clothes which did not fit him ."
chesterton#"Second , there was a pretty stiff wind against which he was running ; so that I must have seen the streaky look of blowing hair , if the hair had not been very short . Then I remembered that beyond these ploughed fields he was crossing lay Pilgrim ' s Pond , for which ( you will remember ) the convict was keeping his bullet ; and I sent my walking - stick flying ."" "" A brilliant piece of rapid deduction ,"" said Father Brown ; "" but had he got a gun ?"" As Usher stopped abruptly in his walk the priest added apologetically : "" I ' ve been told a bullet is not half so useful without it ."" "" He had no gun ,"" said the other gravely ; "" but that was doubtless due to some very natural mischance or change of plans . Probably the same policy that made him change the clothes made him drop the gun ; he began to repent the coat he had left behind him in the blood of his victim ."""
chesterton#""" Well , that is possible enough ,"" answered the priest . "" And it ' s hardly worth speculating on ,"" said Usher , turning to some other papers , "" for we know it ' s the man by this time ."" His clerical friend asked faintly : "" But how ?"" And Greywood Usher threw down the newspapers and took up the two press - cuttings again . "" Well , since you are so obstinate ,"" he said , "" let ' s begin at the beginning . You will notice that these two cuttings have only one thing in common , which is the mention of Pilgrim ' s Pond , the estate , as you know , of the millionaire Ireton Todd ."
chesterton#"You also know that he is a remarkable character ; one of those that rose on stepping - stones --"" "" Of our dead selves to higher things ,"" assented his companion . "" Yes ; I know that . Petroleum , I think ."" "" Anyhow ,"" said Usher , "" Last - Trick Todd counts for a great deal in this rum affair ."" He stretched himself once more before the fire and continued talking in his expansive , radiantly explanatory style ."
chesterton#""" To begin with , on the face of it , there is no mystery here at all . It is not mysterious , it is not even odd , that a jailbird should take his gun to Pilgrim ' s Pond . Our people aren ' t like the English , who will forgive a man for being rich if he throws away money on hospitals or horses . Last - Trick Todd has made himself big by his own considerable abilities ; and there ' s no doubt that many of those on whom he has shown his abilities would like to show theirs on him with a shot - gun . Todd might easily get dropped by some man he ' d never even heard of ; some labourer he ' d locked out , or some clerk in a business he ' d busted . Last - Trick is a man of mental endowments and a high public character ; but in this country the relations of employers and employed are considerably strained ."
chesterton#""" That ' s how the whole thing looks supposing this Rian made for Pilgrim ' s Pond to kill Todd . So it looked to me , till another little discovery woke up what I have of the detective in me . When I had my prisoner safe , I picked up my cane again and strolled down the two or three turns of country road that brought me to one of the side entrances of Todd ' s grounds , the one nearest to the pool or lake after which the place is named . It was some two hours ago , about seven by this time ; the moonlight was more luminous , and I could see the long white streaks of it lying on the mysterious mere with its grey , greasy , half - liquid shores in which they say our fathers used to make witches walk until they sank . I ' d forgotten the exact tale ; but you know the place I mean ; it lies north of Todd ' s house towards the wilderness , and has two queer wrinkled trees , so dismal that they look more like huge fungoids than decent foliage . As I stood peering at this misty pool , I fancied I saw the faint figure of a man moving from the house towards it , but it was all too dim and distant for one to be certain of the fact , and still less of the details ."
chesterton#Besides , my attention was very sharply arrested by something much closer . I crouched behind the fence which ran not more than two hundred yards from one wing of the great mansion , and which was fortunately split in places , as if specially for the application of a cautious eye . A door had opened in the dark bulk of the left wing , and a figure appeared black against the illuminated interior -- a muffled figure bending forward , evidently peering out into the night . It closed the door behind it , and I saw it was carrying a lantern , which threw a patch of imperfect light on the dress and figure of the wearer . It seemed to be the figure of a woman , wrapped up in a ragged cloak and evidently disguised to avoid notice ; there was something very strange both about the rags and the furtiveness in a person coming out of those rooms lined with gold . She took cautiously the curved garden path which brought her within half a hundred yards of me --, then she stood up for an instant on the terrace of turf that looks towards the slimy lake , and holding her flaming lantern above her head she deliberately swung it three times to and fro as for a signal .
chesterton#"As she swung it the second time a flicker of its light fell for a moment on her own face , a face that I knew . She was unnaturally pale , and her head was bundled in her borrowed plebeian shawl ; but I am certain it was Etta Todd , the millionaire ' s daughter . "" She retraced her steps in equal secrecy and the door closed behind her again . I was about to climb the fence and follow , when I realized that the detective fever that had lured me into the adventure was rather undignified ; and that in a more authoritative capacity I already held all the cards in my hand . I was just turning away when a new noise broke on the night . A window was thrown up in one of the upper floors , but just round the corner of the house so that I could not see it ; and a voice of terrible distinctness was heard shouting across the dark garden to know where Lord Falconroy was , for he was missing from every room in the house ."
chesterton#There was no mistaking that voice . I have heard it on many a political platform or meeting of directors ; it was Ireton Todd himself . Some of the others seemed to have gone to the lower windows or on to the steps , and were calling up to him that Falconroy had gone for a stroll down to the Pilgrim ' s Pond an hour before , and could not be traced since . Then Todd cried ` Mighty Murder !' and shut down the window violently ; and I could hear him plunging down the stairs inside . Repossessing myself of my former and wiser purpose , I whipped out of the way of the general search that must follow ; and returned here not later than eight o ' clock .
chesterton#""" I now ask you to recall that little Society paragraph which seemed to you so painfully lacking in interest . If the convict was not keeping the shot for Todd , as he evidently wasn ' t , it is most likely that he was keeping it for Lord Falconroy ; and it looks as if he had delivered the goods . No more handy place to shoot a man than in the curious geological surroundings of that pool , where a body thrown down would sink through thick slime to a depth practically unknown . Let us suppose , then , that our friend with the cropped hair came to kill Falconroy and not Todd . But , as I have pointed out , there are many reasons why people in America might want to kill Todd . There is no reason why anybody in America should want to kill an English lord newly landed , except for the one reason mentioned in the pink paper -- that the lord is paying his attentions to the millionaire ' s daughter ."
chesterton#"Our crop - haired friend , despite his ill - fitting clothes , must be an aspiring lover . "" I know the notion will seem to you jarring and even comic ; but that ' s because you are English . It sounds to you like saying the Archbishop of Canterbury ' s daughter will be married in St George ' s , Hanover Square , to a crossing - sweeper on ticket - of - leave . You don ' t do justice to the climbing and aspiring power of our more remarkable citizens . You see a good - looking grey - haired man in evening - dress with a sort of authority about him , you know he is a pillar of the State , and you fancy he had a father . You are in error ."
chesterton#"You do not realize that a comparatively few years ago he may have been in a tenement or ( quite likely ) in a jail . You don ' t allow for our national buoyancy and uplift . Many of our most influential citizens have not only risen recently , but risen comparatively late in life . Todd ' s daughter was fully eighteen when her father first made his pile ; so there isn ' t really anything impossible in her having a hanger - on in low life ; or even in her hanging on to him , as I think she must be doing , to judge by the lantern business . If so , the hand that held the lantern may not be unconnected with the hand that held the gun . This case , sir , will make a noise ."""
chesterton#""" Well ,"" said the priest patiently , "" and what did you do next ?"" "" I reckon you ' ll be shocked ,"" replied Greywood Usher , "" as I know you don ' t cotton to the march of science in these matters . I am given a good deal of discretion here , and perhaps take a little more than I ' m given ; and I thought it was an excellent opportunity to test that Psychometric Machine I told you about . Now , in my opinion , that machine can ' t lie ."" "" No machine can lie ,"" said Father Brown ; "" nor can it tell the truth ."" "" It did in this case , as I ' ll show you ,"" went on Usher positively ."
chesterton#""" I sat the man in the ill - fitting clothes in a comfortable chair , and simply wrote words on a blackboard ; and the machine simply recorded the variations of his pulse ; and I simply observed his manner . The trick is to introduce some word connected with the supposed crime in a list of words connected with something quite different , yet a list in which it occurs quite naturally . Thus I wrote ` heron ' and ` eagle ' and ` owl ', and when I wrote ` falcon ' he was tremendously agitated ; and when I began to make an ` r ' at the end of the word , that machine just bounded . Who else in this republic has any reason to jump at the name of a newly - arrived Englishman like Falconroy except the man who ' s shot him ? Isn ' t that better evidence than a lot of gabble from witnesses -- if the evidence of a reliable machine ?"" "" You always forget ,"" observed his companion , "" that the reliable machine always has to be worked by an unreliable machine ."""
chesterton#""" Why , what do you mean ?"" asked the detective . "" I mean Man ,"" said Father Brown , "" the most unreliable machine I know of . I don ' t want to be rude ; and I don ' t think you will consider Man to be an offensive or inaccurate description of yourself . You say you observed his manner ; but how do you know you observed it right ? You say the words have to come in a natural way ; but how do you know that you did it naturally ?"
chesterton#"How do you know , if you come to that , that he did not observe your manner ? Who is to prove that you were not tremendously agitated ? There was no machine tied on to your pulse ."" "" I tell you ,"" cried the American in the utmost excitement , "" I was as cool as a cucumber ."" "" Criminals also can be as cool as cucumbers ,"" said Brown with a smile . "" And almost as cool as you ."""
chesterton#""" Well , this one wasn ' t ,"" said Usher , throwing the papers about . "" Oh , you make me tired !"" "" I ' m sorry ,"" said the other . "" I only point out what seems a reasonable possibility . If you could tell by his manner when the word that might hang him had come , why shouldn ' t he tell from your manner that the word that might hang him was coming ? I should ask for more than words myself before I hanged anybody ."""
chesterton#"Usher smote the table and rose in a sort of angry triumph . "" And that ,"" he cried , "" is just what I ' m going to give you . I tried the machine first just in order to test the thing in other ways afterwards and the machine , sir , is right ."" He paused a moment and resumed with less excitement . "" I rather want to insist , if it comes to that , that so far I had very little to go on except the scientific experiment . There was really nothing against the man at all ."
chesterton#His clothes were ill - fitting , as I ' ve said , but they were rather better , if anything , than those of the submerged class to which he evidently belonged . Moreover , under all the stains of his plunging through ploughed fields or bursting through dusty hedges , the man was comparatively clean . This might mean , of course , that he had only just broken prison ; but it reminded me more of the desperate decency of the comparatively respectable poor . His demeanour was , I am bound to confess , quite in accordance with theirs . He was silent and dignified as they are ; he seemed to have a big , but buried , grievance , as they do . He professed total ignorance of the crime and the whole question ; and showed nothing but a sullen impatience for something sensible that might come to take him out of his meaningless scrape .
chesterton#"He asked me more than once if he could telephone for a lawyer who had helped him a long time ago in a trade dispute , and in every sense acted as you would expect an innocent man to act . There was nothing against him in the world except that little finger on the dial that pointed to the change of his pulse . "" Then , sir , the machine was on its trial ; and the machine was right . By the time I came with him out of the private room into the vestibule where all sorts of other people were awaiting examination , I think he had already more or less made up his mind to clear things up by something like a confession . He turned to me and began to say in a low voice : ` Oh , I can ' t stick this any more . If you must know all about me --'"
chesterton#""" At the same instant one of the poor women sitting on the long bench stood up , screaming aloud and pointing at him with her finger . I have never in my life heard anything more demoniacally distinct . Her lean finger seemed to pick him out as if it were a pea - shooter . Though the word was a mere howl , every syllable was as clear as a separate stroke on the clock . ""` Drugger Davis !' she shouted ."
chesterton#"` They ' ve got Drugger Davis !' "" Among the wretched women , mostly thieves and streetwalkers , twenty faces were turned , gaping with glee and hate . If I had never heard the words , I should have known by the very shock upon his features that the so - called Oscar Rian had heard his real name . But I ' m not quite so ignorant , you may be surprised to hear . Drugger Davis was one of the most terrible and depraved criminals that ever baffled our police . It is certain he had done murder more than once long before his last exploit with the warder ."
chesterton#But he was never entirely fixed for it , curiously enough because he did it in the same manner as those milder -- or meaner -- crimes for which he was fixed pretty often . He was a handsome , well - bred - looking brute , as he still is , to some extent ; and he used mostly to go about with barmaids or shop - girls and do them out of their money . Very often , though , he went a good deal farther ; and they were found drugged with cigarettes or chocolates and their whole property missing . Then came one case where the girl was found dead ; but deliberation could not quite be proved , and , what was more practical still , the criminal could not be found . I heard a rumour of his having reappeared somewhere in the opposite character this time , lending money instead of borrowing it ; but still to such poor widows as he might personally fascinate , but still with the same bad result for them . Well , there is your innocent man , and there is his innocent record .
chesterton#"Even , since then , four criminals and three warders have identified him and confirmed the story . Now what have you got to say to my poor little machine after that ? Hasn ' t the machine done for him ? Or do you prefer to say that the woman and I have done for him ?"" "" As to what you ' ve done for him ,"" replied Father Brown , rising and shaking himself in a floppy way , "" you ' ve saved him from the electrical chair . I don ' t think they can kill Drugger Davis on that old vague story of the poison ; and as for the convict who killed the warder , I suppose it ' s obvious that you haven ' t got him ."
chesterton#"Mr Davis is innocent of that crime , at any rate ."" "" What do you mean ?"" demanded the other . "" Why should he be innocent of that crime ?"" "" Why , bless us all !"" cried the small man in one of his rare moments of animation , "" why , because he ' s guilty of the other crimes !"
chesterton#I don ' t know what you people are made of . You seem to think that all sins are kept together in a bag . You talk as if a miser on Monday were always a spendthrift on Tuesday . You tell me this man you have here spent weeks and months wheedling needy women out of small sums of money ; that he used a drug at the best , and a poison at the worst ; that he turned up afterwards as the lowest kind of moneylender , and cheated most poor people in the same patient and pacific style . Let it be granted -- let us admit , for the sake of argument , that he did all this . If that is so , I will tell you what he didn ' t do .
chesterton#He didn ' t storm a spiked wall against a man with a loaded gun . He didn ' t write on the wall with his own hand , to say he had done it . He didn ' t stop to state that his justification was self - defence . He didn ' t explain that he had no quarrel with the poor warder . He didn ' t name the house of the rich man to which he was going with the gun . He didn ' t write his own , initials in a man ' s blood .
chesterton#"Saints alive ! Can ' t you see the whole character is different , in good and evil ? Why , you don ' t seem to be like I am a bit . One would think you ' d never had any vices of your own ."" The amazed American had already parted his lips in protest when the door of his private and official room was hammered and rattled in an unceremonious way to which he was totally unaccustomed . The door flew open ."
chesterton#The moment before Greywood Usher had been coming to the conclusion that Father Brown might possibly be mad . The moment after he began to think he was mad himself . There burst and fell into his private room a man in the filthiest rags , with a greasy squash hat still askew on his head , and a shabby green shade shoved up from one of his eyes , both of which were glaring like a tiger ' s . The rest of his face was almost undiscoverable , being masked with a matted beard and whiskers through which the nose could barely thrust itself , and further buried in a squalid red scarf or handkerchief . Mr Usher prided himself on having seen most of the roughest specimens in the State , but he thought he had never seen such a baboon dressed as a scarecrow as this . But , above all , he had never in all his placid scientific existence heard a man like that speak to him first .
chesterton#""" See here , old man Usher ,"" shouted the being in the red handkerchief , "" I ' m getting tired . Don ' t you try any of your hide - and - seek on me ; I don ' t get fooled any . Leave go of my guests , and I ' ll let up on the fancy clockwork . Keep him here for a split instant and you ' ll feel pretty mean . I reckon I ' m not a man with no pull ."" The eminent Usher was regarding the bellowing monster with an amazement which had dried up all other sentiments ."
chesterton#"The mere shock to his eyes had rendered his ears , almost useless . At last he rang a bell with a hand of violence . While the bell was still strong and pealing , the voice of Father Brown fell soft but distinct . "" I have a suggestion to make ,"" he said , "" but it seems a little confusing . I don ' t know this gentleman -- but -- but I think I know him . Now , you know him -- you know him quite well -- but you don ' t know him -- naturally ."
chesterton#"Sounds paradoxical , I know ."" "" I reckon the Cosmos is cracked ,"" said Usher , and fell asprawl in his round office chair . "" Now , see here ,"" vociferated the stranger , striking the table , but speaking in a voice that was all the more mysterious because it was comparatively mild and rational though still resounding . "" I won ' t let you in . I want --"" "" Who in hell are you ?"""
chesterton#"yelled Usher , suddenly sitting up straight . "" I think the gentleman ' s name is Todd ,"" said the priest . Then he picked up the pink slip of newspaper . "" I fear you don ' t read the Society papers properly ,"" he said , and began to read out in a monotonous voice , ""` Or locked in the jewelled bosoms of our city ' s gayest leaders ; but there is talk of a pretty parody of the manners and customs of the other end of Society ' s scale .' There ' s been a big Slum Dinner up at Pilgrim ' s Pond tonight ; and a man , one of the guests , disappeared . Mr Ireton Todd is a good host , and has tracked him here , without even waiting to take off his fancy - dress ."""
chesterton#""" What man do you mean ?"" "" I mean the man with comically ill - fitting clothes you saw running across the ploughed field . Hadn ' t you better go and investigate him ? He will be rather impatient to get back to his champagne , from which he ran away in such a hurry , when the convict with the gun hove in sight ."" "" Do you seriously mean --"" began the official . "" Why , look here , Mr Usher ,"" said Father Brown quietly , "" you said the machine couldn ' t make a mistake ; and in one sense it didn ' t ."
chesterton#"But the other machine did ; the machine that worked it . You assumed that the man in rags jumped at the name of Lord Falconroy , because he was Lord Falconroy ' s murderer . He jumped at the name of Lord Falconroy because he is Lord Falconroy ."" "" Then why the blazes didn ' t he say so ?"" demanded the staring Usher . "" He felt his plight and recent panic were hardly patrician ,"" replied the priest , "" so he tried to keep the name back at first ."
chesterton#"But he was just going to tell it you , when ""-- and Father Brown looked down at his boots --"" when a woman found another name for him ."" "" But you can ' t be so mad as to say ,"" said Greywood Usher , very white , "" that Lord Falconroy was Drugger Davis ."" The priest looked at him very earnestly , but with a baffling and undecipherable face . "" I am not saying anything about it ,"" he said . "" I leave all the rest to you . Your pink paper says that the title was recently revived for him ; but those papers are very unreliable ."
chesterton#"It says he was in the States in youth ; but the whole story seems very strange . Davis and Falconroy are both pretty considerable cowards , but so are lots of other men . I would not hang a dog on my own opinion about this . But I think ,"" he went on softly and reflectively , "" I think you Americans are too modest . I think you idealize the English aristocracy -- even in assuming it to be so aristocratic . You see a good - looking Englishman in evening - dress ; you know he ' s in the House of Lords ; and you fancy he has a father ."
chesterton#"You don ' t allow for our national buoyancy and uplift . Many of our most influential noblemen have not only risen recently , but --"" "" Oh , stop it !"" cried Greywood Usher , wringing one lean hand in impatience against a shade of irony in the other ' s face . "" Don ' t stay talking to this lunatic !"" cried Todd brutally ."
chesterton#""" Take me to my friend ."" Next morning Father Brown appeared with the same demure expression , carrying yet another piece of pink newspaper . "" I ' m afraid you neglect the fashionable press rather ,"" he said , "" but this cutting may interest you ."" Usher read the headlines , "" Last - Trick ' s Strayed Revellers : Mirthful Incident near Pilgrim ' s Pond ."" The paragraph went on : "" A laughable occurrence took place outside Wilkinson ' s Motor Garage last night . A policeman on duty had his attention drawn by larrikins to a man in prison dress who was stepping with considerable coolness into the steering - seat of a pretty high - toned Panhard ; he was accompanied by a girl wrapped in a ragged shawl ."
chesterton#"On the police interfering , the young woman threw back the shawl , and all recognized Millionaire Todd ' s daughter , who had just come from the Slum Freak Dinner at the Pond , where all the choicest guests were in a similar deshabille . She and the gentleman who had donned prison uniform were going for the customary joy - ride ."" Under the pink slip Mr Usher found a strip of a later paper , headed , "" Astounding Escape of Millionaire ' s Daughter with Convict . She had Arranged Freak Dinner . Now Safe in --"" Mr Greenwood Usher lifted his eyes , but Father Brown was gone ."
chesterton#VI . The Head of Caesar THERE is somewhere in Brompton or Kensington an interminable avenue of tall houses , rich but largely empty , that looks like a terrace of tombs . The very steps up to the dark front doors seem as steep as the side of pyramids ; one would hesitate to knock at the door , lest it should be opened by a mummy . But a yet more depressing feature in the grey facade is its telescopic length and changeless continuity . The pilgrim walking down it begins to think he will never come to a break or a corner ; but there is one exception -- a very small one , but hailed by the pilgrim almost with a shout .
chesterton#There is a sort of mews between two of the tall mansions , a mere slit like the crack of a door by comparison with the street , but just large enough to permit a pigmy ale - house or eating - house , still allowed by the rich to their stable - servants , to stand in the angle . There is something cheery in its very dinginess , and something free and elfin in its very insignificance . At the feet of those grey stone giants it looks like a lighted house of dwarfs . Anyone passing the place during a certain autumn evening , itself almost fairylike , might have seen a hand pull aside the red half - blind which ( along with some large white lettering ) half hid the interior from the street , and a face peer out not unlike a rather innocent goblin ' s . It was , in fact , the face of one with the harmless human name of Brown , formerly priest of Cobhole in Essex , and now working in London . His friend , Flambeau , a semi - official investigator , was sitting opposite him , making his last notes of a case he had cleared up in the neighbourhood .
chesterton#"They were sitting at a small table , close up to the window , when the priest pulled the curtain back and looked out . He waited till a stranger in the street had passed the window , to let the curtain fall into its place again . Then his round eyes rolled to the large white lettering on the window above his head , and then strayed to the next table , at which sat only a navvy with beer and cheese , and a young girl with red hair and a glass of milk . Then ( seeing his friend put away the pocket - book ), he said softly : "" If you ' ve got ten minutes , I wish you ' d follow that man with the false nose ."" Flambeau looked up in surprise ; but the girl with the red hair also looked up , and with something that was stronger than astonishment ."
chesterton#"She was simply and even loosely dressed in light brown sacking stuff ; but she was a lady , and even , on a second glance , a rather needlessly haughty one . "" The man with the false nose !"" repeated Flambeau . "" Who ' s he ?"" "" I haven ' t a notion ,"" answered Father Brown . "" I want you to find out ; I ask it as a favour ."
chesterton#"He went down there ""-- and he jerked his thumb over his shoulder in one of his undistinguished gestures -- "" and can ' t have passed three lamp - posts yet . I only want to know the direction ."" Flambeau gazed at his friend for some time , with an expression between perplexity and amusement ; and then , rising from the table ; squeezed his huge form out of the little door of the dwarf tavern , and melted into the twilight . Father Brown took a small book out of his pocket and began to read steadily ; he betrayed no consciousness of the fact that the red - haired lady had left her own table and sat down opposite him . At last she leaned over and said in a low , strong voice : "" Why do you say that ? How do you know it ' s false ?"""
chesterton#"He lifted his rather heavy eyelids , which fluttered in considerable embarrassment . Then his dubious eye roamed again to the white lettering on the glass front of the public - house . The young woman ' s eyes followed his , and rested there also , but in pure puzzledom . "" No ,"" said Father Brown , answering her thoughts . "" It doesn ' t say ` Sela ', like the thing in the Psalms ; I read it like that myself when I was wool - gathering just now ; it says ` Ales .'"" "" Well ?"""
chesterton#"inquired the staring young lady . "" What does it matter what it says ?"" His ruminating eye roved to the girl ' s light canvas sleeve , round the wrist of which ran a very slight thread of artistic pattern , just enough to distinguish it from a working - dress of a common woman and make it more like the working - dress of a lady art - student . He seemed to find much food for thought in this ; but his reply was very slow and hesitant . "" You see , madam ,"" he said , "" from outside the place looks -- well , it is a perfectly decent place -- but ladies like you don ' t -- don ' t generally think so . They never go into such places from choice , except --"""
chesterton#""" Well ?"" she repeated . "" Except an unfortunate few who don ' t go in to drink milk ."" "" You are a most singular person ,"" said the young lady . "" What is your object in all this ?"" "" Not to trouble you about it ,"" he replied , very gently ."
chesterton#""" Only to arm myself with knowledge enough to help you , if ever you freely ask my help ."" "" But why should I need help ?"" He continued his dreamy monologue . "" You couldn ' t have come in to see protegees , humble friends , that sort of thing , or you ' d have gone through into the parlour ... and you couldn ' t have come in because you were ill , or you ' d have spoken to the woman of the place , who ' s obviously respectable ... besides , you don ' t look ill in that way , but only unhappy .... This street is the only original long lane that has no turning ; and the houses on both sides are shut up .... I could only suppose that you ' d seen somebody coming whom you didn ' t want to meet ; and found the public - house was the only shelter in this wilderness of stone ...."
chesterton#"I don ' t think I went beyond the licence of a stranger in glancing at the only man who passed immediately after .... And as I thought he looked like the wrong sort ... and you looked like the right sort .... I held myself ready to help if he annoyed you ; that is all . As for my friend , he ' ll be back soon ; and he certainly can ' t find out anything by stumping down a road like this .... I didn ' t think he could ."" "" Then why did you send him out ?"" she cried , leaning forward with yet warmer curiosity ."
chesterton#"She had the proud , impetuous face that goes with reddish colouring , and a Roman nose , as it did in Marie Antoinette . He looked at her steadily for the first time , and said : "" Because I hoped you would speak to me ."" She looked back at him for some time with a heated face , in which there hung a red shadow of anger ; then , despite her anxieties , humour broke out of her eyes and the corners of her mouth , and she answered almost grimly : "" Well , if you ' re so keen on my conversation , perhaps you ' ll answer my question ."" After a pause she added : "" I had the honour to ask you why you thought the man ' s nose was false ."" "" The wax always spots like that just a little in this weather ,"" answered Father Brown with entire simplicity , "" But it ' s such a crooked nose ,"" remonstrated the red - haired girl ."
chesterton#"The priest smiled in his turn . "" I don ' t say it ' s the sort of nose one would wear out of mere foppery ,"" he admitted . "" This man , I think , wears it because his real nose is so much nicer ."" "" But why ?"" she insisted . "" What is the nursery - rhyme ?"""
chesterton#"observed Brown absent - mindedly . "" There was a crooked man and he went a crooked mile .... That man , I fancy , has gone a very crooked road -- by following his nose ."" "" Why , what ' s he done ?"" she demanded , rather shakily . "" I don ' t want to force your confidence by a hair ,"" said Father Brown , very quietly . "" But I think you could tell me more about that than I can tell you ."""
chesterton#"The girl sprang to her feet and stood quite quietly , but with clenched hands , like one about to stride away ; then her hands loosened slowly , and she sat down again . "" You are more of a mystery than all the others ,"" she said desperately , "" but I feel there might be a heart in your mystery ."" "" What we all dread most ,"" said the priest in a low voice , "" is a maze with no centre . That is why atheism is only a nightmare ."" "" I will tell you everything ,"" said the red - haired girl doggedly , "" except why I am telling you ; and that I don ' t know ."" She picked at the darned table - cloth and went on : "" You look as if you knew what isn ' t snobbery as well as what is ; and when I say that ours is a good old family , you ' ll understand it is a necessary part of the story ; indeed , my chief danger is in my brother ' s high - and - dry notions , noblesse oblige and all that ."
chesterton#Well , my name is Christabel Carstairs ; and my father was that Colonel Carstairs you ' ve probably heard of , who made the famous Carstairs Collection of Roman coins . I could never describe my father to you ; the nearest I can say is that he was very like a Roman coin himself . He was as handsome and as genuine and as valuable and as metallic and as out - of - date . He was prouder of his Collection than of his coat - of - arms -- nobody could say more than that . His extraordinary character came out most in his will . He had two sons and one daughter .
chesterton#"He quarrelled with one son , my brother Giles , and sent him to Australia on a small allowance . He then made a will leaving the Carstairs Collection , actually with a yet smaller allowance , to my brother Arthur . He meant it as a reward , as the highest honour he could offer , in acknowledgement of Arthur ' s loyalty and rectitude and the distinctions he had already gained in mathematics and economics at Cambridge . He left me practically all his pretty large fortune ; and I am sure he meant it in contempt . "" Arthur , you may say , might well complain of this ; but Arthur is my father over again . Though he had some differences with my father in early youth , no sooner had he taken over the Collection than he became like a pagan priest dedicated to a temple ."
chesterton#He mixed up these Roman halfpence with the honour of the Carstairs family in the same stiff , idolatrous way as his father before him . He acted as if Roman money must be guarded by all the Roman virtues . He took no pleasures ; he spent nothing on himself ; he lived for the Collection . Often he would not trouble to dress for his simple meals ; but pattered about among the corded brown - paper parcels ( which no one else was allowed to touch ) in an old brown dressing - gown . With its rope and tassel and his pale , thin , refined face , it made him look like an old ascetic monk . Every now and then , though , he would appear dressed like a decidedly fashionable gentleman ; but that was only when he went up to the London sales or shops to make an addition to the Carstairs Collection .
chesterton#""" Now , if you ' ve known any young people , you won ' t be shocked if I say that I got into rather a low frame of mind with all this ; the frame of mind in which one begins to say that the Ancient Romans were all very well in their way . I ' m not like my brother Arthur ; I can ' t help enjoying enjoyment . I got a lot of romance and rubbish where I got my red hair , from the other side of the family . Poor Giles was the same ; and I think the atmosphere of coins might count in excuse for him ; though he really did wrong and nearly went to prison . But he didn ' t behave any worse than I did ; as you shall hear . "" I come now to the silly part of the story ."
chesterton#I think a man as clever as you can guess the sort of thing that would begin to relieve the monotony for an unruly girl of seventeen placed in such a position . But I am so rattled with more dreadful things that I can hardly read my own feeling ; and don ' t know whether I despise it now as a flirtation or bear it as a broken heart . We lived then at a little seaside watering - place in South Wales , and a retired sea - captain living a few doors off had a son about five years older than myself , who had been a friend of Giles before he went to the Colonies . His name does not affect my tale ; but I tell you it was Philip Hawker , because I am telling you everything . We used to go shrimping together , and said and thought we were in love with each other ; at least he certainly said he was , and I certainly thought I was . If I tell you he had bronzed curly hair and a falconish sort of face , bronzed by the sea also , it ' s not for his sake , I assure you , but for the story ; for it was the cause of a very curious coincidence .
chesterton#""" One summer afternoon , when I had promised to go shrimping along the sands with Philip , I was waiting rather impatiently in the front drawing - room , watching Arthur handle some packets of coins he had just purchased and slowly shunt them , one or two at a time , into his own dark study and museum which was at the back of the house . As soon as I heard the heavy door close on him finally , I made a bolt for my shrimping - net and tam - o '- shanter and was just going to slip out , when I saw that my brother had left behind him one coin that lay gleaming on the long bench by the window . It was a bronze coin , and the colour , combined with the exact curve of the Roman nose and something in the very lift of the long , wiry neck , made the head of Caesar on it the almost precise portrait of Philip Hawker . Then I suddenly remembered Giles telling Philip of a coin that was like him , and Philip wishing he had it . Perhaps you can fancy the wild , foolish thoughts with which my head went round ; I felt as if I had had a gift from the fairies . It seemed to me that if I could only run away with this , and give it to Philip like a wild sort of wedding - ring , it would be a bond between us for ever ; I felt a thousand such things at once ."
chesterton#Then there yawned under me , like the pit , the enormous , awful notion of what I was doing ; above all , the unbearable thought , which was like touching hot iron , of what Arthur would think of it . A Carstairs a thief ; and a thief of the Carstairs treasure ! I believe my brother could see me burned like a witch for such a thing , But then , the very thought of such fanatical cruelty heightened my old hatred of his dingy old antiquarian fussiness and my longing for the youth and liberty that called to me from the sea . Outside was strong sunlight with a wind ; and a yellow head of some broom or gorse in the garden rapped against the glass of the window . I thought of that living and growing gold calling to me from all the heaths of the world -- and then of that dead , dull gold and bronze and brass of my brother ' s growing dustier and dustier as life went by . Nature and the Carstairs Collection had come to grips at last .
chesterton#""" Nature is older than the Carstairs Collection . As I ran down the streets to the sea , the coin clenched tight in my fist , I felt all the Roman Empire on my back as well as the Carstairs pedigree . It was not only the old lion argent that was roaring in my ear , but all the eagles of the Caesars seemed flapping and screaming in pursuit of me . And yet my heart rose higher and higher like a child ' s kite , until I came over the loose , dry sand - hills and to the flat , wet sands , where Philip stood already up to his ankles in the shallow shining water , some hundred yards out to sea . There was a great red sunset ; and the long stretch of low water , hardly rising over the ankle for half a mile , was like a lake of ruby flame . It was not till I had torn off my shoes and stockings and waded to where he stood , which was well away from the dry land , that I turned and looked round ."
chesterton#"We were quite alone in a circle of sea - water and wet sand , and I gave him the head of Caesar . "" At the very instant I had a shock of fancy : that a man far away on the sand - hills was looking at me intently . I must have felt immediately after that it was a mere leap of unreasonable nerves ; for the man was only a dark dot in the distance , and I could only just see that he was standing quite still and gazing , with his head a little on one side . There was no earthly logical evidence that he was looking at me ; he might have been looking at a ship , or the sunset , or the sea - gulls , or at any of the people who still strayed here and there on the shore between us . Nevertheless , whatever my start sprang from was prophetic ; for , as I gazed , he started walking briskly in a bee - line towards us across the wide wet sands . As he drew nearer and nearer I saw that he was dark and bearded , and that his eyes were marked with dark spectacles ."
chesterton#"He was dressed poorly but respectably in black , from the old black top hat on his head to the solid black boots on his feet . In spite of these he walked straight into the sea without a flash of hesitation , and came on at me with the steadiness of a travelling bullet . "" I can ' t tell you the sense of monstrosity and miracle I had when he thus silently burst the barrier between land and water . It was as if he had walked straight off a cliff and still marched steadily in mid - air . It was as if a house had flown up into the sky or a man ' s head had fallen off . He was only wetting his boots ; but he seemed to be a demon disregarding a law of Nature ."
chesterton#"If he had hesitated an instant at the water ' s edge it would have been nothing . As it was , he seemed to look so much at me alone as not to notice the ocean . Philip was some yards away with his back to me , bending over his net . The stranger came on till he stood within two yards of me , the water washing half - way up to his knees . Then he said , with a clearly modulated and rather mincing articulation : ` Would it discommode you to contribute elsewhere a coin with a somewhat different superscription ?' "" With one exception there was nothing definably abnormal about him ."
chesterton#His tinted glasses were not really opaque , but of a blue kind common enough , nor were the eyes behind them shifty , but regarded me steadily . His dark beard was not really long or wild --, but he looked rather hairy , because the beard began very high up in his face , just under the cheek - bones . His complexion was neither sallow nor livid , but on the contrary rather clear and youthful ; yet this gave a pink - and - white wax look which somehow ( I don ' t know why ) rather increased the horror . The only oddity one could fix was that his nose , which was otherwise of a good shape , was just slightly turned sideways at the tip ; as if , when it was soft , it had been tapped on one side with a toy hammer . The thing was hardly a deformity ; yet I cannot tell you what a living nightmare it was to me . As he stood there in the sunset - stained water he affected me as some hellish sea - monster just risen roaring out of a sea like blood .
chesterton#"I don ' t know why a touch on the nose should affect my imagination so much . I think it seemed as if he could move his nose like a finger . And as if he had just that moment moved it . ""` Any little assistance ,' he continued with the same queer , priggish accent , ` that may obviate the necessity of my communicating with the family .' "" Then it rushed over me that I was being blackmailed for the theft of the bronze piece ; and all my merely superstitious fears and doubts were swallowed up in one overpowering , practical question . How could he have found out ?"
chesterton#"I had stolen the thing suddenly and on impulse ; I was certainly alone ; for I always made sure of being unobserved when I slipped out to see Philip in this way . I had not , to all appearance , been followed in the street ; and if I had , they could not ` X - ray ' the coin in my closed hand . The man standing on the sand - hills could no more have seen what I gave Philip than shoot a fly in one eye , like the man in the fairy - tale . ""` Philip ,' I cried helplessly , ` ask this man what he wants .' "" When Philip lifted his head at last from mending his net he looked rather red , as if sulky or ashamed ; but it may have been only the exertion of stooping and the red evening light ; I may have only had another of the morbid fancies that seemed to be dancing about me . He merely said gruffly to the man : ` You clear out of this .'"
chesterton#And , motioning me to follow , set off wading shoreward without paying further attention to him . He stepped on to a stone breakwater that ran out from among the roots of the sand - hills , and so struck homeward , perhaps thinking our incubus would find it less easy to walk on such rough stones , green and slippery with seaweed , than we , who were young and used to it . But my persecutor walked as daintily as he talked ; and he still followed me , picking his way and picking his phrases . I heard his delicate , detestable voice appealing to me over my shoulder , until at last , when we had crested the sand - hills , Philip ' s patience ( which was by no means so conspicuous on most occasions ) seemed to snap . He turned suddenly , saying , ` Go back . I can ' t talk to you now .'
chesterton#"And as the man hovered and opened his mouth , Philip struck him a buffet on it that sent him flying from the top of the tallest sand - hill to the bottom . I saw him crawling out below , covered with sand . "" This stroke comforted me somehow , though it might well increase my peril ; but Philip showed none of his usual elation at his own prowess . Though as affectionate as ever , he still seemed cast down ; and before I could ask him anything fully , he parted with me at his own gate , with two remarks that struck me as strange . He said that , all things considered , I ought to put the coin back in the Collection ; but that he himself would keep it ` for the present '. And then he added quite suddenly and irrelevantly :, ` You know Giles is back from Australia ?'"""
chesterton#"The door of the tavern opened and the gigantic shadow of the investigator Flambeau fell across the table . Father Brown presented him to the lady in his own slight , persuasive style of speech , mentioning his knowledge and sympathy in such cases ; and almost without knowing , the girl was soon reiterating her story to two listeners . But Flambeau , as he bowed and sat down , handed the priest a small slip of paper . Brown accepted it with some surprise and read on it : "" Cab to Wagga Wagga , 379 , Mafeking Avenue , Putney ."" The girl was going on with her story . "" I went up the steep street to my own house with my head in a whirl ; it had not begun to clear when I came to the doorstep , on which I found a milk - can -- and the man with the twisted nose ."
chesterton#"The milk - can told me the servants were all out ; for , of course , Arthur , browsing about in his brown dressing - gown in a brown study , would not hear or answer a bell . Thus there was no one to help me in the house , except my brother , whose help must be my ruin . In desperation I thrust two shillings into the horrid thing ' s hand , and told him to call again in a few days , when I had thought it out . He went off sulking , but more sheepishly than I had expected -- perhaps he had been shaken by his fall -- and I watched the star of sand splashed on his back receding down the road with a horrid vindictive pleasure . He turned a corner some six houses down . "" Then I let myself in , made myself some tea , and tried to think it out ."
chesterton#"I sat at the drawing - room window looking on to the garden , which still glowed with the last full evening light . But I was too distracted and dreamy to look at the lawns and flower - pots and flower - beds with any concentration . So I took the shock the more sharply because I ' d seen it so slowly . "" The man or monster I ' d sent away was standing quite still in the middle of the garden . Oh , we ' ve all read a lot about pale - faced phantoms in the dark ; but this was more dreadful than anything of that kind could ever be . Because , though he cast a long evening shadow , he still stood in warm sunlight ."
chesterton#"And because his face was not pale , but had that waxen bloom still upon it that belongs to a barber ' s dummy . He stood quite still , with his face towards me ; and I can ' t tell you how horrid he looked among the tulips and all those tall , gaudy , almost hothouse - looking flowers . It looked as if we ' d stuck up a waxwork instead of a statue in the centre of our garden . "" Yet almost the instant he saw me move in the window he turned and ran out of the garden by the back gate , which stood open and by which he had undoubtedly entered . This renewed timidity on his part was so different from the impudence with which he had walked into the sea , that I felt vaguely comforted . I fancied , perhaps , that he feared confronting Arthur more than I knew ."
chesterton#"Anyhow , I settled down at last , and had a quiet dinner alone ( for it was against the rules to disturb Arthur when he was rearranging the museum ), and , my thoughts , a little released , fled to Philip and lost themselves , I suppose . Anyhow , I was looking blankly , but rather pleasantly than otherwise , at another window , uncurtained , but by this time black as a slate with the final night - fall . It seemed to me that something like a snail was on the outside of the window - pane . But when I stared harder , it was more like a man ' s thumb pressed on the pane ; it had that curled look that a thumb has . With my fear and courage re - awakened together , I rushed at the window and then recoiled with a strangled scream that any man but Arthur must have heard . "" For it was not a thumb , any more than it was a snail ."
chesterton#"It was the tip of a crooked nose , crushed against the glass ; it looked white with the pressure ; and the staring face and eyes behind it were at first invisible and afterwards grey like a ghost . I slammed the shutters together somehow , rushed up to my room and locked myself in . But , even as I passed , I could swear I saw a second black window with something on it that was like a snail . "" It might be best to go to Arthur after all . If the thing was crawling close all around the house like a cat , it might have purposes worse even than blackmail . My brother might cast me out and curse me for ever , but he was a gentleman , and would defend me on the spot ."
chesterton#"After ten minutes ' curious thinking , I went down , knocked on the door and then went in : to see the last and worst sight . "" My brother ' s chair was empty , and he was obviously out . But the man with the crooked nose was sitting waiting for his return , with his hat still insolently on his head , and actually reading one of my brother ' s books under my brother ' s lamp . His face was composed and occupied , but his nose - tip still had the air of being the most mobile part of his face , as if it had just turned from left to right like an elephant ' s proboscis . I had thought him poisonous enough while he was pursuing and watching me ; but I think his unconsciousness of my presence was more frightful still . "" I think I screamed loud and long ; but that doesn ' t matter ."
chesterton#What I did next does matter : I gave him all the money I had , including a good deal in paper which , though it was mine , I dare say I had no right to touch . He went off at last , with hateful , tactful regrets all in long words ; and I sat down , feeling ruined in every sense . And yet I was saved that very night by a pure accident . Arthur had gone off suddenly to London , as he so often did , for bargains ; and returned , late but radiant , having nearly secured a treasure that was an added splendour even to the family Collection . He was so resplendent that I was almost emboldened to confess the abstraction of the lesser gem --, but he bore down all other topics with his over - powering projects . Because the bargain might still misfire any moment , he insisted on my packing at once and going up with him to lodgings he had already taken in Fulham , to be near the curio - shop in question .
chesterton#"Thus in spite of myself , I fled from my foe almost in the dead of night -- but from Philip also .... My brother was often at the South Kensington Museum , and , in order to make some sort of secondary life for myself , I paid for a few lessons at the Art Schools . I was coming back from them this evening , when I saw the abomination of desolation walking alive down the long straight street and the rest is as this gentleman has said . "" I ' ve got only one thing to say . I don ' t deserve to be helped ; and I don ' t question or complain of my punishment ; it is just , it ought to have happened . But I still question , with bursting brains , how it can have happened . Am I punished by miracle ?"
chesterton#"or how can anyone but Philip and myself know I gave him a tiny coin in the middle of the sea ?"" "" It is an extraordinary problem ,"" admitted Flambeau . "" Not so extraordinary as the answer ,"" remarked Father Brown rather gloomily . "" Miss Carstairs , will you be at home if we call at your Fulham place in an hour and a half hence ?"" The girl looked at him , and then rose and put her gloves on . "" Yes ,"" she said , "" I ' ll be there ""; and almost instantly left the place ."
chesterton#"That night the detective and the priest were still talking of the matter as they drew near the Fulham house , a tenement strangely mean even for a temporary residence of the Carstairs family . "" Of course the superficial , on reflection ,"" said Flambeau , "" would think first of this Australian brother who ' s been in trouble before , who ' s come back so suddenly and who ' s just the man to have shabby confederates . But I can ' t see how he can come into the thing by any process of thought , unless ..."" "" Well ?"" asked his companion patiently . Flambeau lowered his voice ."
chesterton#""" Unless the girl ' s lover comes in , too , and he would be the blacker villain . The Australian chap did know that Hawker wanted the coin . But I can ' t see how on earth he could know that Hawker had got it , unless Hawker signalled to him or his representative across the shore ."" "" That is true ,"" assented the priest , with respect . "" Have you noted another thing ?"" went on Flambeau eagerly ."
chesterton#""" this Hawker hears his love insulted , but doesn ' t strike till he ' s got to the soft sand - hills , where he can be victor in a mere sham - fight . If he ' d struck amid rocks and sea , he might have hurt his ally ."" "" That is true again ,"" said Father Brown , nodding . "" And now , take it from the start . It lies between few people , but at least three . You want one person for suicide ; two people for murder ; but at least three people for blackmail """
chesterton#""" Why ?"" asked the priest softly . "" Well , obviously ,"" cried his friend , "" there must be one to be exposed ; one to threaten exposure ; and one at least whom exposure would horrify ."" After a long ruminant pause , the priest said : "" You miss a logical step . Three persons are needed as ideas . Only two are needed as agents ."""
chesterton#""" What can you mean ?"" asked the other . "" Why shouldn ' t a blackmailer ,"" asked Brown , in a low voice , "" threaten his victim with himself ? Suppose a wife became a rigid teetotaller in order to frighten her husband into concealing his pub - frequenting , and then wrote him blackmailing letters in another hand , threatening to tell his wife ! Why shouldn ' t it work ? Suppose a father forbade a son to gamble and then , following him in a good disguise , threatened the boy with his own sham paternal strictness !"
chesterton#"Suppose -- but , here we are , my friend ."" "" My God !"" cried Flambeau ; "" you don ' t mean --"" An active figure ran down the steps of the house and showed under the golden lamplight the unmistakable head that resembled the Roman coin . "" Miss Carstairs ,"" said Hawker without ceremony , "" wouldn ' t go in till you came ."" "" Well ,"" observed Brown confidently , "" don ' t you think it ' s the best thing she can do to stop outside -- with you to look after her ?"
chesterton#"You see , I rather guess you have guessed it all yourself ."" "" Yes ,"" said the young man , in an undertone , "" I guessed on the sands and now I know ; that was why I let him fall soft ."" Taking a latchkey from the girl and the coin from Hawker , Flambeau let himself and his friend into the empty house and passed into the outer parlour . It was empty of all occupants but one . The man whom Father Brown had seen pass the tavern was standing against the wall as if at bay ; unchanged , save that he had taken off his black coat and was wearing a brown dressing - gown . "" We have come ,"" said Father Brown politely , "" to give back this coin to its owner ."""
chesterton#"And he handed it to the man with the nose . Flambeau ' s eyes rolled . "" Is this man a coin - collector ?"" he asked . "" This man is Mr Arthur Carstairs ,"" said the priest positively , "" and he is a coin - collector of a somewhat singular kind ."" The man changed colour so horribly that the crooked nose stood out on his face like a separate and comic thing ."
chesterton#"He spoke , nevertheless , with a sort of despairing dignity . "" You shall see , then ,"" he said , "" that I have not lost all the family qualities ."" And he turned suddenly and strode into an inner room , slamming the door . "" Stop him !"" shouted Father Brown , bounding and half falling over a chair ; and , after a wrench or two , Flambeau had the door open . But it was too late ."
chesterton#"In dead silence Flambeau strode across and telephoned for doctor and police . An empty medicine bottle lay on the floor . Across the table the body of the man in the brown dressing - gown lay amid his burst and gaping brown - paper parcels ; out of which poured and rolled , not Roman , but very modern English coins . The priest held up the bronze head of Caesar . "" This ,"" he said , "" was all that was left of the Carstairs Collection ."" After a silence he went on , with more than common gentleness : "" It was a cruel will his wicked father made , and you see he did resent it a little ."
chesterton#"He hated the Roman money he had , and grew fonder of the real money denied him . He not only sold the Collection bit by bit , but sank bit by bit to the basest ways of making money -- even to blackmailing his own family in a disguise . He blackmailed his brother from Australia for his little forgotten crime ( that is why he took the cab to Wagga Wagga in Putney ), he blackmailed his sister for the theft he alone could have noticed . And that , by the way , is why she had that supernatural guess when he was away on the sand - dunes . Mere figure and gait , however distant , are more likely to remind us of somebody than a well - made - up face quite close ."" There was another silence ."
chesterton#""" Well ,"" growled the detective , "" and so this great numismatist and coin - collector was nothing but a vulgar miser ."" "" Is there so great a difference ?"" asked Father Brown , in the same strange , indulgent tone . "" What is there wrong about a miser that is not often as wrong about a collector ? What is wrong , except ... thou shalt not make to thyself any graven image ; thou shalt not bow down to them nor serve them , for I ... but we must go and see how the poor young people are getting on ."" "" I think ,"" said Flambeau , "" that in spite of everything , they are probably getting on very well ."""
chesterton#VII . The Purple Wig MR EDWARD NUTT , the industrious editor of the Daily Reformer , sat at his desk , opening letters and marking proofs to the merry tune of a typewriter , worked by a vigorous young lady . He was a stoutish , fair man , in his shirt - sleeves ; his movements were resolute , his mouth firm and his tones final ; but his round , rather babyish blue eyes had a bewildered and even wistful look that rather contradicted all this . Nor indeed was the expression altogether misleading . It might truly be said of him , as for many journalists in authority , that his most familiar emotion was one of continuous fear ; fear of libel actions , fear of lost advertisements , fear of misprints , fear of the sack .
chesterton#"His life was a series of distracted compromises between the proprietor of the paper ( and of him ), who was a senile soap - boiler with three ineradicable mistakes in his mind , and the very able staff he had collected to run the paper ; some of whom were brilliant and experienced men and ( what was even worse ) sincere enthusiasts for the political policy of the paper . A letter from one of these lay immediately before him , and rapid and resolute as he was , he seemed almost to hesitate before opening it . He took up a strip of proof instead , ran down it with a blue eye , and a blue pencil , altered the word "" adultery "" to the word "" impropriety ,"" and the word "" Jew "" to the word "" Alien ,"" rang a bell and sent it flying upstairs . Then , with a more thoughtful eye , he ripped open the letter from his more distinguished contributor , which bore a postmark of Devonshire , and read as follows : DEAR NUTT ,-- As I see you ' re working Spooks and Dooks at the same time , what about an article on that rum business of the Eyres of Exmoor ; or as the old women call it down here , the Devil ' s Ear of Eyre ? The head of the family , you know , is the Duke of Exmoor ; he is one of the few really stiff old Tory aristocrats left , a sound old crusted tyrant it is quite in our line to make trouble about ."
chesterton#And I think I ' m on the track of a story that will make trouble . Of course I don ' t believe in the old legend about James I ; and as for you , you don ' t believe in anything , not even in journalism . The legend , you ' ll probably remember , was about the blackest business in English history -- the poisoning of Overbury by that witch ' s cat Frances Howard , and the quite mysterious terror which forced the King to pardon the murderers . There was a lot of alleged witchcraft mixed up with it ; and the story goes that a man - servant listening at the keyhole heard the truth in a talk between the King and Carr ; and the bodily ear with which he heard grew large and monstrous as by magic , so awful was the secret . And though he had to be loaded with lands and gold and made an ancestor of dukes , the elf - shaped ear is still recurrent in the family . Well , you don ' t believe in black magic ; and if you did , you couldn ' t use it for copy .
chesterton#If a miracle happened in your office , you ' d have to hush it up , now so many bishops are agnostics . But that is not the point The point is that there really is something queer about Exmoor and his family ; something quite natural , I dare say , but quite abnormal . And the Ear is in it somehow , I fancy ; either a symbol or a delusion or disease or something . Another tradition says that Cavaliers just after James I began to wear their hair long only to cover the ear of the first Lord Exmoor . This also is no doubt fanciful . The reason I point it out to you is this : It seems to me that we make a mistake in attacking aristocracy entirely for its champagne and diamonds .
chesterton#"Most men rather admire the nobs for having a good time , but I think we surrender too much when we admit that aristocracy has made even the aristocrats happy . I suggest a series of articles pointing out how dreary , how inhuman , how downright diabolist , is the very smell and atmosphere of some of these great houses . There are plenty of instances ; but you couldn ' t begin with a better one than the Ear of the Eyres . By the end of the week I think I can get you the truth about it .-- Yours ever , FRANCIS FINN . Mr Nutt reflected a moment , staring at his left boot ; then he called out in a strong , loud and entirely lifeless voice , in which every syllable sounded alike : "" Miss Barlow , take down a letter to Mr Finn , please ."" DEAR FINN ,-- I think it would do ; copy should reach us second post Saturday .-- Yours , E . NUTT ."
chesterton#"This elaborate epistle he articulated as if it were all one word ; and Miss Barlow rattled it down as if it were all one word . Then he took up another strip of proof and a blue pencil , and altered the word "" supernatural "" to the word "" marvellous "", and the expression "" shoot down "" to the expression "" repress "". In such happy , healthful activities did Mr Nutt disport himself , until the ensuing Saturday found him at the same desk , dictating to the same typist , and using the same blue pencil on the first instalment of Mr Finn ' s revelations . The opening was a sound piece of slashing invective about the evil secrets of princes , and despair in the high places of the earth . Though written violently , it was in excellent English ; but the editor , as usual , had given to somebody else the task of breaking it up into sub - headings , which were of a spicier sort , as "" Peeress and Poisons "", and "" The Eerie Ear "", "" The Eyres in their Eyrie "", and so on through a hundred happy changes . Then followed the legend of the Ear , amplified from Finn ' s first letter , and then the substance of his later discoveries , as follows :"
chesterton#"I know it is the practice of journalists to put the end of the story at the beginning and call it a headline . I know that journalism largely consists in saying "" Lord Jones Dead "" to people who never knew that Lord Jones was alive . Your present correspondent thinks that this , like many other journalistic customs , is bad journalism ; and that the Daily Reformer has to set a better example in such things . He proposes to tell his story as it occurred , step by step . He will use the real names of the parties , who in most cases are ready to confirm his testimony . As for the headlines , the sensational proclamations -- they will come at the end ."
chesterton#I was walking along a public path that threads through a private Devonshire orchard and seems to point towards Devonshire cider , when I came suddenly upon just such a place as the path suggested . It was a long , low inn , consisting really of a cottage and two barns ; thatched all over with the thatch that looks like brown and grey hair grown before history . But outside the door was a sign which called it the Blue Dragon ; and under the sign was one of those long rustic tables that used to stand outside most of the free English inns , before teetotallers and brewers between them destroyed freedom . And at this table sat three gentlemen , who might have lived a hundred years ago . Now that I know them all better , there is no difficulty about disentangling the impressions ; but just then they looked like three very solid ghosts . The dominant figure , both because he was bigger in all three dimensions , and because he sat centrally in the length of the table , facing me , was a tall , fat man dressed completely in black , with a rubicund , even apoplectic visage , but a rather bald and rather bothered brow .
chesterton#Looking at him again , more strictly , I could not exactly say what it was that gave me the sense of antiquity , except the antique cut of his white clerical necktie and the barred wrinkles across his brow . It was even less easy to fix the impression in the case of the man at the right end of the table , who , to say truth , was as commonplace a person as could be seen anywhere , with a round , brown - haired head and a round snub nose , but also clad in clerical black , of a stricter cut . It was only when I saw his broad curved hat lying on the table beside him that I realized why I connected him with anything ancient . He was a Roman Catholic priest . Perhaps the third man , at the other end of the table , had really more to do with it than the rest , though he was both slighter in physical presence and more inconsiderate in his dress . His lank limbs were clad , I might also say clutched , in very tight grey sleeves and pantaloons ; he had a long , sallow , aquiline face which seemed somehow all the more saturnine because his lantern jaws were imprisoned in his collar and neck - cloth more in the style of the old stock ; and his hair ( which ought to have been dark brown ) was of an odd dim , russet colour which , in conjunction with his yellow face , looked rather purple than red .
chesterton#The unobtrusive yet unusual colour was all the more notable because his hair was almost unnaturally healthy and curling , and he wore it full . But , after all analysis , I incline to think that what gave me my first old - fashioned impression was simply a set of tall , old - fashioned wine - glasses , one or two lemons and two churchwarden pipes . And also , perhaps , the old - world errand on which I had come . Being a hardened reporter , and it being apparently a public inn , I did not need to summon much of my impudence to sit down at the long table and order some cider . The big man in black seemed very learned , especially about local antiquities ; the small man in black , though he talked much less , surprised me with a yet wider culture . So we got on very well together ; but the third man , the old gentleman in the tight pantaloons , seemed rather distant and haughty , until I slid into the subject of the Duke of Exmoor and his ancestry .
chesterton#I thought the subject seemed to embarrass the other two a little ; but it broke the spell of the third man ' s silence most successfully . Speaking with restraint and with the accent of a highly educated gentleman , and puffing at intervals at his long churchwarden pipe , he proceeded to tell me some of the most horrible stories I have ever heard in my life : how one of the Eyres in the former ages had hanged his own father ; and another had his wife scourged at the cart tail through the village ; and another had set fire to a church full of children , and so on . Some of the tales , indeed , are not fit for public print --, such as the story of the Scarlet Nuns , the abominable story of the Spotted Dog , or the thing that was done in the quarry . And all this red roll of impieties came from his thin , genteel lips rather primly than otherwise , as he sat sipping the wine out of his tall , thin glass . I could see that the big man opposite me was trying , if anything , to stop him ; but he evidently held the old gentleman in considerable respect , and could not venture to do so at all abruptly . And the little priest at the other end of the - table , though free from any such air of embarrassment , looked steadily at the table , and seemed to listen to the recital with great pain -- as well as he might .
chesterton#""" You don ' t seem ,"" I said to the narrator , "" to be very fond of the Exmoor pedigree ."" He looked at me a moment , his lips still prim , but whitening and tightening ; then he deliberately broke his long pipe and glass on the table and stood up , the very picture of a perfect gentleman with the framing temper of a fiend . "" These gentlemen ,"" he said , "" will tell you whether I have cause to like it . The curse of the Eyres of old has lain heavy on this country , and many have suffered from it . They know there are none who have suffered from it as I have ."" And with that he crushed a piece of the fallen glass under his heel , and strode away among the green twilight of the twinkling apple - trees ."
chesterton#""" That is an extraordinary old gentleman ,"" I said to the other two ; "" do you happen to know what the Exmoor family has done to him ? Who is he ?"" The big man in black was staring at me with the wild air of a baffled bull ; he did not at first seem to take it in . Then he said at last , "" Don ' t you know who he is ?"" I reaffirmed my ignorance , and there was another silence ; then the little priest said , still looking at the table , "" That is the Duke of Exmoor ."" Then , before I could collect my scattered senses , he added equally quietly , but with an air of regularizing things : "" My friend here is Doctor Mull , the Duke ' s librarian ."
chesterton#"My name is Brown ."" "" But ,"" I stammered , "" if that is the Duke , why does he damn all the old dukes like that ?"" "" He seems really to believe ,"" answered the priest called Brown , "" that they have left a curse on him ."" Then he added , with some irrelevance , "" That ' s why he wears a wig ."" It was a few moments before his meaning dawned on me . "" You don ' t mean that fable about the fantastic ear ?"""
chesterton#"I demanded . "" I ' ve heard of it , of course , but surely it must be a superstitious yarn spun out of something much simpler . I ' ve sometimes thought it was a wild version of one of those mutilation stories . They used to crop criminals ' ears in the sixteenth century ."" "" I hardly think it was that ,"" answered the little man thoughtfully , "" but it is not outside ordinary science or natural law for a family to have some deformity frequently reappearing -- such as one ear bigger than the other ."" The big librarian had buried his big bald brow in his big red hands , like a man trying to think out his duty ."
chesterton#""" No ,"" he groaned . "" You do the man a wrong after all . Understand , I ' ve no reason to defend him , or even keep faith with him . He has been a tyrant to me as to everybody else . Don ' t fancy because you see him sitting here that he isn ' t a great lord in the worst sense of the word . He would fetch a man a mile to ring a bell a yard off -- if it would summon another man three miles to fetch a matchbox three yards off ."
chesterton#"He must have a footman to carry his walking - stick ; a body servant to hold up his opera - glasses --"" "" But not a valet to brush his clothes ,"" cut in the priest , with a curious dryness , "" for the valet would want to brush his wig , too ."" The librarian turned to him and seemed to forget my presence ; he was strongly moved and , I think , a little heated with wine . "" I don ' t know how you know it , Father Brown ,"" he said , "" but you are right . He lets the whole world do everything for him -- except dress him . And that he insists on doing in a literal solitude like a desert ."
chesterton#"Anybody is kicked out of the house without a character who is so much as found near his dressing - room door ., "" He seems a pleasant old party ,"" I remarked . "" No ,"" replied Dr Mull quite simply ; "" and yet that is just what I mean by saying you are unjust to him after all . Gentlemen , the Duke does really feel the bitterness about the curse that he uttered just now . He does , with sincere shame and terror , hide under that purple wig something he thinks it would blast the sons of man to see . I know it is so ; and I know it is not a mere natural disfigurement , like a criminal mutilation , or a hereditary disproportion in the features ."
chesterton#"I know it is worse than that ; because a man told me who was present at a scene that no man could invent , where a stronger man than any of us tried to defy the secret , and was scared away from it ."" I opened my mouth to speak , but Mull went on in oblivion of me , speaking out of the cavern of his hands . "" I don ' t mind telling you , Father , because it ' s really more defending the poor Duke than giving him away . Didn ' t you ever hear of the time when he very nearly lost all the estates ?"" The priest shook his head ; and the librarian proceeded to tell the tale as he had heard it from his predecessor in the same post , who had been his patron and instructor , and whom he seemed to trust implicitly . Up to a certain point it was a common enough tale of the decline of a great family ' s fortunes -- the tale of a family lawyer ."
chesterton#"His lawyer , however , had the sense to cheat honestly , if the expression explains itself . Instead of using funds he held in trust , he took advantage of the Duke ' s carelessness to put the family in a financial hole , in which it might be necessary for the Duke to let him hold them in reality . The lawyer ' s name was Isaac Green , but the Duke always called him Elisha ; presumably in reference to the fact that he was quite bald , though certainly not more than thirty . He had risen very rapidly , but from very dirty beginnings ; being first a "" nark "" or informer , and then a money - lender : but as solicitor to the Eyres he had the sense , as I say , to keep technically straight until he was ready to deal the final blow . The blow fell at dinner ; and the old librarian said he should never forget the very look of the lampshades and the decanters , as the little lawyer , with a steady smile , proposed to the great landlord that they should halve the estates between them . The sequel certainly could not be overlooked ; for the Duke , in dead silence , smashed a decanter on the man ' s bald head as suddenly as I had seen him smash the glass that day in the orchard ."
chesterton#"It left a red triangular scar on the scalp , and the lawyer ' s eyes altered , but not his smile . He rose tottering to his feet , and struck back as such men do strike . "" I am glad of that ,"" he said , "" for now I can take the whole estate . The law will give it to me ."" Exmoor , it seems , was white as ashes , but his eyes still blazed . "" The law will give it you ,"" he said ; "" but you will not take it .... Why not ?"
chesterton#"Why ? because it would mean the crack of doom for me , and if you take it I shall take off my wig .... Why , you pitiful plucked fowl , anyone can see your bare head . But no man shall see mine and live ."" Well , you may say what you like and make it mean what you like . But Mull swears it is the solemn fact that the lawyer , after shaking his knotted fists in the air for an instant , simply ran from the room and never reappeared in the countryside ; and since then Exmoor has been feared more for a warlock than even for a landlord and a magistrate . Now Dr Mull told his story with rather wild theatrical gestures , and with a passion I think at least partisan ."
chesterton#"I was quite conscious of the possibility that the whole was the extravagance of an old braggart and gossip . But before I end this half of my discoveries , I think it due to Dr Mull to record that my two first inquiries have confirmed his story . I learned from an old apothecary in the village that there was a bald man in evening dress , giving the name of Green , who came to him one night to have a three - cornered cut on his forehead plastered . And I learnt from the legal records and old newspapers that there was a lawsuit threatened , and at least begun , by one Green against the Duke of Exmoor . Mr Nutt , of the Daily Reformer , wrote some highly incongruous words across the top of the copy , made some highly mysterious marks down the side of it , and called to Miss Barlow in the same loud , monotonous voice : "" Take down a letter to Mr Finn ."" DEAR FINN ,-- Your copy will do , but I have had to headline it a bit ; and our public would never stand a Romanist priest in the story -- you must keep your eye on the suburbs ."
chesterton#I ' ve altered him to Mr Brown , a Spiritualist . Yours , E . NUTT . A day or two afterward found the active and judicious editor examining , with blue eyes that seemed to grow rounder and rounder , the second instalment of Mr Finn ' s tale of mysteries in high life . It began with the words : I have made an astounding discovery .
chesterton#I freely confess it is quite different from anything I expected to discover , and will give a much more practical shock to the public . I venture to say , without any vanity , that the words I now write will be read all over Europe , and certainly all over America and the Colonies . And yet I heard all I have to tell before I left this same little wooden table in this same little wood of apple - trees . I owe it all to the small priest Brown ; he is an extraordinary man . The big librarian had left the table , perhaps ashamed of his long tongue , perhaps anxious about the storm in which his mysterious master had vanished : anyway , he betook himself heavily in the Duke ' s tracks through the trees . Father Brown had picked up one of the lemons and was eyeing it with an odd pleasure .
chesterton#""" What a lovely colour a lemon is !"" he said . "" There ' s one thing I don ' t like about the Duke ' s wig -- the colour ."" "" I don ' t think I understand ,"" I answered . "" I dare say he ' s got good reason to cover his ears , like King Midas ,"" went on the priest , with a cheerful simplicity which somehow seemed rather flippant under the circumstances . "" I can quite understand that it ' s nicer to cover them with hair than with brass plates or leather flaps ."
chesterton#But if he wants to use hair , why doesn ' t he make it look like hair ? There never was hair of that colour in this world . It looks more like a sunset - cloud coming through the wood . Why doesn ' t he conceal the family curse better , if he ' s really so ashamed of it ? Shall I tell you ? It ' s because he isn ' t ashamed of it .
chesterton#"He ' s proud of it "" "" It ' s an ugly wig to be proud of -- and an ugly story ,"" I said . "" Consider ,"" replied this curious little man , "" how you yourself really feel about such things . I don ' t suggest you ' re either more snobbish or more morbid than the rest of us : but don ' t you feel in a vague way that a genuine old family curse is rather a fine thing to have ? Would you be ashamed , wouldn ' t you be a little proud , if the heir of the Glamis horror called you his friend ? or if Byron ' s family had confided , to you only , the evil adventures of their race ?"
chesterton#"Don ' t be too hard on the aristocrats themselves if their heads are as weak as ours would be , and they are snobs about their own sorrows ."" "" By Jove !"" I cried ; "" and that ' s true enough . My own mother ' s family had a banshee ; and , now I come to think of it , it has comforted me in many a cold hour ."" "" And think ,"" he went on , "" of that stream of blood and poison that spurted from his thin lips the instant you so much as mentioned his ancestors . Why should he show every stranger over such a Chamber of Horrors unless he is proud of it ?"
chesterton#"He doesn ' t conceal his wig , he doesn ' t conceal his blood , he doesn ' t conceal his family curse , he doesn ' t conceal the family crimes -- but --"" The little man ' s voice changed so suddenly , he shut his hand so sharply , and his eyes so rapidly grew rounder and brighter like a waking owl ' s , that it had all the abruptness of a small explosion on the table . "" But ,"" he ended , "" he does really conceal his toilet ."" It somehow completed the thrill of my fanciful nerves that at that instant the Duke appeared again silently among the glimmering trees , with his soft foot and sunset - hued hair , coming round the corner of the house in company with his librarian . Before he came within earshot , Father Brown had added quite composedly , "" Why does he really hide the secret of what he does with the purple wig ? Because it isn ' t the sort of secret we suppose ."""
chesterton#"The Duke came round the corner and resumed his seat at the head of the table with all his native dignity . The embarrassment of the librarian left him hovering on his hind legs , like a huge bear . The Duke addressed the priest with great seriousness . "" Father Brown ,"" he said , "" Doctor Mull informs me that you have come here to make a request . I no longer profess an observance of the religion of my fathers ; but for their sakes , and for the sake of the days when we met before , I am very willing to hear you . But I presume you would rather be heard in private ."""
chesterton#"Whatever I retain of the gentleman made me stand up . Whatever I have attained of the journalist made me stand still . Before this paralysis could pass , the priest had made a momentarily detaining motion . "" If ,"" he said , "" your Grace will permit me my real petition , or if I retain any right to advise you , I would urge that as many people as possible should be present . All over this country I have found hundreds , even of my own faith and flock , whose imaginations are poisoned by the spell which I implore you to break . I wish we could have all Devonshire here to see you do it ."""
chesterton#""" To see me do what ?"" asked the Duke , arching his eyebrows . "" To see you take off your wig ,"" said Father Brown . The Duke ' s face did not move ; but he looked at his petitioner with a glassy stare which was the most awful expression I have ever seen on a human face . I could see the librarian ' s great legs wavering under him like the shadows of stems in a pool ; and I could not banish from my own brain the fancy that the trees all around us were filling softly in the silence with devils instead of birds . "" I spare you ,"" said the Duke in a voice of inhuman pity ."
chesterton#""" I refuse . If I gave you the faintest hint of the load of horror I have to bear alone , you would lie shrieking at these feet of mine and begging to know no more . I will spare you the hint . You shall not spell the first letter of what is written on the altar of the Unknown God ."" "" I know the Unknown God ,"" said the little priest , with an unconscious grandeur of certitude that stood up like a granite tower . "" I know his name ; it is Satan ."
chesterton#"The true God was made flesh and dwelt among us . And I say to you , wherever you find men ruled merely by mystery , it is the mystery of iniquity . If the devil tells you something is too fearful to look at , look at it . If he says something is too terrible to hear , hear it . If you think some truth unbearable , bear it . I entreat your Grace to end this nightmare now and here at this table ."""
chesterton#""" If I did ,"" said the Duke in a low voice , "" you and all you believe , and all by which alone you live , would be the first to shrivel and perish . You would have an instant to know the great Nothing before you died ."" "" The Cross of Christ be between me and harm ,"" said Father Brown . "" Take off your wig ."" I was leaning over the table in ungovernable excitement ; in listening to this extraordinary duel half a thought had come into my head . "" Your Grace ,"" I cried , "" I call your bluff ."
chesterton#"Take off that wig or I will knock it off ."" I suppose I can be prosecuted for assault , but I am very glad I did it . When he said , in the same voice of stone , "" I refuse ,"" I simply sprang on him . For three long instants he strained against me as if he had all hell to help him ; but I forced his head until the hairy cap fell off it . I admit that , whilst wrestling , I shut my eyes as it fell . I was awakened by a cry from Mull , who was also by this time at the Duke ' s side ."
chesterton#"His head and mine were both bending over the bald head of the wigless Duke . Then the silence was snapped by the librarian exclaiming : "" What can it mean ? Why , the man had nothing to hide . His ears are just like everybody else ' s ."" "" Yes ,"" said Father Brown , "" that is what he had to hide ."" The priest walked straight up to him , but strangely enough did not even glance at his ears ."
chesterton#"He stared with an almost comical seriousness at his bald forehead , and pointed to a three - cornered cicatrice , long healed , but still discernible . "" Mr Green , I think ."" he said politely , "" and he did get the whole estate after all ."" And now let me tell the readers of the Daily Reformer what I think the most remarkable thing in the whole affair . This transformation scene , which will seem to you as wild and purple as a Persian fairy - tale , has been ( except for my technical assault ) strictly legal and constitutional from its first beginnings . This man with the odd scar and the ordinary ears is not an impostor ."
chesterton#Though ( in one sense ) he wears another man ' s wig and claims another man ' s ear , he has not stolen another man ' s coronet . He really is the one and only Duke of Exmoor . What happened was this . The old Duke really had a slight malformation of the ear , which really was more or less hereditary . He really was morbid about it ; and it is likely enough that he did invoke it as a kind of curse in the violent scene ( which undoubtedly happened ) in which he struck Green with the decanter . But the contest ended very differently .
chesterton#"Green pressed his claim and got the estates ; the dispossessed nobleman shot himself and died without issue . After a decent interval the beautiful English Government revived the "" extinct "" peerage of Exmoor , and bestowed it , as is usual , on the most important person , the person who had got the property . This man used the old feudal fables -- properly , in his snobbish soul , really envied and admired them . So that thousands of poor English people trembled before a mysterious chieftain with an ancient destiny and a diadem of evil stars -- when they are really trembling before a guttersnipe who was a pettifogger and a pawnbroker not twelve years ago . I think it very typical of the real case against our aristocracy as it is , and as it will be till God sends us braver men . Mr Nutt put down the manuscript and called out with unusual sharpness : "" Miss Barlow , please take down a letter to Mr Finn ."""
chesterton#DEAR FINN ,-- You must be mad ; we can ' t touch this . I wanted vampires and the bad old days and aristocracy hand - in - hand with superstition . They like that But you must know the Exmoors would never forgive this . And what would our people say then , I should like to know ! Why , Sir Simon is one of Exmoor ' s greatest pals ; and it would ruin that cousin of the Eyres that ' s standing for us at Bradford . Besides , old Soap - Suds was sick enough at not getting his peerage last year ; he ' d sack me by wire if I lost him it with such lunacy as this .
chesterton#"And what about Duffey ? He ' s doing us some rattling articles on "" The Heel of the Norman ."" And how can he write about Normans if the man ' s only a solicitor ? Do be reasonable .-- Yours , E . NUTT . As Miss Barlow rattled away cheerfully , he crumpled up the copy and tossed it into the waste - paper basket ; but not before he had , automatically and by force of habit , altered the word "" God "" to the word "" circumstances ."" VIII ."
chesterton#The Perishing of the Pendragons FATHER BROWN was in no mood for adventures . He had lately fallen ill with over - work , and when he began to recover , his friend Flambeau had taken him on a cruise in a small yacht with Sir Cecil Fanshaw , a young Cornish squire and an enthusiast for Cornish coast scenery . But Brown was still rather weak ; he was no very happy sailor ; and though he was never of the sort that either grumbles or breaks down , his spirits did not rise above patience and civility . When the other two men praised the ragged violet sunset or the ragged volcanic crags , he agreed with them . When Flambeau pointed out a rock shaped like a dragon , he looked at it and thought it very like a dragon .
chesterton#"When Fanshaw more excitedly indicated a rock that was like Merlin , he looked at it , and signified assent . When Flambeau asked whether this rocky gate of the twisted river was not the gate of Fairyland , he said "" Yes ."" He heard the most important things and the most trivial with the same tasteless absorption . He heard that the coast was death to all but careful seamen ; he also heard that the ship ' s cat was asleep . He heard that Fanshaw couldn ' t find his cigar - holder anywhere ; he also heard the pilot deliver the oracle "" Both eyes bright , she ' s all right ; one eye winks , down she sinks ."" He heard Flambeau say to Fanshaw that no doubt this meant the pilot must keep both eyes open and be spry ."
chesterton#"And he heard Fanshaw say to Flambeau that , oddly enough , it didn ' t mean this : it meant that while they saw two of the coast lights , one near and the other distant , exactly side by side , they were in the right river - channel ; but that if one light was hidden behind the other , they were going on the rocks . He heard Fanshaw add that his country was full of such quaint fables and idioms ; it was the very home of romance ; he even pitted this part of Cornwall against Devonshire , as a claimant to the laurels of Elizabethan seamanship . According to him there had been captains among these coves and islets compared with whom Drake was practically a landsman . He heard Flambeau laugh , and ask if , perhaps , the adventurous title of "" Westward Ho !"" only meant that all Devonshire men wished they were living in Cornwall . He heard Fanshaw say there was no need to be silly ; that not only had Cornish captains been heroes , but that they were heroes still : that near that very spot there was an old admiral , now retired , who was scarred by thrilling voyages full of adventures ; and who had in his youth found the last group of eight Pacific Islands that was added to the chart of the world ."
chesterton#This Cecil Fanshaw was , in person , of the kind that commonly urges such crude but pleasing enthusiasms ; a very young man , light - haired , high - coloured , with an eager profile ; with a boyish bravado of spirits , but an almost girlish delicacy of tint and type . The big shoulders , black brows and black mousquetaire swagger of Flambeau were a great contrast . All these trivialities Brown heard and saw ; but heard them as a tired man hears a tune in the railway wheels , or saw them as a sick man sees the pattern of his wall - paper . No one can calculate the turns of mood in convalescence : but Father Brown ' s depression must have had a great deal to do with his mere unfamiliarity with the sea . For as the river mouth narrowed like the neck of a bottle , and the water grew calmer and the air warmer and more earthly , he seemed to wake up and take notice like a baby . They had reached that phase just after sunset when air and water both look bright , but earth and all its growing things look almost black by comparison .
chesterton#About this particular evening , however , there was something exceptional . It was one of those rare atmospheres in which a smoked - glass slide seems to have been slid away from between us and Nature ; so that even dark colours on that day look more gorgeous than bright colours on cloudier days . The trampled earth of the river - banks and the peaty stain in the pools did not look drab but glowing umber , and the dark woods astir in the breeze did not look , as usual , dim blue with mere depth of distance , but more like wind - tumbled masses of some vivid violet blossom . This magic clearness and intensity in the colours was further forced on Brown ' s slowly reviving senses by something romantic and even secret in the very form of the landscape . The river was still well wide and deep enough for a pleasure boat so small as theirs ; but the curves of the country - side suggested that it was closing in on either hand ; the woods seemed to be making broken and flying attempts at bridge - building -- as if the boat were passing from the romance of a valley to the romance of a hollow and so to the supreme romance of a tunnel . Beyond this mere look of things there was little for Brown ' s freshening fancy to feed on ; he saw no human beings , except some gipsies trailing along the river bank , with faggots and osiers cut in the forest ; and one sight no longer unconventional , but in such remote parts still uncommon : a dark - haired lady , bare - headed , and paddling her own canoe .
chesterton#If Father Brown ever attached any importance to either of these , he certainly forgot them at the next turn of the river which brought in sight a singular object . The water seemed to widen and split , being cloven by the dark wedge of a fish - shaped and wooded islet . With the rate at which they went , the islet seemed to swim towards them like a ship ; a ship with a very high prow -- or , to speak more strictly , a very high funnel . For at the extreme point nearest them stood up an odd - looking building , unlike anything they could remember or connect with any purpose . It was not specially high , but it was too high for its breadth to be called anything but a tower . Yet it appeared to be built entirely of wood , and that in a most unequal and eccentric way .
chesterton#Some of the planks and beams were of good , seasoned oak ; some of such wood cut raw and recent ; some again of white pinewood , and a great deal more of the same sort of wood painted black with tar . These black beams were set crooked or crisscross at all kinds of angles , giving the whole a most patchy and puzzling appearance . There were one or two windows , which appeared to be coloured and leaded in an old - fashioned but more elaborate style . The travellers looked at it with that paradoxical feeling we have when something reminds us of something , and yet we are certain it is something very different . Father Brown , even when he was mystified , was clever in analysing his own mystification . And he found himself reflecting that the oddity seemed to consist in a particular shape cut out in an incongruous material ; as if one saw a top - hat made of tin , or a frock - coat cut out of tartan .
chesterton#"He was sure he had seen timbers of different tints arranged like that somewhere , but never in such architectural proportions . The next moment a glimpse through the dark trees told him all he wanted to know and he laughed . Through a gap in the foliage there appeared for a moment one of those old wooden houses , faced with black beams , which are still to be found here and there in England , but which most of us see imitated in some show called "" Old London "" or "" Shakespeare ' s England '. It was in view only long enough for the priest to see that , however old - fashioned , it was a comfortable and well - kept country - house , with flower - beds in front of it . It had none of the piebald and crazy look of the tower that seemed made out of its refuse . "" What on earth ' s this ?"""
chesterton#"said Flambeau , who was still staring at the tower . Fanshaw ' s eyes were shining , and he spoke triumphantly . "" Aha ! you ' ve not seen a place quite like this before , I fancy ; that ' s why I ' ve brought you here , my friend . Now you shall see whether I exaggerate about the mariners of Cornwall . This place belongs to Old Pendragon , whom we call the Admiral ; though he retired before getting the rank ."
chesterton#"The spirit of Raleigh and Hawkins is a memory with the Devon folk ; it ' s a modern fact with the Pendragons . If Queen Elizabeth were to rise from the grave and come up this river in a gilded barge , she would be received by the Admiral in a house exactly such as she was accustomed to , in every corner and casement , in every panel on the wall or plate on the table . And she would find an English Captain still talking fiercely of fresh lands to be found in little ships , as much as if she had dined with Drake ."" "" She ' d find a rum sort of thing in the garden ,"" said Father Brown , "" which would not please her Renaissance eye . That Elizabethan domestic architecture is charming in its way ; but it ' s against the very nature of it to break out into turrets ."" "" And yet ,"" answered Fanshaw , "" that ' s the most romantic and Elizabethan part of the business ."
chesterton#"It was built by the Pendragons in the very days of the Spanish wars ; and though it ' s needed patching and even rebuilding for another reason , it ' s always been rebuilt in the old way . The story goes that the lady of Sir Peter Pendragon built it in this place and to this height , because from the top you can just see the corner where vessels turn into the river mouth ; and she wished to be the first to see her husband ' s ship , as he sailed home from the Spanish Main ."" "" For what other reason ,"" asked Father Brown , "" do you mean that it has been rebuilt ?"" "" Oh , there ' s a strange story about that , too ,"" said the young squire with relish . "" You are really in a land of strange stories . King Arthur was here and Merlin and the fairies before him ."
chesterton#The story goes that Sir Peter Pendragon , who ( I fear ) had some of the faults of the pirates as well as the virtues of the sailor , was bringing home three Spanish gentlemen in honourable captivity , intending to escort them to Elizabeth ' s court . But he was a man of flaming and tigerish temper , and coming to high words with one of them , he caught him by the throat and flung him by accident or design , into the sea . A second Spaniard , who was the brother of the first , instantly drew his sword and flew at Pendragon , and after a short but furious combat in which both got three wounds in as many minutes , Pendragon drove his blade through the other ' s body and the second Spaniard was accounted for . As it happened the ship had already turned into the river mouth and was close to comparatively shallow water . The third Spaniard sprang over the side of the ship , struck out for the shore , and was soon near enough to it to stand up to his waist in water . And turning again to face the ship , and holding up both arms to Heaven -- like a prophet calling plagues upon a wicked city -- he called out to Pendragon in a piercing and terrible voice , that he at least was yet living , that he would go on living , that he would live for ever ; and that generation after generation the house of Pendragon should never see him or his , but should know by very certain signs that he and his vengeance were alive .
chesterton#"With that he dived under the wave , and was either drowned or swam so long under water that no hair of his head was seen afterwards ."" "" There ' s that girl in the canoe again ,"" said Flambeau irrelevantly , for good - looking young women would call him off any topic . "" She seems bothered by the queer tower just as we were ."" Indeed , the black - haired young lady was letting her canoe float slowly and silently past the strange islet ; and was looking intently up at the strange tower , with a strong glow of curiosity on her oval and olive face . "" Never mind girls ,"" said Fanshaw impatiently , "" there are plenty of them in the world , but not many things like the Pendragon Tower . As you may easily suppose , plenty of superstitions and scandals have followed in the track of the Spaniard ' s curse ; and no doubt , as you would put it , any accident happening to this Cornish family would be connected with it by rural credulity ."
chesterton#"But it is perfectly true that this tower has been burnt down two or three times ; and the family can ' t be called lucky , for more than two , I think , of the Admiral ' s near kin have perished by shipwreck ; and one at least , to my own knowledge , on practically the same spot where Sir Peter threw the Spaniard overboard ."" "" What a pity !"" exclaimed Flambeau . "" She ' s going ."" "" When did your friend the Admiral tell you this family history ?"" asked Father Brown , as the girl in the canoe paddled off , without showing the least intention of extending her interest from the tower to the yacht , which Fanshaw had already caused to lie alongside the island ."
chesterton#""" Many years ago ,"" replied Fanshaw ; "" he hasn ' t been to sea for some time now , though he is as keen on it as ever . I believe there ' s a family compact or something . Well , here ' s the landing stage ; let ' s come ashore and see the old boy ."" They followed him on to the island , just under the tower , and Father Brown , whether from the mere touch of dry land , or the interest of something on the other bank of the river ( which he stared at very hard for some seconds ), seemed singularly improved in briskness . They entered a wooded avenue between two fences of thin greyish wood , such as often enclose parks or gardens , and over the top of which the dark trees tossed to and fro like black and purple plumes upon the hearse of a giant . The tower , as they left it behind , looked all the quainter , because such entrances are usually flanked by two towers ; and this one looked lopsided ."
chesterton#"But for this , the avenue had the usual appearance of the entrance to a gentleman ' s grounds ; and , being so curved that the house was now out of sight , somehow looked a much larger park than any plantation on such an island could really be . Father Brown was , perhaps , a little fanciful in his fatigue , but he almost thought the whole place must be growing larger , as things do in a nightmare . Anyhow , a mystical monotony was the only character of their march , until Fanshaw suddenly stopped , and pointed to something sticking out through the grey fence -- something that looked at first rather like the imprisoned horn of some beast . Closer observation showed that it was a slightly curved blade of metal that shone faintly in the fading light . Flambeau , who like all Frenchmen had been a soldier , bent over it and said in a startled voice : "" Why , it ' s a sabre ! I believe I know the sort , heavy and curved , but shorter than the cavalry ; they used to have them in artillery and the --"""
chesterton#"As he spoke the blade plucked itself out of the crack it had made and came down again with a more ponderous slash , splitting the fissiparous fence to the bottom with a rending noise . Then it was pulled out again , flashed above the fence some feet further along , and again split it halfway down with the first stroke ; and after waggling a little to extricate itself ( accompanied with curses in the darkness ) split it down to the ground with a second . Then a kick of devilish energy sent the whole loosened square of thin wood flying into the pathway , and a great gap of dark coppice gaped in the paling . Fanshaw peered into the dark opening and uttered an exclamation of astonishment . "" My dear Admiral !"" he exclaimed , "" do you -- er -- do you generally cut out a new front door whenever you want to go for a walk ?"""
chesterton#"The voice in the gloom swore again , and then broke into a jolly laugh . "" No ,"" it said ; "" I ' ve really got to cut down this fence somehow ; it ' s spoiling all the plants , and no one else here can do it . But I ' ll only carve another bit off the front door , and then come out and welcome you ."" And sure enough , he heaved up his weapon once more , and , hacking twice , brought down another and similar strip of fence , making the opening about fourteen feet wide in all . Then through this larger forest gateway he came out into the evening light , with a chip of grey wood sticking to his sword - blade . He momentarily fulfilled all Fanshaw ' s fable of an old piratical Admiral ; though the details seemed afterwards to decompose into accidents ."
chesterton#For instance , he wore a broad - brimmed hat as protection against the sun ; but the front flap of it was turned up straight to the sky , and the two corners pulled down lower than the ears , so that it stood across his forehead in a crescent like the old cocked hat worn by Nelson . He wore an ordinary dark - blue jacket , with nothing special about the buttons , but the combination of it with white linen trousers somehow had a sailorish look . He was tall and loose , and walked with a sort of swagger , which was not a sailor ' s roll , and yet somehow suggested it ; and he held in his hand a short sabre which was like a navy cutlass , but about twice as big . Under the bridge of the hat his eagle face looked eager , all the more because it was not only clean - shaven , but without eyebrows . It seemed almost as if all the hair had come off his face from his thrusting it through a throng of elements . His eyes were prominent and piercing .
chesterton#"His colour was curiously attractive , while partly tropical ; it reminded one vaguely of a blood - orange . That is , that while it was ruddy and sanguine , there was a yellow in it that was in no way sickly , but seemed rather to glow like gold apples of the Hesperides -- Father Brown thought he had never seen a figure so expressive of all the romances about the countries of the Sun . When Fanshaw had presented his two friends to their host he fell again into a tone of rallying the latter about his wreckage of the fence and his apparent rage of profanity . The Admiral pooh - poohed it at first as a piece of necessary but annoying garden work ; but at length the ring of real energy came back into his laughter , and he cried with a mixture of impatience and good humour : "" Well , perhaps I do go at it a bit rabidly , and feel a kind of pleasure in smashing anything . So would you if your only pleasure was in cruising about to find some new Cannibal Islands , and you had to stick on this muddy little rockery in a sort of rustic pond ."
chesterton#"When I remember how I ' ve cut down a mile and a half of green poisonous jungle with an old cutlass half as sharp as this ; and then remember I must stop here and chop this matchwood , because of some confounded old bargain scribbled in a family Bible , why , I --"" He swung up the heavy steel again ; and this time sundered the wall of wood from top to bottom at one stroke . "" I feel like that ,"" he said laughing , but furiously flinging the sword some yards down the path , "" and now let ' s go up to the house ; you must have some dinner ."" The semicircle of lawn in front of the house was varied by three circular garden beds , one of red tulips , a second of yellow tulips , and the third of some white , waxen - looking blossoms that the visitors did not know and presumed to be exotic . A heavy , hairy and rather sullen - looking gardener was hanging up a heavy coil of garden hose . The corners of the expiring sunset which seemed to cling about the corners of the house gave glimpses here and there of the colours of remoter flowerbeds ; and in a treeless space on one side of the house opening upon the river stood a tall brass tripod on which was tilted a big brass telescope ."
chesterton#Just outside the steps of the porch stood a little painted green garden table , as if someone had just had tea there . The entrance was flanked with two of those half - featured lumps of stone with holes for eyes that are said to be South Sea idols ; and on the brown oak beam across the doorway were some confused carvings that looked almost as barbaric . As they passed indoors , the little cleric hopped suddenly on to the table , and standing on it peered unaffectedly through his spectacles at the mouldings in the oak . Admiral Pendragon looked very much astonished , though not particularly annoyed ; while Fanshaw was so amused with what looked like a performing pigmy on his little stand , that he could not control his laughter . But Father Brown was not likely to notice either the laughter or the astonishment . He was gazing at three carved symbols , which , though very worn and obscure , seemed still to convey some sense to him .
chesterton#"The first seemed to be the outline of some tower or other building , crowned with what looked like curly - pointed ribbons . The second was clearer : an old Elizabethan galley with decorative waves beneath it , but interrupted in the middle by a curious jagged rock , which was either a fault in the wood or some conventional representation of the water coming in . The third represented the upper half of a human figure , ending in an escalloped line like the waves ; the face was rubbed and featureless , and both arms were held very stiffly up in the air . "" Well ,"" muttered Father Brown , blinking , "" here is the legend of the Spaniard plain enough . Here he is holding up his arms and cursing in the sea ; and here are the two curses : the wrecked ship and the burning of Pendragon Tower ."" Pendragon shook his head with a kind of venerable amusement ."
chesterton#""" And how many other things might it not be ?"" he said . "" Don ' t you know that that sort of half - man , like a half - lion or half - stag , is quite common in heraldry ? Might not that line through the ship be one of those parti - per - pale lines , indented , I think they call it ? And though the third thing isn ' t so very heraldic , it would be more heraldic to suppose it a tower crowned with laurel than with fire ; and it looks just as like it ."" "" But it seems rather odd ,"" said Flambeau , "" that it should exactly confirm the old legend ."""
chesterton#""" Ah ,"" replied the sceptical traveller , "" but you don ' t know how much of the old legend may have been made up from the old figures . Besides , it isn ' t the only old legend . Fanshaw , here , who is fond of such things , will tell you there are other versions of the tale , and much more horrible ones . One story credits my unfortunate ancestor with having had the Spaniard cut in two ; and that will fit the pretty picture also . Another obligingly credits our family with the possession of a tower full of snakes and explains those little , wriggly things in that way . And a third theory supposes the crooked line on the ship to be a conventionalized thunderbolt ; but that alone , if seriously examined , would show what a very little way these unhappy coincidences really go ."""
chesterton#""" Why , how do you mean ?"" asked Fanshaw . "" It so happens ,"" replied his host coolly , "" that there was no thunder and lightning at all in the two or three shipwrecks I know of in our family ."" "" Oh !"" said Father Brown , and jumped down from the little table . There was another silence in which they heard the continuous murmur of the river ; then Fanshaw said , in a doubtful and perhaps disappointed tone : "" Then you don ' t think there is anything in the tales of the tower in flames ?"""
chesterton#""" There are the tales , of course ,"" said the Admiral , shrugging his shoulders ; "" and some of them , I don ' t deny , on evidence as decent as one ever gets for such things . Someone saw a blaze hereabout , don ' t you know , as he walked home through a wood ; someone keeping sheep on the uplands inland thought he saw a flame hovering over Pendragon Tower . Well , a damp dab of mud like this confounded island seems the last place where one would think of fires ."" "" What is that fire over there ?"" asked Father Brown with a gentle suddenness , pointing to the woods on the left river - bank . They were all thrown a little off their balance , and the more fanciful Fanshaw had even some difficulty in recovering his , as they saw a long , thin stream of blue smoke ascending silently into the end of the evening light ."
chesterton#"Then Pendragon broke into a scornful laugh again . "" Gipsies !"" he said ; "" they ' ve been camping about here for about a week . Gentlemen , you want your dinner ,"" and he turned as if to enter the house . But the antiquarian superstition in Fanshaw was still quivering , and he said hastily : "" But , Admiral , what ' s that hissing noise quite near the island ? It ' s very like fire ."""
chesterton#""" It ' s more like what it is ,"" said the Admiral , laughing as he led the way ; "" it ' s only some canoe going by ."" Almost as he spoke , the butler , a lean man in black , with very black hair and a very long , yellow face , appeared in the doorway and told him that dinner was served . The dining - room was as nautical as the cabin of a ship ; but its note was rather that of the modern than the Elizabethan captain . There were , indeed , three antiquated cutlasses in a trophy over the fireplace , and one brown sixteenth - century map with Tritons and little ships dotted about a curly sea . But such things were less prominent on the white panelling than some cases of quaint - coloured South American birds , very scientifically stuffed , fantastic shells from the Pacific , and several instruments so rude and queer in shape that savages might have used them either to kill their enemies or to cook them . But the alien colour culminated in the fact that , besides the butler , the Admiral ' s only servants were two negroes , somewhat quaintly clad in tight uniforms of yellow ."
chesterton#"The priest ' s instinctive trick of analysing his own impressions told him that the colour and the little neat coat - tails of these bipeds had suggested the word "" Canary ,"" and so by a mere pun connected them with southward travel . Towards the end of the dinner they took their yellow clothes and black faces out of the room , leaving only the black clothes and yellow face of the butler . "" I ' m rather sorry you take this so lightly ,"" said Fanshaw to the host ; "" for the truth is , I ' ve brought these friends of mine with the idea of their helping you , as they know a good deal of these things . Don ' t you really believe in the family story at all ?"" "" I don ' t believe in anything ,"" answered Pendragon very briskly , with a bright eye cocked at a red tropical bird . "" I ' m a man of science ."""
chesterton#"Rather to Flambeau ' s surprise , his clerical friend , who seemed to have entirely woken up , took up the digression and talked natural history with his host with a flow of words and much unexpected information , until the dessert and decanters were set down and the last of the servants vanished . Then he said , without altering his tone . "" Please don ' t think me impertinent , Admiral Pendragon . I don ' t ask for curiosity , but really for my guidance and your convenience . Have I made a bad shot if I guess you don ' t want these old things talked of before your butler ?"" The Admiral lifted the hairless arches over his eyes and exclaimed : "" Well , I don ' t know where you got it , but the truth is I can ' t stand the fellow , though I ' ve no excuse for discharging a family servant ."
chesterton#"Fanshaw , with his fairy tales , would say my blood moved against men with that black , Spanish - looking hair ."" Flambeau struck the table with his heavy fist . "" By Jove !"" he cried ; "" and so had that girl !"" "" I hope it ' ll all end tonight ,"" continued the Admiral , "" when my nephew comes back safe from his ship . You looked surprised ."
chesterton#"You won ' t understand , I suppose , unless I tell you the story . You see , my father had two sons ; I remained a bachelor , but my elder brother married , and had a son who became a sailor like all the rest of us , and will inherit the proper estate . Well , my father was a strange man ; he somehow combined Fanshaw ' s superstition with a good deal of my scepticism -- they were always fighting in him ; and after my first voyages , he developed a notion which he thought somehow would settle finally whether the curse was truth or trash . If all the Pendragons sailed about anyhow , he thought there would be too much chance of natural catastrophes to prove anything . But if we went to sea one at a time in strict order of succession to the property , he thought it might show whether any connected fate followed the family as a family . It was a silly notion , I think , and I quarrelled with my father pretty heartily ; for I was an ambitious man and was left to the last , coming , by succession , after my own nephew ."""
chesterton#""" And your father and brother ,"" said the priest , very gently , "" died at sea , I fear ."" "" Yes ,"" groaned the Admiral ; "" by one of those brutal accidents on which are built all the lying mythologies of mankind , they were both shipwrecked . My father , coming up this coast out of the Atlantic , was washed up on these Cornish rocks . My brother ' s ship was sunk , no one knows where , on the voyage home from Tasmania . His body was never found . I tell you it was from perfectly natural mishap ; lots of other people besides Pendragons were drowned ; and both disasters are discussed in a normal way by navigators ."
chesterton#"But , of course , it set this forest of superstition on fire ; and men saw the flaming tower everywhere . That ' s why I say it will be all right when Walter returns . The girl he ' s engaged to was coming today ; but I was so afraid of some chance delay frightening her that I wired her not to come till she heard from me . But he ' s practically sure to be here some time tonight , and then it ' ll all end in smoke -- tobacco smoke . We ' ll crack that old lie when we crack a bottle of this wine ."" "" Very good wine ,"" said Father Brown , gravely lifting his glass , "" but , as you see , a very bad wine - bibber ."
chesterton#"I most sincerely beg your pardon "": for he had spilt a small spot of wine on the table - cloth . He drank and put down the glass with a composed face ; but his hand had started at the exact moment when he became conscious of a face looking in through the garden window just behind the Admiral -- the face of a woman , swarthy , with southern hair and eyes , and young , but like a mask of tragedy . After a pause the priest spoke again in his mild manner . "" Admiral ,"" he said , "" will you do me a favour ? Let me , and my friends if they like , stop in that tower of yours just for tonight ? Do you know that in my business you ' re an exorcist almost before anything else ?"""
chesterton#"Pendragon sprang to his feet and paced swiftly to and fro across the window , from which the face had instantly vanished . "" I tell you there is nothing in it ,"" he cried , with ringing violence . "" There is one thing I know about this matter . You may call me an atheist . I am an atheist ."" Here he swung round and fixed Father Brown with a face of frightful concentration ."
chesterton#""" This business is perfectly natural . There is no curse in it at all ."" Father Brown smiled . "" In that case ,"" he said , "" there can ' t be any objection to my sleeping in your delightful summer - house ."" "" The idea is utterly ridiculous ,"" replied the Admiral , beating a tattoo on the back of his chair . "" Please forgive me for everything ,"" said Brown in his most sympathetic tone , "" including spilling the wine ."
chesterton#"But it seems to me you are not quite so easy about the flaming tower as you try to be ."" Admiral Pendragon sat down again as abruptly as he had risen ; but he sat quite still , and when he spoke again it was in a lower voice . "" You do it at your own peril ,"" he said ; "" but wouldn ' t you be an atheist to keep sane in all this devilry ?"" Some three hours afterwards Fanshaw , Flambeau and the priest were still dawdling about the garden in the dark ; and it began to dawn on the other two that Father Brown had no intention of going to bed either in the tower or the house . "" I think the lawn wants weeding ,"" said he dreamily . "" If I could find a spud or something I ' d do it myself ."""
chesterton#"They followed him , laughing and half remonstrating ; but he replied with the utmost solemnity , explaining to them , in a maddening little sermon , that one can always find some small occupation that is helpful to others . He did not find a spud ; but he found an old broom made of twigs , with which he began energetically to brush the fallen leaves off the grass . "" Always some little thing to be done ,"" he said with idiotic cheerfulness ; "" as George Herbert says : ` Who sweeps an Admiral ' s garden in Cornwall as for Thy laws makes that and the action fine .' And now ,"" he added , suddenly slinging the broom away , "" Let ' s go and water the flowers ."" With the same mixed emotions they watched him uncoil some considerable lengths of the large garden hose , saying with an air of wistful discrimination : "" The red tulips before the yellow , I think . Look a bit dry , don ' t you think ?"""
chesterton#"He turned the little tap on the instrument , and the water shot out straight and solid as a long rod of steel . "" Look out , Samson ,"" cried Flambeau ; "" why , you ' ve cut off the tulip ' s head ."" Father Brown stood ruefully contemplating the decapitated plant . "" Mine does seem to be a rather kill or cure sort of watering ,"" he admitted , scratching his head . "" I suppose it ' s a pity I didn ' t find the spud . You should have seen me with the spud !"
chesterton#"Talking of tools , you ' ve got that swordstick , Flambeau , you always carry ? That ' s right ; and Sir Cecil could have that sword the Admiral threw away by the fence here . How grey everything looks !"" "" The mist ' s rising from the river ,"" said the staring Flambeau . Almost as he spoke the huge figure of the hairy gardener appeared on a higher ridge of the trenched and terraced lawn , hailing them with a brandished rake and a horribly bellowing voice . "" Put down that hose ,"" he shouted ; "" put down that hose and go to your --"""
chesterton#""" I am fearfully clumsy ,"" replied the reverend gentleman weakly ; "" do you know , I upset some wine at dinner ."" He made a wavering half - turn of apology towards the gardener , with the hose still spouting in his hand . The gardener caught the cold crash of the water full in his face like the crash of a cannon - ball ; staggered , slipped and went sprawling with his boots in the air . "" How very dreadful !"" said Father Brown , looking round in a sort of wonder . "" Why , I ' ve hit a man !"""
chesterton#"He stood with his head forward for a moment as if looking or listening ; and then set off at a trot towards the tower , still trailing the hose behind him . The tower was quite close , but its outline was curiously dim . "" Your river mist ,"" he said , "" has a rum smell ."" "" By the Lord it has ,"" cried Fanshaw , who was very white . "" But you can ' t mean --"" "" I mean ,"" said Father Brown , "" that one of the Admiral ' s scientific predictions is coming true tonight ."
chesterton#"This story is going to end in smoke ."" As he spoke a most beautiful rose - red light seemed to burst into blossom like a gigantic rose ; but accompanied with a crackling and rattling noise that was like the laughter of devils . "" My God ! what is this ?"" cried Sir Cecil Fanshaw . "" The sign of the flaming tower ,"" said Father Brown , and sent the driving water from his hose into the heart of the red patch ."
chesterton#""" Lucky we hadn ' t gone to bed !"" ejaculated Fanshaw . "" I suppose it can ' t spread to the house ."" "" You may remember ,"" said the priest quietly , "" that the wooden fence that might have carried it was cut away ."" Flambeau turned electrified eyes upon his friend , but Fanshaw only said rather absently : "" Well , nobody can be killed , anyhow ."" "" This is rather a curious kind of tower ,"" observed Father Brown , "" when it takes to killing people , it always kills people who are somewhere else ."""
chesterton#At the same instant the monstrous figure of the gardener with the streaming beard stood again on the green ridge against the sky , waving others to come on ; but now waving not a rake but a cutlass . Behind him came the two negroes , also with the old crooked cutlasses out of the trophy . But in the blood - red glare , with their black faces and yellow figures , they looked like devils carrying instruments of torture . In the dim garden behind them a distant voice was heard calling out brief directions . When the priest heard the voice , a terrible change came over his countenance . But he remained composed ; and never took his eye off the patch of flame which had begun by spreading , but now seemed to shrink a little as it hissed under the torch of the long silver spear of water .
chesterton#"He kept his finger along the nozzle of the pipe to ensure the aim , and attended to no other business , knowing only by the noise and that semi - conscious corner of the eye , the exciting incidents that began to tumble themselves about the island garden . He gave two brief directions to his friends . One was : "" Knock these fellows down somehow and tie them up , whoever they are ; there ' s rope down by those faggots . They want to take away my nice hose ."" The other was : "" As soon as you get a chance , call out to that canoeing girl ; she ' s over on the bank with the gipsies . Ask her if they could get some buckets across and fill them from the river ."""
chesterton#Then he closed his mouth and continued to water the new red flower as ruthlessly as he had watered the red tulip . He never turned his head to look at the strange fight that followed between the foes and friends of the mysterious fire . He almost felt the island shake when Flambeau collided with the huge gardener ; he merely imagined how it would whirl round them as they wrestled . He heard the crashing fall ; and his friend ' s gasp of triumph as he dashed on to the first negro ; and the cries of both the blacks as Flambeau and Fanshaw bound them . Flambeau ' s enormous strength more than redressed the odds in the fight , especially as the fourth man still hovered near the house , only a shadow and a voice . He heard also the water broken by the paddles of a canoe ; the girl ' s voice giving orders , the voices of gipsies answering and coming nearer , the plumping and sucking noise of empty buckets plunged into a full stream ; and finally the sound of many feet around the fire .
chesterton#But all this was less to him than the fact that the red rent , which had lately once more increased , had once more slightly diminished . Then came a cry that very nearly made him turn his head . Flambeau and Fanshaw , now reinforced by some of the gipsies , had rushed after the mysterious man by the house ; and he heard from the other end of the garden the Frenchman ' s cry of horror and astonishment . It was echoed by a howl not to be called human , as the being broke from their hold and ran along the garden . Three times at least it raced round the whole island , in a way that was as horrible as the chase of a lunatic , both in the cries of the pursued and the ropes carried by the pursuers ; but was more horrible still , because it somehow suggested one of the chasing games of children in a garden . Then , finding them closing in on every side , the figure sprang upon one of the higher river banks and disappeared with a splash into the dark and driving river .
chesterton#""" You can do no more , I fear ,"" said Brown in a voice cold with pain . "" He has been washed down to the rocks by now , where he has sent so many others . He knew the use of a family legend ."" "" Oh , don ' t talk in these parables ,"" cried Flambeau impatiently . "" Can ' t you put it simply in words of one syllable ?"" "" Yes ,"" answered Brown , with his eye on the hose ."
chesterton#"""` Both eyes bright , she ' s all right ; one eye blinks , down she sinks .'"" The fire hissed and shrieked more and more , like a strangled thing , as it grew narrower and narrower under the flood from the pipe and buckets , but Father Brown still kept his eye on it as he went on speaking : "" I thought of asking this young lady , if it were morning yet , to look through that telescope at the river mouth and the river . She might have seen something to interest her : the sign of the ship , or Mr Walter Pendragon coming home , and perhaps even the sign of the half - man , for though he is certainly safe by now , he may very well have waded ashore . He has been within a shave of another shipwreck ; and would never have escaped it , if the lady hadn ' t had the sense to suspect the old Admiral ' s telegram and come down to watch him . Don ' t let ' s talk about the old Admiral ."
chesterton#"Don ' t let ' s talk about anything . It ' s enough to say that whenever this tower , with its pitch and resin - wood , really caught fire , the spark on the horizon always looked like the twin light to the coast light - house ."" "" And that ,"" said Flambeau , "" is how the father and brother died . The wicked uncle of the legends very nearly got his estate after all ."" Father Brown did not answer ; indeed , he did not speak again , save for civilities , till they were all safe round a cigar - box in the cabin of the yacht . He saw that the frustrated fire was extinguished ; and then refused to linger , though he actually heard young Pendragon , escorted by an enthusiastic crowd , come tramping up the river bank ; and might ( had he been moved by romantic curiosities ) have received the combined thanks of the man from the ship and the girl from the canoe ."
chesterton#"But his fatigue had fallen on him once more , and he only started once , when Flambeau abruptly told him he had dropped cigar - ash on his trousers . "" That ' s no cigar - ash ,"" he said rather wearily . "" That ' s from the fire , but you don ' t think so because you ' re all smoking cigars . That ' s just the way I got my first faint suspicion about the chart ."" "" Do you mean Pendragon ' s chart of his Pacific Islands ?"" asked Fanshaw ."
chesterton#""" You thought it was a chart of the Pacific Islands ,"" answered Brown . "" Put a feather with a fossil and a bit of coral and everyone will think it ' s a specimen . Put the same feather with a ribbon and an artificial flower and everyone will think it ' s for a lady ' s hat . Put the same feather with an ink - bottle , a book and a stack of writing - paper , and most men will swear they ' ve seen a quill pen . So you saw that map among tropic birds and shells and thought it was a map of Pacific Islands . It was the map of this river ."""
chesterton#""" But how do you know ?"" asked Fanshaw . "" I saw the rock you thought was like a dragon , and the one like Merlin , and --"" "" You seem to have noticed a lot as we came in ,"" cried Fanshaw . "" We thought you were rather abstracted ."" "" I was sea - sick ,"" said Father Brown simply ."
chesterton#""" I felt simply horrible . But feeling horrible has nothing to do with not seeing things ."" And he closed his eyes . "" Do you think most men would have seen that ?"" asked Flambeau . He received no answer : Father Brown was asleep ."
chesterton#IX . The God of the Gongs IT was one of those chilly and empty afternoons in early winter , when the daylight is silver rather than gold and pewter rather than silver . If it was dreary in a hundred bleak offices and yawning drawing - rooms , it was drearier still along the edges of the flat Essex coast , where the monotony was the more inhuman for being broken at very long intervals by a lamp - post that looked less civilized than a tree , or a tree that looked more ugly than a lamp - post . A light fall of snow had half - melted into a few strips , also looking leaden rather than silver , when it had been fixed again by the seal of frost ; no fresh snow had fallen , but a ribbon of the old snow ran along the very margin of the coast , so as to parallel the pale ribbon of the foam . The line of the sea looked frozen in the very vividness of its violet - blue , like the vein of a frozen finger .
chesterton#For miles and miles , forward and back , there was no breathing soul , save two pedestrians , walking at a brisk pace , though one had much longer legs and took much longer strides than the other . It did not seem a very appropriate place or time for a holiday , but Father Brown had few holidays , and had to take them when he could , and he always preferred , if possible , to take them in company with his old friend Flambeau , ex - criminal and ex - detective . The priest had had a fancy for visiting his old parish at Cobhole , and was going north - eastward along the coast . After walking a mile or two farther , they found that the shore was beginning to be formally embanked , so as to form something like a parade ; the ugly lamp - posts became less few and far between and more ornamental , though quite equally ugly . Half a mile farther on Father Brown was puzzled first by little labyrinths of flowerless flower - pots , covered with the low , flat , quiet - coloured plants that look less like a garden than a tessellated pavement , between weak curly paths studded with seats with curly backs . He faintly sniffed the atmosphere of a certain sort of seaside town that be did not specially care about , and , looking ahead along the parade by the sea , he saw something that put the matter beyond a doubt .
chesterton#"In the grey distance the big bandstand of a watering - place stood up like a giant mushroom with six legs . "" I suppose ,"" said Father Brown , turning up his coat - collar and drawing a woollen scarf rather closer round his neck , "" that we are approaching a pleasure resort ."" "" I fear ,"" answered Flambeau , "" a pleasure resort to which few people just now have the pleasure of resorting . They try to revive these places in the winter , but it never succeeds except with Brighton and the old ones . This must be Seawood , I think -- Lord Pooley ' s experiment ; he had the Sicilian Singers down at Christmas , and there ' s talk about holding one of the great glove - fights here . But they ' ll have to chuck the rotten place into the sea ; it ' s as dreary as a lost railway - carriage ."""
chesterton#"They had come under the big bandstand , and the priest was looking up at it with a curiosity that had something rather odd about it , his head a little on one side , like a bird ' s . It was the conventional , rather tawdry kind of erection for its purpose : a flattened dome or canopy , gilt here and there , and lifted on six slender pillars of painted wood , the whole being raised about five feet above the parade on a round wooden platform like a drum . But there was something fantastic about the snow combined with something artificial about the gold that haunted Flambeau as well as his friend with some association he could not capture , but which he knew was at once artistic and alien . "" I ' ve got it ,"" he said at last . "" It ' s Japanese . It ' s like those fanciful Japanese prints , where the snow on the mountain looks like sugar , and the gilt on the pagodas is like gilt on gingerbread ."
chesterton#"It looks just like a little pagan temple ."" "" Yes ,"" said Father Brown . "" Let ' s have a look at the god ."" And with an agility hardly to be expected of him , he hopped up on to the raised platform . "" Oh , very well ,"" said Flambeau , laughing ; and the next instant his own towering figure was visible on that quaint elevation . Slight as was the difference of height , it gave in those level wastes a sense of seeing yet farther and farther across land and sea ."
chesterton#Inland the little wintry gardens faded into a confused grey copse ; beyond that , in the distance , were long low barns of a lonely farmhouse , and beyond that nothing but the long East Anglian plains . Seawards there was no sail or sign of life save a few seagulls : and even they looked like the last snowflakes , and seemed to float rather than fly . Flambeau turned abruptly at an exclamation behind him . It seemed to come from lower down than might have been expected , and to be addressed to his heels rather than his head . He instantly held out his hand , but he could hardly help laughing at what he saw . For some reason or other the platform had given way under Father Brown , and the unfortunate little man had dropped through to the level of the parade .
chesterton#"He was just tall enough , or short enough , for his head alone to stick out of the hole in the broken wood , looking like St John the Baptist ' s head on a charger . The face wore a disconcerted expression , as did , perhaps , that of St John the Baptist . In a moment he began to laugh a little . "" This wood must be rotten ,"" said Flambeau . "" Though it seems odd it should bear me , and you go through the weak place . Let me help you out ."""
chesterton#"But the little priest was looking rather curiously at the corners and edges of the wood alleged to be rotten , and there was a sort of trouble on his brow . "" Come along ,"" cried Flambeau impatiently , still with his big brown hand extended . "" Don ' t you want to get out ?"" The priest was holding a splinter of the broken wood between his finger and thumb , and did not immediately reply . At last he said thoughtfully : "" Want to get out ? Why , no ."
chesterton#"I rather think I want to get in ."" And he dived into the darkness under the wooden floor so abruptly as to knock off his big curved clerical hat and leave it lying on the boards above , without any clerical head in it . Flambeau looked once more inland and out to sea , and once more could see nothing but seas as wintry as the snow , and snows as level as the sea . There came a scurrying noise behind him , and the little priest came scrambling out of the hole faster than he had fallen in . His face was no longer disconcerted , but rather resolute , and , perhaps only through the reflections of the snow , a trifle paler than usual . "" Well ?"""
chesterton#"asked his tall friend . "" Have you found the god of the temple ?"" "" No ,"" answered Father Brown . "" I have found what was sometimes more important . The Sacrifice ."" "" What the devil do you mean ?"""
chesterton#"cried Flambeau , quite alarmed . Father Brown did not answer . He was staring , with a knot in his forehead , at the landscape ; and he suddenly pointed at it . "" What ' s that house over there ?"" he asked . Following his finger , Flambeau saw for the first time the corners of a building nearer than the farmhouse , but screened for the most part with a fringe of trees ."
chesterton#It was not a large building , and stood well back from the shore --, but a glint of ornament on it suggested that it was part of the same watering - place scheme of decoration as the bandstand , the little gardens and the curly - backed iron seats . Father Brown jumped off the bandstand , his friend following ; and as they walked in the direction indicated the trees fell away to right and left , and they saw a small , rather flashy hotel , such as is common in resorts -- the hotel of the Saloon Bar rather than the Bar Parlour . Almost the whole frontage was of gilt plaster and figured glass , and between that grey seascape and the grey , witch - like trees , its gimcrack quality had something spectral in its melancholy . They both felt vaguely that if any food or drink were offered at such a hostelry , it would be the paste - board ham and empty mug of the pantomime . In this , however , they were not altogether confirmed . As they drew nearer and nearer to the place they saw in front of the buffet , which was apparently closed , one of the iron garden - seats with curly backs that had adorned the gardens , but much longer , running almost the whole length of the frontage .
chesterton#"Presumably , it was placed so that visitors might sit there and look at the sea , but one hardly expected to find anyone doing it in such weather . Nevertheless , just in front of the extreme end of the iron seat stood a small round restaurant table , and on this stood a small bottle of Chablis and a plate of almonds and raisins . Behind the table and on the seat sat a dark - haired young man , bareheaded , and gazing at the sea in a state of almost astonishing immobility . But though he might have been a waxwork when they were within four yards of him , he jumped up like a jack - in - the - box when they came within three , and said in a deferential , though not undignified , manner : "" Will you step inside , gentlemen ? I have no staff at present , but I can get you anything simple myself ."" "" Much obliged ,"" said Flambeau ."
chesterton#""" So you are the proprietor ?"" "" Yes ,"" said the dark man , dropping back a little into his motionless manner . "" My waiters are all Italians , you see , and I thought it only fair they should see their countryman beat the black , if he really can do it . You know the great fight between Malvoli and Nigger Ned is coming off after all ?"" "" I ' m afraid we can ' t wait to trouble your hospitality seriously ,"" said Father Brown . "" But my friend would be glad of a glass of sherry , I ' m sure , to keep out the cold and drink success to the Latin champion ."""
chesterton#"Flambeau did not understand the sherry , but he did not object to it in the least . He could only say amiably : "" Oh , thank you very much ."" "" Sherry , sir -- certainly ,"" said their host , turning to his hostel . "" Excuse me if I detain you a few minutes . As I told you , I have no staff --"" And he went towards the black windows of his shuttered and unlighted inn . "" Oh , it doesn ' t really matter ,"" began Flambeau , but the man turned to reassure him ."
chesterton#""" I have the keys ,"" he said . "" I could find my way in the dark ."" "" I didn ' t mean --"" began Father Brown . He was interrupted by a bellowing human voice that came out of the bowels of the uninhabited hotel . It thundered some foreign name loudly but inaudibly , and the hotel proprietor moved more sharply towards it than he had done for Flambeau ' s sherry . As instant evidence proved , the proprietor had told , then and after , nothing but the literal truth ."
chesterton#"But both Flambeau and Father Brown have often confessed that , in all their ( often outrageous ) adventures , nothing had so chilled their blood as that voice of an ogre , sounding suddenly out of a silent and empty inn . "" My cook !"" cried the proprietor hastily . "" I had forgotten my cook . He will be starting presently . Sherry , sir ?"""
chesterton#"And , sure enough , there appeared in the doorway a big white bulk with white cap and white apron , as befits a cook , but with the needless emphasis of a black face . Flambeau had often heard that negroes made good cooks . But somehow something in the contrast of colour and caste increased his surprise that the hotel proprietor should answer the call of the cook , and not the cook the call of the proprietor . But he reflected that head cooks are proverbially arrogant ; and , besides , the host had come back with the sherry , and that was the great thing . "" I rather wonder ,"" said Father Brown , "" that there are so few people about the beach , when this big fight is coming on after all . We only met one man for miles ."""
chesterton#"The hotel proprietor shrugged his shoulders . "" They come from the other end of the town , you see -- from the station , three miles from here . They are only interested in the sport , and will stop in hotels for the night only . After all , it is hardly weather for basking on the shore ."" "" Or on the seat ,"" said Flambeau , and pointed to the little table . "" I have to keep a look - out ,"" said the man with the motionless face ."
chesterton#"He was a quiet , well - featured fellow , rather sallow ; his dark clothes had nothing distinctive about them , except that his black necktie was worn rather high , like a stock , and secured by a gold pin with some grotesque head to it . Nor was there anything notable in the face , except something that was probably a mere nervous trick -- a habit of opening one eye more narrowly than the other , giving the impression that the other was larger , or was , perhaps , artificial . The silence that ensued was broken by their host saying quietly : "" Whereabouts did you meet the one man on your march ?"" "" Curiously enough ,"" answered the priest , "" close by here -- just by that bandstand ."" Flambeau , who had sat on the long iron seat to finish his sherry , put it down and rose to his feet , staring at his friend in amazement . He opened his mouth to speak , and then shut it again ."
chesterton#""" Curious ,"" said the dark - haired man thoughtfully . "" What was he like ?"" "" It was rather dark when I saw him ,"" began Father Brown , "" but he was --"" As has been said , the hotel - keeper can be proved to have told the precise truth . His phrase that the cook was starting presently was fulfilled to the letter , for the cook came out , pulling his gloves on , even as they spoke . But he was a very different figure from the confused mass of white and black that had appeared for an instant in the doorway ."
chesterton#He was buttoned and buckled up to his bursting eyeballs in the most brilliant fashion . A tall black hat was tilted on his broad black head -- a hat of the sort that the French wit has compared to eight mirrors . But somehow the black man was like the black hat . He also was black , and yet his glossy skin flung back the light at eight angles or more . It is needless to say that he wore white spats and a white slip inside his waistcoat . The red flower stood up in his buttonhole aggressively , as if it had suddenly grown there .
chesterton#"And in the way he carried his cane in one hand and his cigar in the other there was a certain attitude -- an attitude we must always remember when we talk of racial prejudices : something innocent and insolent -- the cake walk . "" Sometimes ,"" said Flambeau , looking after him , "" I ' m not surprised that they lynch them ."" "" I am never surprised ,"" said Father Brown , "" at any work of hell . But as I was saying ,"" he resumed , as the negro , still ostentatiously pulling on his yellow gloves , betook himself briskly towards the watering - place , a queer music - hall figure against that grey and frosty scene --"" as I was saying , I couldn ' t describe the man very minutely , but he had a flourish and old - fashioned whiskers and moustachios , dark or dyed , as in the pictures of foreign financiers , round his neck was wrapped a long purple scarf that thrashed out in the wind as he walked . It was fixed at the throat rather in the way that nurses fix children ' s comforters with a safety - pin . Only this ,"" added the priest , gazing placidly out to sea , "" was not a safety - pin ."""
chesterton#"The man sitting on the long iron bench was also gazing placidly out to sea . Now he was once more in repose . Flambeau felt quite certain that one of his eyes was naturally larger than the other . Both were now well opened , and he could almost fancy the left eye grew larger as he gazed . "" It was a very long gold pin , and had the carved head of a monkey or some such thing ,"" continued the cleric ; "" and it was fixed in a rather odd way -- he wore pince - nez and a broad black --"" The motionless man continued to gaze at the sea , and the eyes in his head might have belonged to two different men ."
chesterton#Then he made a movement of blinding swiftness . Father Brown had his back to him , and in that flash might have fallen dead on his face . Flambeau had no weapon , but his large brown hands were resting on the end of the long iron seat . His shoulders abruptly altered their shape , and he heaved the whole huge thing high over his head , like a headsman ' s axe about to fall . The mere height of the thing , as he held it vertical , looked like a long iron ladder by which he was inviting men to climb towards the stars . But the long shadow , in the level evening light , looked like a giant brandishing the Eiffel Tower .
chesterton#"It was the shock of that shadow , before the shock of the iron crash , that made the stranger quail and dodge , and then dart into his inn , leaving the flat and shining dagger he had dropped exactly where it had fallen . "" We must get away from here instantly ,"" cried Flambeau , flinging the huge seat away with furious indifference on the beach . He caught the little priest by the elbow and ran him down a grey perspective of barren back garden , at the end of which there was a closed back garden door . Flambeau bent over it an instant in violent silence , and then said : "" The door is locked ."" As he spoke a black feather from one of the ornamental firs fell , brushing the brim of his hat . It startled him more than the small and distant detonation that had come just before ."
chesterton#Then came another distant detonation , and the door he was trying to open shook under the bullet buried in it . Flambeau ' s shoulders again filled out and altered suddenly . Three hinges and a lock burst at the same instant , and he went out into the empty path behind , carrying the great garden door with him , as Samson carried the gates of Gaza . Then he flung the garden door over the garden wall , just as a third shot picked up a spurt of snow and dust behind his heel . Without ceremony he snatched up the little priest , slung him astraddle on his shoulders , and went racing towards Seawood as fast as his long legs could carry him . It was not until nearly two miles farther on that he set his small companion down .
chesterton#"It had hardly been a dignified escape , in spite of the classic model of Anchises , but Father Brown ' s face only wore a broad grin . "" Well ,"" said Flambeau , after an impatient silence , as they resumed their more conventional tramp through the streets on the edge of the town , where no outrage need be feared , "" I don ' t know what all this means , but I take it I may trust my own eyes that you never met the man you have so accurately described ."" "" I did meet him in a way ,"" Brown said , biting his finger rather nervously --"" I did really . And it was too dark to see him properly , because it was under that bandstand affair . But I ' m afraid I didn ' t describe him so very accurately after all , for his pince - nez was broken under him , and the long gold pin wasn ' t stuck through his purple scarf but through his heart ."" "" And I suppose ,"" said the other in a lower voice , "" that glass - eyed guy had something to do with it ."""
chesterton#""" I had hoped he had only a little ,"" answered Brown in a rather troubled voice , "" and I may have been wrong in what I did . I acted on impulse . But I fear this business has deep roots and dark ."" They walked on through some streets in silence . The yellow lamps were beginning to be lit in the cold blue twilight , and they were evidently approaching the more central parts of the town . Highly coloured bills announcing the glove - fight between Nigger Ned and Malvoli were slapped about the walls ."
chesterton#""" Well ,"" said Flambeau , "" I never murdered anyone , even in my criminal days , but I can almost sympathize with anyone doing it in such a dreary place . Of all God - forsaken dustbins of Nature , I think the most heart - breaking are places like that bandstand , that were meant to be festive and are forlorn . I can fancy a morbid man feeling he must kill his rival in the solitude and irony of such a scene . I remember once taking a tramp in your glorious Surrey hills , thinking of nothing but gorse and skylarks , when I came out on a vast circle of land , and over me lifted a vast , voiceless structure , tier above tier of seats , as huge as a Roman amphitheatre and as empty as a new letter - rack . A bird sailed in heaven over it . It was the Grand Stand at Epsom ."
chesterton#"And I felt that no one would ever be happy there again ."" "" It ' s odd you should mention Epsom ,"" said the priest . "" Do you remember what was called the Sutton Mystery , because two suspected men -- ice - cream men , I think -- happened to live at Sutton ? They were eventually released . A man was found strangled , it was said , on the Downs round that part . As a fact , I know ( from an Irish policeman who is a friend of mine ) that he was found close up to the Epsom Grand Stand -- in fact , only hidden by one of the lower doors being pushed back ."""
chesterton#""" That is queer ,"" assented Flambeau . "" But it rather confirms my view that such pleasure places look awfully lonely out of season , or the man wouldn ' t have been murdered there ."" "" I ' m not so sure he --"" began Brown , and stopped . "" Not so sure he was murdered ?"" queried his companion . "" Not so sure he was murdered out of the season ,"" answered the little priest , with simplicity ."
chesterton#""" Don ' t you think there ' s something rather tricky about this solitude , Flambeau ? Do you feel sure a wise murderer would always want the spot to be lonely ? It ' s very , very seldom a man is quite alone . And , short of that , the more alone he is , the more certain he is to be seen . No ; I think there must be some other -- Why , here we are at the Pavilion or Palace , or whatever they call it ."" They had emerged on a small square , brilliantly lighted , of which the principal building was gay with gilding , gaudy with posters , and flanked with two giant photographs of Malvoli and Nigger Ned ."
chesterton#""" Hallo !"" cried Flambeau in great surprise , as his clerical friend stumped straight up the broad steps . "" I didn ' t know pugilism was your latest hobby . Are you going to see the fight ?"" "" I don ' t think there will be any fight ,"" replied Father Brown . They passed rapidly through ante - rooms and inner rooms ; they passed through the hall of combat itself , raised , roped , and padded with innumerable seats and boxes , and still the cleric did not look round or pause till he came to a clerk at a desk outside a door marked "" Committee ""."
chesterton#"There he stopped and asked to see Lord Pooley . The attendant observed that his lordship was very busy , as the fight was coming on soon , but Father Brown had a good - tempered tedium of reiteration for which the official mind is generally not prepared . In a few moments the rather baffled Flambeau found himself in the presence of a man who was still shouting directions to another man going out of the room . "" Be careful , you know , about the ropes after the fourth -- Well , and what do you want , I wonder !"" Lord Pooley was a gentleman , and , like most of the few remaining to our race , was worried -- especially about money . He was half grey and half flaxen , and he had the eyes of fever and a high - bridged , frost - bitten nose ."
chesterton#""" Only a word ,"" said Father Brown . "" I have come to prevent a man being killed ."" Lord Pooley bounded off his chair as if a spring had flung him from it . "" I ' m damned if I ' ll stand any more of this !"" he cried . "" You and your committees and parsons and petitions !"
chesterton#"Weren ' t there parsons in the old days , when they fought without gloves ? Now they ' re fighting with the regulation gloves , and there ' s not the rag of a possibility of either of the boxers being killed ."" "" I didn ' t mean either of the boxers ,"" said the little priest . "" Well , well , well !"" said the nobleman , with a touch of frosty humour . "" Who ' s going to be killed ?"
chesterton#"The referee ?"" "" I don ' t know who ' s going to be killed ,"" replied Father Brown , with a reflective stare . "" If I did I shouldn ' t have to spoil your pleasure . I could simply get him to escape . I never could see anything wrong about prize - fights . As it is , I must ask you to announce that the fight is off for the present ."""
chesterton#""" Anything else ?"" jeered the gentleman with feverish eyes . "" And what do you say to the two thousand people who have come to see it ?"" "" I say there will be one thousand nine - hundred and ninety - nine of them left alive when they have seen it ,"" said Father Brown . Lord Pooley looked at Flambeau . "" Is your friend mad ?"""
chesterton#"he asked . "" Far from it ,"" was the reply . "" And took here ,"" resumed Pooley in his restless way , "" it ' s worse than that . A whole pack of Italians have turned up to back Malvoli -- swarthy , savage fellows of some country , anyhow . You know what these Mediterranean races are like . If I send out word that it ' s off we shall have Malvoli storming in here at the head of a whole Corsican clan ."""
chesterton#""" My lord , it is a matter of life and death ,"" said the priest . "" Ring your bell . Give your message . And see whether it is Malvoli who answers ."" The nobleman struck the bell on the table with an odd air of new curiosity . He said to the clerk who appeared almost instantly in the doorway : "" I have a serious announcement to make to the audience shortly ."
chesterton#"Meanwhile , would you kindly tell the two champions that the fight will have to be put off ."" The clerk stared for some seconds as if at a demon and vanished . "" What authority have you for what you say ?"" asked Lord Pooley abruptly . "" Whom did you consult ?"" "" I consulted a bandstand ,"" said Father Brown , scratching his head ."
chesterton#""" But , no , I ' m wrong ; I consulted a book , too . I picked it up on a bookstall in London -- very cheap , too ."" He had taken out of his pocket a small , stout , leather - bound volume , and Flambeau , looking over his shoulder , could see that it was some book of old travels , and had a leaf turned down for reference . ""` The only form in which Voodoo --'"" began Father Brown , reading aloud . "" In which what ?"" inquired his lordship ."
chesterton#"""` In which Voodoo ,'"" repeated the reader , almost with relish , ""` is widely organized outside Jamaica itself is in the form known as the Monkey , or the God of the Gongs , which is powerful in many parts of the two American continents , especially among half - breeds , many of whom look exactly like white men . It differs from most other forms of devil - worship and human sacrifice in the fact that the blood is not shed formally on the altar , but by a sort of assassination among the crowd . The gongs beat with a deafening din as the doors of the shrine open and the monkey - god is revealed ; almost the whole congregation rivet ecstatic eyes on him . But after --'"" The door of the room was flung open , and the fashionable negro stood framed in it , his eyeballs rolling , his silk hat still insolently tilted on his head . "" Huh !"""
chesterton#"he cried , showing his apish teeth . "" What this ? Huh ! Huh ! You steal a coloured gentleman ' s prize -- prize his already -- yo ' think yo ' jes ' save that white ' Talian trash --"" "" The matter is only deferred ,"" said the nobleman quietly ."
chesterton#[ The Man Who Was Thursday by G . K . Chesterton 1908 ] To Edmund Clerihew Bentley A cloud was on the mind of men , and wailing went the weather , Yea , a sick cloud upon the soul when we were boys together . Science announced nonentity and art admired decay ; The world was old and ended : but you and I were gay ; Round us in antic order their crippled vices came -- Lust that had lost its laughter , fear that had lost its shame . Like the white lock of Whistler , that lit our aimless gloom , Men showed their own white feather as proudly as a plume . Life was a fly that faded , and death a drone that stung ; The world was very old indeed when you and I were young .
chesterton#They twisted even decent sin to shapes not to be named : Men were ashamed of honour ; but we were not ashamed . Weak if we were and foolish , not thus we failed , not thus ; When that black Baal blocked the heavens he had no hymns from us Children we were -- our forts of sand were even as weak as eve , High as they went we piled them up to break that bitter sea . Fools as we were in motley , all jangling and absurd , When all church bells were silent our cap and beds were heard . Not all unhelped we held the fort , our tiny flags unfurled ; Some giants laboured in that cloud to lift it from the world . I find again the book we found , I feel the hour that flings Far out of fish - shaped Paumanok some cry of cleaner things ; And the Green Carnation withered , as in forest fires that pass , Roared in the wind of all the world ten million leaves of grass ; Or sane and sweet and sudden as a bird sings in the rain -- Truth out of Tusitala spoke and pleasure out of pain . Yea , cool and clear and sudden as a bird sings in the grey , Dunedin to Samoa spoke , and darkness unto day .
chesterton#But we were young ; we lived to see God break their bitter charms . God and the good Republic come riding back in arms : We have seen the City of Mansoul , even as it rocked , relieved -- Blessed are they who did not see , but being blind , believed . This is a tale of those old fears , even of those emptied hells , And none but you shall understand the true thing that it tells -- Of what colossal gods of shame could cow men and yet crash , Of what huge devils hid the stars , yet fell at a pistol flash . The doubts that were so plain to chase , so dreadful to withstand -- Oh , who shall understand but you ; yea , who shall understand ? The doubts that drove us through the night as we two talked amain , And day had broken on the streets e ' er it broke upon the brain . Between us , by the peace of God , such truth can now be told ; Yea , there is strength in striking root and good in growing old .
chesterton#We have found common things at last and marriage and a creed , And I may safely write it now , and you may safely read . G . K . C . CHAPTER I THE TWO POETS OF SAFFRON PARK THE suburb of Saffron Park lay on the sunset side of London , as red and ragged as a cloud of sunset . It was built of a bright brick throughout ; its sky - line was fantastic , and even its ground plan was wild .
chesterton#It had been the outburst of a speculative builder , faintly tinged with art , who called its architecture sometimes Elizabethan and sometimes Queen Anne , apparently under the impression that the two sovereigns were identical . It was described with some justice as an artistic colony , though it never in any definable way produced any art . But although its pretensions to be an intellectual centre were a little vague , its pretensions to be a pleasant place were quite indisputable . The stranger who looked for the first time at the quaint red houses could only think how very oddly shaped the people must be who could fit in to them . Nor when he met the people was he disappointed in this respect . The place was not only pleasant , but perfect , if once he could regard it not as a deception but rather as a dream .
chesterton#"Even if the people were not "" artists ,"" the whole was nevertheless artistic . That young man with the long , auburn hair and the impudent face -- that young man was not really a poet ; but surely he was a poem . That old gentleman with the wild , white beard and the wild , white hat -- that venerable humbug was not really a philosopher ; but at least he was the cause of philosophy in others . That scientific gentleman with the bald , egg - like head and the bare , bird - like neck had no real right to the airs of science that he assumed . He had not discovered anything new in biology ; but what biological creature could he have discovered more singular than himself ? Thus , and thus only , the whole place had properly to be regarded ; it had to be considered not so much as a workshop for artists , but as a frail but finished work of art ."
chesterton#A man who stepped into its social atmosphere felt as if he had stepped into a written comedy . More especially this attractive unreality fell upon it about nightfall , when the extravagant roofs were dark against the afterglow and the whole insane village seemed as separate as a drifting cloud . This again was more strongly true of the many nights of local festivity , when the little gardens were often illuminated , and the big Chinese lanterns glowed in the dwarfish trees like some fierce and monstrous fruit . And this was strongest of all on one particular evening , still vaguely remembered in the locality , of which the auburn - haired poet was the hero . It was not by any means the only evening of which he was the hero . On many nights those passing by his little back garden might hear his high , didactic voice laying down the law to men and particularly to women .
chesterton#The attitude of women in such cases was indeed one of the paradoxes of the place . Most of the women were of the kind vaguely called emancipated , and professed some protest against male supremacy . Yet these new women would always pay to a man the extravagant compliment which no ordinary woman ever pays to him , that of listening while he is talking . And Mr . Lucian Gregory , the red - haired poet , was really ( in some sense ) a man worth listening to , even if one only laughed at the end of it . He put the old cant of the lawlessness of art and the art of lawlessness with a certain impudent freshness which gave at least a momentary pleasure . He was helped in some degree by the arresting oddity of his appearance , which he worked , as the phrase goes , for all it was worth .
chesterton#His dark red hair parted in the middle was literally like a woman ' s , and curved into the slow curls of a virgin in a pre - Raphaelite picture . From within this almost saintly oval , however , his face projected suddenly broad and brutal , the chin carried forward with a look of cockney contempt . This combination at once tickled and terrified the nerves of a neurotic population . He seemed like a walking blasphemy , a blend of the angel and the ape . This particular evening , if it is remembered for nothing else , will be remembered in that place for its strange sunset . It looked like the end of the world .
chesterton#All the heaven seemed covered with a quite vivid and palpable plumage ; you could only say that the sky was full of feathers , and of feathers that almost brushed the face . Across the great part of the dome they were grey , with the strangest tints of violet and mauve and an unnatural pink or pale green ; but towards the west the whole grew past description , transparent and passionate , and the last red - hot plumes of it covered up the sun like something too good to be seen . The whole was so close about the earth , as to express nothing but a violent secrecy . The very empyrean seemed to be a secret . It expressed that splendid smallness which is the soul of local patriotism . The very sky seemed small .
chesterton#I say that there are some inhabitants who may remember the evening if only by that oppressive sky . There are others who may remember it because it marked the first appearance in the place of the second poet of Saffron Park . For a long time the red - haired revolutionary had reigned without a rival ; it was upon the night of the sunset that his solitude suddenly ended . The new poet , who introduced himself by the name of Gabriel Syme was a very mild - looking mortal , with a fair , pointed beard and faint , yellow hair . But an impression grew that he was less meek than he looked . He signalised his entrance by differing with the established poet , Gregory , upon the whole nature of poetry .
chesterton#"He said that he ( Syme ) was poet of law , a poet of order ; nay , he said he was a poet of respectability . So all the Saffron Parkers looked at him as if he had that moment fallen out of that impossible sky . In fact , Mr . Lucian Gregory , the anarchic poet , connected the two events . "" It may well be ,"" he said , in his sudden lyrical manner , "" it may well be on such a night of clouds and cruel colours that there is brought forth upon the earth such a portent as a respectable poet . You say you are a poet of law ; I say you are a contradiction in terms . I only wonder there were not comets and earthquakes on the night you appeared in this garden ."""
chesterton#"The man with the meek blue eyes and the pale , pointed beard endured these thunders with a certain submissive solemnity . The third party of the group , Gregory ' s sister Rosamond , who had her brother ' s braids of red hair , but a kindlier face underneath them , laughed with such mixture of admiration and disapproval as she gave commonly to the family oracle . Gregory resumed in high oratorical good humour . "" An artist is identical with an anarchist ,"" he cried . "" You might transpose the words anywhere . An anarchist is an artist ."
chesterton#"The man who throws a bomb is an artist , because he prefers a great moment to everything . He sees how much more valuable is one burst of blazing light , one peal of perfect thunder , than the mere common bodies of a few shapeless policemen . An artist disregards all governments , abolishes all conventions . The poet delights in disorder only . If it were not so , the most poetical thing in the world would be the Underground Railway ."" "" So it is ,"" said Mr . Syme ."
chesterton#""" Nonsense !"" said Gregory , who was very rational when anyone else attempted paradox . "" Why do all the clerks and navvies in the railway trains look so sad and tired , so very sad and tired ? I will tell you . It is because they know that the train is going right . It is because they know that whatever place they have taken a ticket for that place they will reach ."
chesterton#"It is because after they have passed Sloane Square they know that the next station must be Victoria , and nothing but Victoria . Oh , their wild rapture ! oh , their eyes like stars and their souls again in Eden , if the next station were unaccountably Baker Street !"" "" It is you who are unpoetical ,"" replied the poet Syme . "" If what you say of clerks is true , they can only be as prosaic as your poetry . The rare , strange thing is to hit the mark ; the gross , obvious thing is to miss it ."
chesterton#We feel it is epical when man with one wild arrow strikes a distant bird . Is it not also epical when man with one wild engine strikes a distant station ? Chaos is dull ; because in chaos the train might indeed go anywhere , to Baker Street or to Bagdad . But man is a magician , and his whole magic is in this , that he does say Victoria , and lo ! it is Victoria . No , take your books of mere poetry and prose ; let me read a time table , with tears of pride .
chesterton#"Take your Byron , who commemorates the defeats of man ; give me Bradshaw , who commemorates his victories . Give me Bradshaw , I say !"" "" Must you go ?"" inquired Gregory sarcastically . "" I tell you ,"" went on Syme with passion , "" that every time a train comes in I feel that it has broken past batteries of besiegers , and that man has won a battle against chaos . You say contemptuously that when one has left Sloane Square one must come to Victoria ."
chesterton#"I say that one might do a thousand things instead , and that whenever I really come there I have the sense of hairbreadth escape . And when I hear the guard shout out the word ' Victoria ,' it is not an unmeaning word . It is to me the cry of a herald announcing conquest . It is to me indeed ' Victoria '; it is the victory of Adam ."" Gregory wagged his heavy , red head with a slow and sad smile . "" And even then ,"" he said , "" we poets always ask the question , ' And what is Victoria now that you have got there ?'"
chesterton#"You think Victoria is like the New Jerusalem . We know that the New Jerusalem will only be like Victoria . Yes , the poet will be discontented even in the streets of heaven . The poet is always in revolt ."" "" There again ,"" said Syme irritably , "" what is there poetical about being in revolt ? You might as well say that it is poetical to be sea - sick ."
chesterton#"Being sick is a revolt . Both being sick and being rebellious may be the wholesome thing on certain desperate occasions ; but I ' m hanged if I can see why they are poetical . Revolt in the abstract is -- revolting . It ' s mere vomiting ."" The girl winced for a flash at the unpleasant word , but Syme was too hot to heed her . "" It is things going right ,"" he cried , "" that is poetical I Our digestions , for instance , going sacredly and silently right , that is the foundation of all poetry ."
chesterton#"Yes , the most poetical thing , more poetical than the flowers , more poetical than the stars -- the most poetical thing in the world is not being sick ."" "" Really ,"" said Gregory superciliously , "" the examples you choose --"" "" I beg your pardon ,"" said Syme grimly , "" I forgot we had abolished all conventions ."" For the first time a red patch appeared on Gregory ' s forehead . "" You don ' t expect me ,"" he said , "" to revolutionise society on this lawn ?"" Syme looked straight into his eyes and smiled sweetly ."
chesterton#""" No , I don ' t ,"" he said ; "" but I suppose that if you were serious about your anarchism , that is exactly what you would do ."" Gregory ' s big bull ' s eyes blinked suddenly like those of an angry lion , and one could almost fancy that his red mane rose . "" Don ' t you think , then ,"" he said in a dangerous voice , "" that I am serious about my anarchism ?"" "" I beg your pardon ?"" said Syme . "" Am I not serious about my anarchism ?"""
chesterton#"cried Gregory , with knotted fists . "" My dear fellow !"" said Syme , and strolled away . With surprise , but with a curious pleasure , he found Rosamond Gregory still in his company . "" Mr . Syme ,"" she said , "" do the people who talk like you and my brother often mean what they say ? Do you mean what you say now ?"""
chesterton#"Syme smiled . "" Do you ?"" he asked . "" What do you mean ?"" asked the girl , with grave eyes . "" My dear Miss Gregory ,"" said Syme gently , "" there are many kinds of sincerity and insincerity ."
chesterton#When you say ' thank you ' for the salt , do you mean what you say ? No . When you say ' the world is round ,' do you mean what you say ? No . It is true , but you don ' t mean it . Now , sometimes a man like your brother really finds a thing he does mean .
chesterton#"It may be only a half - truth , quarter - truth , tenth - truth ; but then he says more than he means -- from sheer force of meaning it ."" She was looking at him from under level brows ; her face was grave and open , and there had fallen upon it the shadow of that unreasoning responsibility which is at the bottom of the most frivolous woman , the maternal watch which is as old as the world . "" Is he really an anarchist , then ?"" she asked . "" Only in that sense I speak of ,"" replied Syme ; "" or if you prefer it , in that nonsense ."" She drew her broad brows together and said abruptly --"
chesterton#""" He wouldn ' t really use -- bombs or that sort of thing ?"" Syme broke into a great laugh , that seemed too large for his slight and somewhat dandified figure . "" Good Lord , no !"" he said , "" that has to be done anonymously ."" And at that the corners of her own mouth broke into a smile , and she thought with a simultaneous pleasure of Gregory ' s absurdity and of his safety . Syme strolled with her to a seat in the corner of the garden , and continued to pour out his opinions ."
chesterton#For he was a sincere man , and in spite of his superficial airs and graces , at root a humble one . And it is always the humble man who talks too much ; the proud man watches himself too closely . He defended respectability with violence and exaggeration . He grew passionate in his praise of tidiness and propriety . All the time there was a smell of lilac all round him . Once he heard very faintly in some distant street a barrel - organ begin to play , and it seemed to him that his heroic words were moving to a tiny tune from under or beyond the world .
chesterton#He stared and talked at the girl ' s red hair and amused face for what seemed to be a few minutes ; and then , feeling that the groups in such a place should mix , rose to his feet . To his astonishment , he discovered the whole garden empty . Everyone had gone long ago , and he went himself with a rather hurried apology . He left with a sense of champagne in his head , which he could not afterwards explain . In the wild events which were to follow this girl had no part at all ; he never saw her again until all his tale was over . And yet , in some indescribable way , she kept recurring like a motive in music through all his mad adventures afterwards , and the glory of her strange hair ran like a red thread through those dark and ill - drawn tapestries of the night .
chesterton#For what followed was so improbable , that it might well have been a dream . When Syme went out into the starlit street , he found it for the moment empty . Then he realised ( in some odd way ) that the silence was rather a living silence than a dead one . Directly outside the door stood a street lamp , whose gleam gilded the leaves of the tree that bent out over the fence behind him . About a foot from the lamp - post stood a figure almost as rigid and motionless as the lamp - post itself . The tall hat and long frock coat were black ; the face , in an abrupt shadow , was almost as dark .
chesterton#"Only a fringe of fiery hair against the light , and also something aggressive in the attitude , proclaimed that it was the poet Gregory . He had something of the look of a masked bravo waiting sword in hand for his foe . He made a sort of doubtful salute , which Syme somewhat more formally returned . "" I was waiting for you ,"" said Gregory . "" Might I have a moment ' s conversation ?"" "" Certainly ."
chesterton#"About what ?"" asked Syme in a sort of weak wonder . Gregory struck out with his stick at the lamp - post , and then at the tree . "" About this and this ,"" he cried ; "" about order and anarchy . There is your precious order , that lean , iron lamp , ugly and barren ; and there is anarchy , rich , living , reproducing itself -- there is anarchy , splendid in green and gold ."" "" All the same ,"" replied Syme patiently , "" just at present you only see the tree by the light of the lamp ."
chesterton#"I wonder when you would ever see the lamp by the light of the tree ."" Then after a pause he said , "" But may I ask if you have been standing out here in the dark only to resume our little argument ?"" "" No ,"" cried out Gregory , in a voice that rang down the street , "" I did not stand here to resume our argument , but to end it for ever ."" The silence fell again , and Syme , though he understood nothing , listened instinctively for something serious . Gregory began in a smooth voice and with a rather bewildering smile . "" Mr . Syme ,"" he said , "" this evening you succeeded in doing something rather remarkable ."
chesterton#"You did something to me that no man born of woman has ever succeeded in doing before ."" "" Indeed !"" "" Now I remember ,"" resumed Gregory reflectively , "" one other person succeeded in doing it . The captain of a penny steamer ( if I remember correctly ) at Southend . You have irritated me ."" "" I am very sorry ,"" replied Syme with gravity ."
chesterton#""" I am afraid my fury and your insult are too shocking to be wiped out even with an apology ,"" said Gregory very calmly . "" No duel could wipe it out . If I struck you dead I could not wipe it out . There is only one way by which that insult can be erased , and that way I choose . I am going , at the possible sacrifice of my life and honour , to prove to you that you were wrong in what you said ."" "" In what I said ?"""
chesterton#""" You said I was not serious about being an anarchist ."" "" There are degrees of seriousness ,"" replied Syme . "" I have never doubted that you were perfectly sincere in this sense , that you thought what you said well worth saying , that you thought a paradox might wake men up to a neglected truth ."" Gregory stared at him steadily and painfully . "" And in no other sense ,"" he asked , "" you think me serious ? You think me a flaneur who lets fall occasional truths ."
chesterton#"You do not think that in a deeper , a more deadly sense , I am serious ."" Syme struck his stick violently on the stones of the road . "" Serious !"" he cried . "" Good Lord ! is this street serious ?"
chesterton#"Are these damned Chinese lanterns serious ? Is the whole caboodle serious ? One comes here and talks a pack of bosh , and perhaps some sense as well , but I should think very little of a man who didn ' t keep something in the background of his life that was more serious than all this talking -- something more serious , whether it was religion or only drink ."" "" Very well ,"" said Gregory , his face darkening , "" you shall see something more serious than either drink or religion ."" Syme stood waiting with his usual air of mildness until Gregory again opened his lips . "" You spoke just now of having a religion ."
chesterton#"Is it really true that you have one ?"" "" Oh ,"" said Syme with a beaming smile , "" we are all Catholics now ."" "" Then may I ask you to swear by whatever gods or saints your religion involves that you will not reveal what I am now going to tell you to any son of Adam , and especially not to the police ? Will you swear that ! If you will take upon yourself this awful abnegations if you will consent to burden your soul with a vow that you should never make and a knowledge you should never dream about , I will promise you in return --"" "" You will promise me in return ?"""
chesterton#"inquired Syme , as the other paused . "" I will promise you a very entertaining evening ."" Syme suddenly took off his hat . "" Your offer ,"" he said , "" is far too idiotic to be declined . You say that a poet is always an anarchist . I disagree ; but I hope at least that he is always a sportsman ."
chesterton#"Permit me , here and now , to swear as a Christian , and promise as a good comrade and a fellow - artist , that I will not report anything of this , whatever it is , to the police . And now , in the name of Colney Hatch , what is it ?"" "" I think ,"" said Gregory , with placid irrelevancy , "" that we will call a cab ."" He gave two long whistles , and a hansom came rattling down the road . The two got into it in silence . Gregory gave through the trap the address of an obscure public - house on the Chiswick bank of the river ."
chesterton#The cab whisked itself away again , and in it these two fantastics quitted their fantastic town . CHAPTER II THE SECRET OF GABRIEL SYME THE cab pulled up before a particularly dreary and greasy beershop , into which Gregory rapidly conducted his companion . They seated themselves in a close and dim sort of bar - parlour , at a stained wooden table with one wooden leg . The room was so small and dark , that very little could be seen of the attendant who was summoned , beyond a vague and dark impression of something bulky and bearded .
chesterton#""" Will you take a little supper ?"" asked Gregory politely . "" The pate de foie gras is not good here , but I can recommend the game ."" Syme received the remark with stolidity , imagining it to be a joke . Accepting the vein of humour , he said , with a well - bred indifference -- "" Oh , bring me some lobster mayonnaise ."""
chesterton#"To his indescribable astonishment , the man only said "" Certainly , sir !"" and went away apparently to get it . "" What will you drink ?"" resumed Gregory , with the same careless yet apologetic air . "" I shall only have a crepe de menthe myself ; I have dined . But the champagne can really be trusted ."
chesterton#"Do let me start you with a half - bottle of Pommery at least ?"" "" Thank you !"" said the motionless Syme . "" You are very good ."" His further attempts at conversation , somewhat disorganised in themselves , were cut short finally as by a thunderbolt by the actual appearance of the lobster . Syme tasted it , and found it particularly good ."
chesterton#"Then he suddenly began to eat with great rapidity and appetite . "" Excuse me if I enjoy myself rather obviously !"" he said to Gregory , smiling . "" I don ' t often have the luck to have a dream like this . It is new to me for a nightmare to lead to a lobster . It is commonly the other way ."""
chesterton#""" You are not asleep , I assure you ,"" said Gregory . "" You are , on the contrary , close to the most actual and rousing moment of your existence . Ah , here comes your champagne ! I admit that there may be a slight disproportion , let us say , between the inner arrangements of this excellent hotel and its simple and unpretentious exterior . But that is all our modesty . We are the most modest men that ever lived on earth ."""
chesterton#""" And who are we ?"" asked Syme , emptying his champagne glass . "" It is quite simple ,"" replied Gregory . "" We are the serious anarchists , in whom you do not believe ."" "" Oh !"" said Syme shortly ."
chesterton#""" You do yourselves well in drinks ."" "" Yes , we are serious about everything ,"" answered Gregory . Then after a pause he added -- "" If in a few moments this table begins to turn round a little , don ' t put it down to your inroads into the champagne . I don ' t wish you to do yourself an injustice ."" "" Well , if I am not drunk , I am mad ,"" replied Syme with perfect calm ; "" but I trust I can behave like a gentleman in either condition ."
chesterton#"May I smoke ?"" "" Certainly !"" said Gregory , producing a cigar - case . "" Try one of mine ."" Syme took the cigar , clipped the end off with a cigar - cutter out of his waistcoat pocket , put it in his mouth , lit it slowly , and let out a long cloud of smoke . It is not a little to his credit that he performed these rites with so much composure , for almost before he had begun them the table at which he sat had begun to revolve , first slowly , and then rapidly , as if at an insane seance ."
chesterton#""" You must not mind it ,"" said Gregory ; "" it ' s a kind of screw ."" "" Quite so ,"" said Syme placidly , "" a kind of screw . How simple that is !"" The next moment the smoke of his cigar , which had been wavering across the room in snaky twists , went straight up as if from a factory chimney , and the two , with their chairs and table , shot down through the floor as if the earth had swallowed them . They went rattling down a kind of roaring chimney as rapidly as a lift cut loose , and they came with an abrupt bump to the bottom . But when Gregory threw open a pair of doors and let in a red subterranean light , Syme was still smoking with one leg thrown over the other , and had not turned a yellow hair ."
chesterton#"Gregory led him down a low , vaulted passage , at the end of which was the red light . It was an enormous crimson lantern , nearly as big as a fireplace , fixed over a small but heavy iron door . In the door there was a sort of hatchway or grating , and on this Gregory struck five times . A heavy voice with a foreign accent asked him who he was . To this he gave the more or less unexpected reply , "" Mr . Joseph Chamberlain ."" The heavy hinges began to move ; it was obviously some kind of password ."
chesterton#"Inside the doorway the passage gleamed as if it were lined with a network of steel . On a second glance , Syme saw that the glittering pattern was really made up of ranks and ranks of rifles and revolvers , closely packed or interlocked . "" I must ask you to forgive me all these formalities ,"" said Gregory ; "" we have to be very strict here ."" "" Oh , don ' t apologise ,"" said Syme . "" I know your passion for law and order ,"" and he stepped into the passage lined with the steel weapons . With his long , fair hair and rather foppish frock - coat , he looked a singularly frail and fanciful figure as he walked down that shining avenue of death ."
chesterton#"They passed through several such passages , and came out at last into a queer steel chamber with curved walls , almost spherical in shape , but presenting , with its tiers of benches , something of the appearance of a scientific lecture - theatre . There were no rifles or pistols in this apartment , but round the walls of it were hung more dubious and dreadful shapes , things that looked like the bulbs of iron plants , or the eggs of iron birds . They were bombs , and the very room itself seemed like the inside of a bomb . Syme knocked his cigar ash off against the wall , and went in . "" And now , my dear Mr . Syme ,"" said Gregory , throwing himself in an expansive manner on the bench under the largest bomb , "" now we are quite cosy , so let us talk properly . Now no human words can give you any notion of why I brought you here ."
chesterton#"It was one of those quite arbitrary emotions , like jumping off a cliff or falling in love . Suffice it to say that you were an inexpressibly irritating fellow , and , to do you justice , you are still . I would break twenty oaths of secrecy for the pleasure of taking you down a peg . That way you have of lighting a cigar would make a priest break the seal of confession . Well , you said that you were quite certain I was not a serious anarchist . Does this place strike you as being serious ?"""
chesterton#""" It does seem to have a moral under all its gaiety ,"" assented Syme ; "" but may I ask you two questions ? You need not fear to give me information , because , as you remember , you very wisely extorted from me a promise not to tell the police , a promise I shall certainly keep . So it is in mere curiosity that I make my queries . First of all , what is it really all about ? What is it you object to ? You want to abolish Government ?"""
chesterton#""" To abolish God !"" said Gregory , opening the eyes of a fanatic . "" We do not only want to upset a few despotisms and police regulations ; that sort of anarchism does exist , but it is a mere branch of the Nonconformists . We dig deeper and we blow you higher . We wish to deny all those arbitrary distinctions of vice and virtue , honour and treachery , upon which mere rebels base themselves . The silly sentimentalists of the French Revolution talked of the Rights of Man !"
chesterton#"We hate Rights as we hate Wrongs . We have abolished Right and Wrong ."" "" And Right and Left ,"" said Syme with a simple eagerness , "" I hope you will abolish them too . They are much more troublesome to me ."" "" You spoke of a second question ,"" snapped Gregory . "" With pleasure ,"" resumed Syme ."
chesterton#""" In all your present acts and surroundings there is a scientific attempt at secrecy . I have an aunt who lived over a shop , but this is the first time I have found people living from preference under a public - house . You have a heavy iron door . You cannot pass it without submitting to the humiliation of calling yourself Mr . Chamberlain . You surround yourself with steel instruments which make the place , if I may say so , more impressive than homelike . May I ask why , after taking all this trouble to barricade yourselves in the bowels of the earth , you then parade your whole secret by talking about anarchism to every silly woman in Saffron Park ?"""
chesterton#"Gregory smiled . "" The answer is simple ,"" he said . "" I told you I was a serious anarchist , and you did not believe me . Nor do they believe me . Unless I took them into this infernal room they would not believe me ."" Syme smoked thoughtfully , and looked at him with interest ."
chesterton#"Gregory went on . "" The history of the thing might amuse you ,"" he said . "" When first I became one of the New Anarchists I tried all kinds of respectable disguises . I dressed up as a bishop . I read up all about bishops in our anarchist pamphlets , in Superstition the Vampire and Priests of Prey . I certainly understood from them that bishops are strange and terrible old men keeping a cruel secret from mankind ."
chesterton#I was misinformed . When on my first appearing in episcopal gaiters in a drawing - room I cried out in a voice of thunder , ' Down ! down ! presumptuous human reason !' they found out in some way that I was not a bishop at all . I was nabbed at once .
chesterton#Then I made up as a millionaire ; but I defended Capital with so much intelligence that a fool could see that I was quite poor . Then I tried being a major . Now I am a humanitarian myself , but I have , I hope , enough intellectual breadth to understand the position of those who , like Nietzsche , admire violence -- the proud , mad war of Nature and all that , you know . I threw myself into the major . I drew my sword and waved it constantly . I called out ' Blood !'
chesterton#"abstractedly , like a man calling for wine . I often said , ' Let the weak perish ; it is the Law .' Well , well , it seems majors don ' t do this . I was nabbed again . At last I went in despair to the President of the Central Anarchist Council , who is the greatest man in Europe ."" "" What is his name ?"""
chesterton#"asked Syme . "" You would not know it ,"" answered Gregory . "" That is his greatness . Caesar and Napoleon put all their genius into being heard of , and they were heard of . He puts all his genius into not being heard of , and he is not heard of . But you cannot be for five minutes in the room with him without feeling that Caesar and Napoleon would have been children in his hands ."""
chesterton#"He was silent and even pale for a moment , and then resumed -- "" But whenever he gives advice it is always something as startling as an epigram , and yet as practical as the Bank of England . I said to him , ' What disguise will hide me from the world ? What can I find more respectable than bishops and majors ?' He looked at me with his large but indecipherable face . ' You want a safe disguise , do you ?"
chesterton#You want a dress which will guarantee you harmless ; a dress in which no one would ever look for a bomb ?' I nodded . He suddenly lifted his lion ' s voice . ' Why , then , dress up as an anarchist , you fool !' he roared so that the room shook . ' Nobody will ever expect you to do anything dangerous then .'
chesterton#"And he turned his broad back on me without another word . I took his advice , and have never regretted it . I preached blood and murder to those women day and night , and -- by God !-- they would let me wheel their perambulators ."" Syme sat watching him with some respect in his large , blue eyes . "" You took me in ,"" he said . "" It is really a smart dodge ."""
chesterton#"Then after a pause he added -- "" What do you call this tremendous President of yours ?"" "" We generally call him Sunday ,"" replied Gregory with simplicity . ' You see , there are seven members of the Central Anarchist Council , and they are named after days of the week . He is called Sunday , by some of his admirers Bloody Sunday . It is curious you should mention the matter , because the very night you have dropped in ( if I may so express it ) is the night on which our London branch , which assembles in this room , has to elect its own deputy to fill a vacancy in the Council ."
chesterton#"The gentleman who has for some time past played , with propriety and general applause , the difficult part of Thursday , has died quite suddenly . Consequently , we have called a meeting this very evening to elect a successor ."" He got to his feet and strolled across the room with a sort of smiling embarrassment . "" I feel somehow as if you were my mother , Syme ,"" he continued casually . "" I feel that I can confide anything to you , as you have promised to tell nobody . In fact , I will confide to you something that I would not say in so many words to the anarchists who will be coming to the room in about ten minutes ."
chesterton#"We shall , of course , go through a form of election ; but I don ' t mind telling you that it is practically certain what the result will be ."" He looked down for a moment modestly . "" It is almost a settled thing that I am to be Thursday ."" "" My dear fellow ."" said Syme heartily , "" I congratulate you . A great career !"""
chesterton#"Gregory smiled in deprecation , and walked across the room , talking rapidly . "" As a matter of fact , everything is ready for me on this table ,"" he said , "" and the ceremony will probably be the shortest possible ."" Syme also strolled across to the table , and found lying across it a walking - stick , which turned out on examination to be a sword - stick , a large Colt ' s revolver , a sandwich case , and a formidable flask of brandy . Over the chair , beside the table , was thrown a heavy - looking cape or cloak . "" I have only to get the form of election finished ,"" continued Gregory with animation , "" then I snatch up this cloak and stick , stuff these other things into my pocket , step out of a door in this cavern , which opens on the river , where there is a steam - tug already waiting for me , and then -- then -- oh , the wild joy of being Thursday !"" And he clasped his hands ."
chesterton#"Syme , who had sat down once more with his usual insolent languor , got to his feet with an unusual air of hesitation . "" Why is it ,"" he asked vaguely , "" that I think you are quite a decent fellow ? Why do I positively like you , Gregory ?"" He paused a moment , and then added with a sort of fresh curiosity , "" Is it because you are such an ass ?"" There was a thoughtful silence again , and then he cried out -- "" Well , damn it all !"
chesterton#"this is the funniest situation I have ever been in in my life , and I am going to act accordingly . Gregory , I gave you a promise before I came into this place . That promise I would keep under red - hot pincers . Would you give me , for my own safety , a little promise of the same kind ? "" "" A promise ?"" asked Gregory , wondering ."
chesterton#""" Yes ,"" said Syme very seriously , "" a promise . I swore before God that I would not tell your secret to the police . Will you swear by Humanity , or whatever beastly thing you believe in , that you will not tell my secret to the anarchists ?"" "" Your secret ?"" asked the staring Gregory . "" Have you got a secret ?"""
chesterton#""" Yes ,"" said Syme , "" I have a secret ."" Then after a pause , "" Will you swear ?"" Gregory glared at him gravely for a few moments , and then said abruptly -- "" You must have bewitched me , but I feel a furious curiosity about you . Yes , I will swear not to tell the anarchists anything you tell me . But look sharp , for they will be here in a couple of minutes ."""
chesterton#"Syme rose slowly to his feet and thrust his long , white hands into his long , grey trousers ' pockets . Almost as he did so there came five knocks on the outer grating , proclaiming the arrival of the first of the conspirators . "" Well ,"" said Syme slowly , "" I don ' t know how to tell you the truth more shortly than by saying that your expedient of dressing up as an aimless poet is not confined to you or your President . We have known the dodge for some time at Scotland Yard ."" Gregory tried to spring up straight , but he swayed thrice . "" What do you say ?"""
chesterton#"he asked in an inhuman voice . "" Yes ,"" said Syme simply , "" I am a police detective . But I think I hear your friends coming ."" From the doorway there came a murmur of "" Mr . Joseph Chamberlain ."" It was repeated twice and thrice , and then thirty times , and the crowd of Joseph Chamberlains ( a solemn thought ) could be heard trampling down the corridor . CHAPTER III"
chesterton#"THE MAN WHO WAS THURSDAY BEFORE one of the fresh faces could appear at the doorway , Gregory ' s stunned surprise had fallen from him . He was beside the table with a bound , and a noise in his throat like a wild beast . He caught up the Colt ' s revolver and took aim at Syme . Syme did not flinch , but he put up a pale and polite hand . "" Don ' t be such a silly man ,"" he said , with the effeminate dignity of a curate ."
chesterton#""" Don ' t you see it ' s not necessary ? Don ' t you see that we ' re both in the same boat ? Yes , and jolly sea - sick ."" Gregory could not speak , but he could not fire either , and he looked his question . "" Don ' t you see we ' ve checkmated each other ?"" cried Syme ."
chesterton#""" I can ' t tell the police you are an anarchist . You can ' t tell the anarchists I ' m a policeman . I can only watch you , knowing what you are ; you can only watch me , knowing what I am . In short , it ' s a lonely , intellectual duel , my head against yours . I ' m a policeman deprived of the help of the police . You , my poor fellow , are an anarchist deprived of the help of that law and organisation which is so essential to anarchy ."
chesterton#"The one solitary difference is in your favour . You are not surrounded by inquisitive policemen ; I am surrounded by inquisitive anarchists . I cannot betray you , but I might betray myself . Come , come ! wait and see me betray myself . I shall do it so nicely ."""
chesterton#"Gregory put the pistol slowly down , still staring at Syme as if he were a sea - monster . "" I don ' t believe in immortality ,"" he said at last , "" but if , after all this , you were to break your word , God would make a hell only for you , to howl in for ever ."" "" I shall not break my word ,"" said Syme sternly , "" nor will you break yours . Here are your friends ."" The mass of the anarchists entered the room heavily , with a slouching and somewhat weary gait ; but one little man , with a black beard and glasses -- a man somewhat of the type of Mr . Tim Healy -- detached himself , and bustled forward with some papers in his hand . "" Comrade Gregory ,"" he said , "" I suppose this man is a delegate ?"""
chesterton#"Gregory , taken by surprise , looked down and muttered the name of Syme ; but Syme replied almost pertly -- "" I am glad to see that your gate is well enough guarded to make it hard for anyone to be here who was not a delegate ."" The brow of the little man with the black beard was , however , still contracted with something like suspicion . "" What branch do you represent ?"" he asked sharply . "" I should hardly call it a branch ,"" said Syme , laughing ; "" I should call it at the very least a root ."""
chesterton#""" What do you mean ?"" "" The fact is ,"" said Syme serenely , "" the truth is I am a Sabbatarian . I have been specially sent here to see that you show a due observance of Sunday ."" The little man dropped one of his papers , and a flicker of fear went over all the faces of the group . Evidently the awful President , whose name was Sunday , did sometimes send down such irregular ambassadors to such branch meetings . "" Well , comrade ,"" said the man with the papers after a pause , "" I suppose we ' d better give you a seat in the meeting ?"""
chesterton#""" If you ask my advice as a friend ,"" said Syme with severe benevolence , "" I think you ' d better ."" When Gregory heard the dangerous dialogue end , with a sudden safety for his rival , he rose abruptly and paced the floor in painful thought . He was , indeed , in an agony of diplomacy . It was clear that Syme ' s inspired impudence was likely to bring him out of all merely accidental dilemmas . Little was to be hoped from them . He could not himself betray Syme , partly from honour , but partly also because , if he betrayed him and for some reason failed to destroy him , the Syme who escaped would be a Syme freed from all obligation of secrecy , a Syme who would simply walk to the nearest police station ."
chesterton#"After all , it was only one night ' s discussion , and only one detective who would know of it . He would let out as little as possible of their plans that night , and then let Syme go , and chance it . He strode across to the group of anarchists , which was already distributing itself along the benches . "" I think it is time we began ,"" he said ; "" the steam - tug is waiting on the river already . I move that Comrade Buttons takes the chair ."" This being approved by a show of hands , the little man with the papers slipped into the presidential seat ."
chesterton#""" Comrades ,"" he began , as sharp as a pistol - shot , "" our meeting tonight is important , though it need not be long . This branch has always had the honour of electing Thursdays for the Central European Council . We have elected many and splendid Thursdays . We all lament the sad decease of the heroic worker who occupied the post until last week . As you know , his services to the cause were considerable . He organised the great dynamite coup of Brighton which , under happier circumstances , ought to have killed everybody on the pier ."
chesterton#As you also know , his death was as self - denying as his life , for he died through his faith in a hygienic mixture of chalk and water as a substitute for milk , which beverage he regarded as barbaric , and as involving cruelty to the cow . Cruelty , or anything approaching to cruelty , revolted him always . But it is not to acclaim his virtues that we are met , but for a harder task . It is difficult properly to praise his qualities , but it is more difficult to replace them . Upon you , comrades , it devolves this evening to choose out of the company present the man who shall be Thursday . If any comrade suggests a name I will put it to the vote .
chesterton#"If no comrade suggests a name , I can only tell myself that that dear dynamiter , who is gone from us , has carried into the unknowable abysses the last secret of his virtue and his innocence ."" There was a stir of almost inaudible applause , such as is sometimes heard in church . Then a large old man , with a long and venerable white beard , perhaps the only real working - man present , rose lumberingly and said -- "" I move that Comrade Gregory be elected Thursday ,"" and sat lumberingly down again . "" Does anyone second ?"" asked the chairman ."
chesterton#"A little man with a velvet coat and pointed beard seconded . "" Before I put the matter to the vote ,"" said the chairman , "" I will call on Comrade Gregory to make a statement ."" Gregory rose amid a great rumble of applause . His face was deadly pale , so that by contrast his queer red hair looked almost scarlet . But he was smiling and altogether at ease . He had made up his mind , and he saw his best policy quite plain in front of him like a white road ."
chesterton#"His best chance was to make a softened and ambiguous speech , such as would leave on the detective ' s mind the impression that the anarchist brotherhood was a very mild affair after all . He believed in his own literary power , his capacity for suggesting fine shades and picking perfect words . He thought that with care he could succeed , in spite of all the people around him , in conveying an impression of the institution , subtly and delicately false . Syme had once thought that anarchists , under all their bravado , were only playing the fool . Could he not now , in the hour of peril , make Syme think so again ? "" Comrades ,"" began Gregory , in a low but penetrating voice , "" it is not necessary for me to tell you what is my policy , for it is your policy also ."
chesterton#Our belief has been slandered , it has been disfigured , it has been utterly confused and concealed , but it has never been altered . Those who talk about anarchism and its dangers go everywhere and anywhere to get their information , except to us , except to the fountain head . They learn about anarchists from sixpenny novels ; they learn about anarchists from tradesmen ' s newspapers ; they learn about anarchists from Ally Sloper ' s Half - Holiday and the Sporting Times . They never learn about anarchists from anarchists . We have no chance of denying the mountainous slanders which are heaped upon our heads from one end of Europe to another . The man who has always heard that we are walking plagues has never heard our reply .
chesterton#I know that he will not hear it tonight , though my passion were to rend the roof . For it is deep , deep under the earth that the persecuted are permitted to assemble , as the Christians assembled in the Catacombs . But if , by some incredible accident , there were here tonight a man who all his life had thus immensely misunderstood us , I would put this question to him : ' When those Christians met in those Catacombs , what sort of moral reputation had they in the streets above ? What tales were told of their atrocities by one educated Roman to another ? Suppose ' ( I would say to him ), ' suppose that we are only repeating that still mysterious paradox of history . Suppose we seem as shocking as the Christians because we are really as harmless as the Christians .
chesterton#"Suppose we seem as mad as the Christians because we are really as meek .""' The applause that had greeted the opening sentences had been gradually growing fainter , and at the last word it stopped suddenly . In the abrupt silence , the man with the velvet jacket said , in a high , squeaky voice -- "" I ' m not meek !"" "" Comrade Witherspoon tells us ,"" resumed Gregory , "" that he is not meek . Ah , how little he knows himself !"
chesterton#"His words are , indeed , extravagant ; his appearance is ferocious , and even ( to an ordinary taste ) unattractive . But only the eye of a friendship as deep and delicate as mine can perceive the deep foundation of solid meekness which lies at the base of him , too deep even for himself to see . I repeat , we are the true early Christians , only that we come too late . We are simple , as they revere simple -- look at Comrade Witherspoon . We are modest , as they were modest -- look at me . We are merciful --"""
chesterton#""" No , no !"" called out Mr . Witherspoon with the velvet jacket . "" I say we are merciful ,"" repeated Gregory furiously , "" as the early Christians were merciful . Yet this did not prevent their being accused of eating human flesh . We do not eat human flesh --"" "" Shame !"""
chesterton#"cried Witherspoon . "" Why not ?"" "" Comrade Witherspoon ,"" said Gregory , with a feverish gaiety , "" is anxious to know why nobody eats him ( laughter ). In our society , at any rate , which loves him sincerely , which is founded upon love --"" "" No , no !"" said Witherspoon , "" down with love ."""
chesterton#""" Which is founded upon love ,"" repeated Gregory , grinding his teeth , "" there will be no difficulty about the aims which we shall pursue as a body , or which I should pursue were I chosen as the representative of that body . Superbly careless of the slanders that represent us as assassins and enemies of human society , we shall pursue with moral courage and quiet intellectual pressure , the permanent ideals of brotherhood and simplicity ."" Gregory resumed his seat and passed his hand across his forehead . The silence was sudden and awkward , but the chairman rose like an automaton , and said in a colourless voice -- "" Does anyone oppose the election of Comrade Gregory ?"" The assembly seemed vague and sub - consciously disappointed , and Comrade Witherspoon moved restlessly on his seat and muttered in his thick beard ."
chesterton#"By the sheer rush of routine , however , the motion would have been put and carried . But as the chairman was opening his mouth to put it , Syme sprang to his feet and said in a small and quiet voice -- "" Yes , Mr . Chairman , I oppose ."" The most effective fact in oratory is an unexpected change in the voice . Mr . Gabriel Syme evidently understood oratory . Having said these first formal words in a moderated tone and with a brief simplicity , he made his next word ring and volley in the vault as if one of the guns had gone off ."
chesterton#""" Comrades !"" he cried , in a voice that made every man jump out of his boots , "" have we come here for this ? Do we live underground like rats in order to listen to talk like this ? This is talk we might listen to while eating buns at a Sunday School treat . Do we line these walls with weapons and bar that door with death lest anyone should come and hear Comrade Gregory saying to us , ' Be good , and you will be happy ,' ' Honesty is the best policy ,' and ' Virtue is its own reward '? There was not a word in Comrade Gregory ' s address to which a curate could not have listened with pleasure ( hear , hear )."
chesterton#"But I am not a curate ( loud cheers ), and I did not listen to it with pleasure ( renewed cheers ). The man who is fitted to make a good curate is not fitted to make a resolute , forcible , and efficient Thursday ( hear , hear )."" "" Comrade Gregory has told us , in only too apologetic a tone , that we are not the enemies of society . But I say that we are the enemies of society , and so much the worse for society . We are the enemies of society , for society is the enemy of humanity , its oldest and its most pitiless enemy ( hear , hear ). Comrade Gregory has told us ( apologetically again ) that we are not murderers ."
chesterton#"There I agree . We are not murderers , we are executioners ( cheers )."" Ever since Syme had risen Gregory had sat staring at him , his face idiotic with astonishment . Now in the pause his lips of clay parted , and he said , with an automatic and lifeless distinctness -- "" You damnable hypocrite !"" Syme looked straight into those frightful eyes with his own pale blue ones , and said with dignity --"
chesterton#""" Comrade Gregory accuses me of hypocrisy . He knows as well as I do that I am keeping all my engagements and doing nothing but my duty . I do not mince words . I do not pretend to . I say that Comrade Gregory is unfit to be Thursday for all his amiable qualities . He is unfit to be Thursday because of his amiable qualities ."
chesterton#"We do not want the Supreme Council of Anarchy infected with a maudlin mercy ( hear , hear ). This is no time for ceremonial politeness , neither is it a time for ceremonial modesty . I set myself against Comrade Gregory as I would set myself against all the Governments of Europe , because the anarchist who has given himself to anarchy has forgotten modesty as much as he has forgotten pride ( cheers ). I am not a man at all . I am a cause ( renewed cheers ). I set myself against Comrade Gregory as impersonally and as calmly as I should choose one pistol rather than another out of that rack upon the wall ; and I say that rather than have Gregory and his milk - and - water methods on the Supreme Council , I would offer myself for election --"""
chesterton#"His sentence was drowned in a deafening cataract of applause . The faces , that had grown fiercer and fiercer with approval as his tirade grew more and more uncompromising , were now distorted with grins of anticipation or cloven with delighted cries . At the moment when he announced himself as ready to stand for the post of Thursday , a roar of excitement and assent broke forth , and became uncontrollable , and at the same moment Gregory sprang to his feet , with foam upon his mouth , and shouted against the shouting . "" Stop , you blasted madmen !"" he cried , at the top of a voice that tore his throat . "" Stop , you --"""
chesterton#"But louder than Gregory ' s shouting and louder than the roar of the room came the voice of Syme , still speaking in a peal of pitiless thunder -- "" I do not go to the Council to rebut that slander that calls us murderers ; I go to earn it ( loud and prolonged cheering ). To the priest who says these men are the enemies of religion , to the judge who says these men are the enemies of law , to the fat parliamentarian who says these men are the enemies of order and public decency , to all these I will reply , ' You are false kings , but you are true prophets . I am come to destroy you , and to fulfil your prophecies .'"" The heavy clamour gradually died away , but before it had ceased Witherspoon had jumped to his feet , his hair and beard all on end , and had said -- "" I move , as an amendment , that Comrade Syme be appointed to the post ."""
chesterton#""" Stop all this , I tell you !"" cried Gregory , with frantic face and hands . "" Stop it , it is all --"" The voice of the chairman clove his speech with a cold accent . "" Does anyone second this amendment ?"" he said ."
chesterton#"A tall , tired man , with melancholy eyes and an American chin beard , was observed on the back bench to be slowly rising to his feet . Gregory had been screaming for some time past ; now there was a change in his accent , more shocking than any scream . "" I end all this !"" he said , in a voice as heavy as stone . "" This man cannot be elected . He is a --"""
chesterton#""" Yes ,"" said Syme , quite motionless , "" what is he ?"" Gregory ' s mouth worked twice without sound ; then slowly the blood began to crawl back into his dead face . "" He is a man quite inexperienced in our work ,"" he said , and sat down abruptly . Before he had done so , the long , lean man with the American beard was again upon his feet , and was repeating in a high American monotone -- "" I beg to second the election of Comrade Syme ."" "" The amendment will , as usual , be put first ,"" said Mr . Buttons , the chairman , with mechanical rapidity ."
chesterton#""" The question is that Comrade Syme --"" Gregory had again sprung to his feet , panting and passionate . "" Comrades ,"" he cried out , "" I am not a madman ."" "" Oh , oh !"" said Mr . Witherspoon . "" I am not a madman ,"" reiterated Gregory , with a frightful sincerity which for a moment staggered the room , "" but I give you a counsel which you can call mad if you like ."
chesterton#"No , I will not call it a counsel , for I can give you no reason for it . I will call it a command . Call it a mad command , but act upon it . Strike , but hear me ! Kill me , but obey me ! Do not elect this man ."""
chesterton#"Truth is so terrible , even in fetters , that for a moment Syme ' s slender and insane victory swayed like a reed . But you could not have guessed it from Syme ' s bleak blue eyes . He merely began -- "" Comrade Gregory commands --"" Then the spell was snapped , and one anarchist called out to Gregory -- "" Who are you ?"
chesterton#"You are not Sunday ""; and another anarchist added in a heavier voice , "" And you are not Thursday ."" "" Comrades ,"" cried Gregory , in a voice like that of a martyr who in an ecstacy of pain has passed beyond pain , "" it is nothing to me whether you detest me as a tyrant or detest me as a slave . If you will not take my command , accept my degradation . I kneel to you . I throw myself at your feet . I implore you ."
chesterton#"Do not elect this man ."" "" Comrade Gregory ,"" said the chairman after a painful pause , "" this is really not quite dignified ."" For the first time in the proceedings there was for a few seconds a real silence . Then Gregory fell back in his seat , a pale wreck of a man , and the chairman repeated , like a piece of clock - work suddenly started again -- "" The question is that Comrade Syme be elected to the post of Thursday on the General Council ."" The roar rose like the sea , the hands rose like a forest , and three minutes afterwards Mr . Gabriel Syme , of the Secret Police Service , was elected to the post of Thursday on the General Council of the Anarchists of Europe ."
chesterton#"Everyone in the room seemed to feel the tug waiting on the river , the sword - stick and the revolver , waiting on the table . The instant the election was ended and irrevocable , and Syme had received the paper proving his election , they all sprang to their feet , and the fiery groups moved and mixed in the room . Syme found himself , somehow or other , face to face with Gregory , who still regarded him with a stare of stunned hatred . They were silent for many minutes . "" You are a devil !"" said Gregory at last ."
chesterton#""" And you are a gentleman ,"" said Syme with gravity . "" It was you that entrapped me ,"" began Gregory , shaking from head to foot , "" entrapped me into --"" "" Talk sense ,"" said Syme shortly . "" Into what sort of devils ' parliament have you entrapped me , if it comes to that ? You made me swear before I made you . Perhaps we are both doing what we think right ."
chesterton#"But what we think right is so damned different that there can be nothing between us in the way of concession . There is nothing possible between us but honour and death ,"" and he pulled the great cloak about his shoulders and picked up the flask from the table . "" The boat is quite ready ,"" said Mr . Buttons , bustling up . "" Be good enough to step this way ."" With a gesture that revealed the shop - walker , he led Syme down a short , iron - bound passage , the still agonised Gregory following feverishly at their heels . At the end of the passage was a door , which Buttons opened sharply , showing a sudden blue and silver picture of the moonlit river , that looked like a scene in a theatre ."
chesterton#"Close to the opening lay a dark , dwarfish steam - launch , like a baby dragon with one red eye . Almost in the act of stepping on board , Gabriel Syme turned to the gaping Gregory . "" You have kept your word ,"" he said gently , with his face in shadow . "" You are a man of honour , and I thank you . You have kept it even down to a small particular . There was one special thing you promised me at the beginning of the affair , and which you have certainly given me by the end of it ."""
chesterton#""" What do you mean ?"" cried the chaotic Gregory . "" What did I promise you ?"" "" A very entertaining evening ,"" said Syme , and he made a military salute with the sword - stick as the steamboat slid away . CHAPTER IV THE TALE OF A DETECTIVE"
chesterton#GABRIEL SYME was not merely a detective who pretended to be a poet ; he was really a poet who had become a detective . Nor was his hatred of anarchy hypocritical . He was one of those who are driven early in life into too conservative an attitude by the bewildering folly of most revolutionists . He had not attained it by any tame tradition . His respectability was spontaneous and sudden , a rebellion against rebellion . He came of a family of cranks , in which all the oldest people had all the newest notions .
chesterton#One of his uncles always walked about without a hat , and another had made an unsuccessful attempt to walk about with a hat and nothing else . His father cultivated art and self - realisation ; his mother went in for simplicity and hygiene . Hence the child , during his tenderer years , was wholly unacquainted with any drink between the extremes of absinth and cocoa , of both of which he had a healthy dislike . The more his mother preached a more than Puritan abstinence the more did his father expand into a more than pagan latitude ; and by the time the former had come to enforcing vegetarianism , the latter had pretty well reached the point of defending cannibalism . Being surrounded with every conceivable kind of revolt from infancy , Gabriel had to revolt into something , so he revolted into the only thing left -- sanity . But there was just enough in him of the blood of these fanatics to make even his protest for common sense a little too fierce to be sensible .
chesterton#His hatred of modern lawlessness had been crowned also by an accident . It happened that he was walking in a side street at the instant of a dynamite outrage . He had been blind and deaf for a moment , and then seen , the smoke clearing , the broken windows and the bleeding faces . After that he went about as usual -- quiet , courteous , rather gentle ; but there was a spot on his mind that was not sane . He did not regard anarchists , as most of us do , as a handful of morbid men , combining ignorance with intellectualism . He regarded them as a huge and pitiless peril , like a Chinese invasion .
chesterton#He poured perpetually into newspapers and their waste - paper baskets a torrent of tales , verses and violent articles , warning men of this deluge of barbaric denial . But he seemed to be getting no nearer his enemy , and , what was worse , no nearer a living . As he paced the Thames embankment , bitterly biting a cheap cigar and brooding on the advance of Anarchy , there was no anarchist with a bomb in his pocket so savage or so solitary as he . Indeed , he always felt that Government stood alone and desperate , with its back to the wall . He was too quixotic to have cared for it otherwise . He walked on the Embankment once under a dark red sunset .
chesterton#The red river reflected the red sky , and they both reflected his anger . The sky , indeed , was so swarthy , and the light on the river relatively so lurid , that the water almost seemed of fiercer flame than the sunset it mirrored . It looked like a stream of literal fire winding under the vast caverns of a subterranean country . Syme was shabby in those days . He wore an old - fashioned black chimney - pot hat ; he was wrapped in a yet more old - fashioned cloak , black and ragged ; and the combination gave him the look of the early villains in Dickens and Bulwer Lytton . Also his yellow beard and hair were more unkempt and leonine than when they appeared long afterwards , cut and pointed , on the lawns of Saffron Park .
chesterton#"A long , lean , black cigar , bought in Soho for twopence , stood out from between his tightened teeth , and altogether he looked a very satisfactory specimen of the anarchists upon whom he had vowed a holy war . Perhaps this was why a policeman on the Embankment spoke to him , and said "" Good evening ."" Syme , at a crisis of his morbid fears for humanity , seemed stung by the mere stolidity of the automatic official , a mere bulk of blue in the twilight . "" A good evening is it ?"" he said sharply . "" You fellows would call the end of the world a good evening ."
chesterton#"Look at that bloody red sun and that bloody river ! I tell you that if that were literally human blood , spilt and shining , you would still be standing here as solid as ever , looking out for some poor harmless tramp whom you could move on . You policemen are cruel to the poor , but I could forgive you even your cruelty if it were not for your calm ."" "" If we are calm ,"" replied the policeman , "" it is the calm of organised resistance ."" "" Eh ?"" said Syme , staring ."
chesterton#""" The soldier must be calm in the thick of the battle ,"" pursued the policeman . "" The composure of an army is the anger of a nation ."" "" Good God , the Board Schools !"" said Syme . "" Is this undenominational education ?"" "" No ,"" said the policeman sadly , "" I never had any of those advantages ."
chesterton#"The Board Schools came after my time . What education I had was very rough and old - fashioned , I am afraid ."" "" Where did you have it ?"" asked Syme , wondering . "" Oh , at Harrow ,"" said the policeman The class sympathies which , false as they are , are the truest things in so many men , broke out of Syme before he could control them ."
chesterton#""" But , good Lord , man ,"" he said , "" you oughtn ' t to be a policeman !"" The policeman sighed and shook his head . "" I know ,"" he said solemnly , "" I know I am not worthy ."" "" But why did you join the police ?"" asked Syme with rude curiosity . "" For much the same reason that you abused the police ,"" replied the other ."
chesterton#""" I found that there was a special opening in the service for those whose fears for humanity were concerned rather with the aberrations of the scientific intellect than with the normal and excusable , though excessive , outbreaks of the human will . I trust I make myself clear ."" "" If you mean that you make your opinion clear ,"" said Syme , "" I suppose you do . But as for making yourself clear , it is the last thing you do . How comes a man like you to be talking philosophy in a blue helmet on the Thames embankment ? "" You have evidently not heard of the latest development in our police system ,"" replied the other ."
chesterton#""" I am not surprised at it . We are keeping it rather dark from the educated class , because that class contains most of our enemies . But you seem to be exactly in the right frame of mind . I think you might almost join us ."" "" Join you in what ?"" asked Syme ."
chesterton#""" I will tell you ,"" said the policeman slowly . "" This is the situation : The head of one of our departments , one of the most celebrated detectives in Europe , has long been of opinion that a purely intellectual conspiracy would soon threaten the very existence of civilisation . He is certain that the scientific and artistic worlds are silently bound in a crusade against the Family and the State . He has , therefore , formed a special corps of policemen , policemen who are also philosophers . It is their business to watch the beginnings of this conspiracy , not merely in a criminal but in a controversial sense . I am a democrat myself , and I am fully aware of the value of the ordinary man in matters of ordinary valour or virtue ."
chesterton#"But it would obviously be undesirable to employ the common policeman in an investigation which is also a heresy hunt ."" Syme ' s eyes were bright with a sympathetic curiosity . "" What do you do , then ?"" he said . "" The work of the philosophical policeman ,"" replied the man in blue , "" is at once bolder and more subtle than that of the ordinary detective . The ordinary detective goes to pot - houses to arrest thieves ; we go to artistic tea - parties to detect pessimists ."
chesterton#"The ordinary detective discovers from a ledger or a diary that a crime has been committed . We discover from a book of sonnets that a crime will be committed . We have to trace the origin of those dreadful thoughts that drive men on at last to intellectual fanaticism and intellectual crime . We were only just in time to prevent the assassination at Hartle pool , and that was entirely due to the fact that our Mr . Wilks ( a smart young fellow ) thoroughly understood a triolet ."" "" Do you mean ,"" asked Syme , "" that there is really as much connection between crime and the modern intellect as all that ?"" "" You are not sufficiently democratic ,"" answered the policeman , "" but you were right when you said just now that our ordinary treatment of the poor criminal was a pretty brutal business ."
chesterton#I tell you I am sometimes sick of my trade when I see how perpetually it means merely a war upon the ignorant and the desperate . But this new movement of ours is a very different affair . We deny the snobbish English assumption that the uneducated are the dangerous criminals . We remember the Roman Emperors . We remember the great poisoning princes of the Renaissance . We say that the dangerous criminal is the educated criminal .
chesterton#We say that the most dangerous criminal now is the entirely lawless modern philosopher . Compared to him , burglars and bigamists are essentially moral men ; my heart goes out to them . They accept the essential ideal of man ; they merely seek it wrongly . Thieves respect property . They merely wish the property to become their property that they may more perfectly respect it . But philosophers dislike property as property ; they wish to destroy the very idea of personal possession .
chesterton#"Bigamists respect marriage , or they would not go through the highly ceremonial and even ritualistic formality of bigamy . But philosophers despise marriage as marriage . Murderers respect human life ; they merely wish to attain a greater fulness of human life in themselves by the sacrifice of what seems to them to be lesser lives . But philosophers hate life itself , their own as much as other people ' s ."" Syme struck his hands together . "" How true that is ,"" he cried ."
chesterton#""" I have felt it from my boyhood , but never could state the verbal antithesis . The common criminal is a bad man , but at least he is , as it were , a conditional good man . He says that if only a certain obstacle be removed -- say a wealthy uncle -- he is then prepared to accept the universe and to praise God . He is a reformer , but not an anarchist . He wishes to cleanse the edifice , but not to destroy it . But the evil philosopher is not trying to alter things , but to annihilate them ."
chesterton#"Yes , the modern world has retained all those parts of police work which are really oppressive and ignominious , the harrying of the poor , the spying upon the unfortunate . It has given up its more dignified work , the punishment of powerful traitors the in the State and powerful heresiarchs in the Church . The moderns say we must not punish heretics . My only doubt is whether we have a right to punish anybody else ."" "" But this is absurd !"" cried the policeman , clasping his hands with an excitement uncommon in persons of his figure and costume , "" but it is intolerable !"
chesterton#"I don ' t know what you ' re doing , but you ' re wasting your life . You must , you shall , join our special army against anarchy . Their armies are on our frontiers . Their bolt is ready to fall . A moment more , and you may lose the glory of working with us , perhaps the glory of dying with the last heroes of the world ."" "" It is a chance not to be missed , certainly ,"" assented Syme , "" but still I do not quite understand ."
chesterton#"I know as well as anybody that the modern world is full of lawless little men and mad little movements . But , beastly as they are , they generally have the one merit of disagreeing with each other . How can you talk of their leading one army or hurling one bolt . What is this anarchy ?"" "" Do not confuse it ,"" replied the constable , "" with those chance dynamite outbreaks from Russia or from Ireland , which are really the outbreaks of oppressed , if mistaken , men . This is a vast philosophic movement , consisting of an outer and an inner ring ."
chesterton#You might even call the outer ring the laity and the inner ring the priesthood . I prefer to call the outer ring the innocent section , the inner ring the supremely guilty section . The outer ring -- the main mass of their supporters -- are merely anarchists ; that is , men who believe that rules and formulas have destroyed human happiness . They believe that all the evil results of human crime are the results of the system that has called it crime . They do not believe that the crime creates the punishment . They believe that the punishment has created the crime .
chesterton#"They believe that if a man seduced seven women he would naturally walk away as blameless as the flowers of spring . They believe that if a man picked a pocket he would naturally feel exquisitely good . These I call the innocent section ."" "" Oh !"" said Syme . "" Naturally , therefore , these people talk about ' a happy time coming '; ' the paradise of the future '; ' mankind freed from the bondage of vice and the bondage of virtue ,' and so on ."
chesterton#"And so also the men of the inner circle speak -- the sacred priesthood . They also speak to applauding crowds of the happiness of the future , and of mankind freed at last . But in their mouths ""-- and the policeman lowered his voice --"" in their mouths these happy phrases have a horrible meaning . They are under no illusions ; they are too intellectual to think that man upon this earth can ever be quite free of original sin and the struggle . And they mean death . When they say that mankind shall be free at last , they mean that mankind shall commit suicide ."
chesterton#"When they talk of a paradise without right or wrong , they mean the grave . They have but two objects , to destroy first humanity and then themselves . That is why they throw bombs instead of firing pistols . The innocent rank and file are disappointed because the bomb has not killed the king ; but the high - priesthood are happy because it has killed somebody ."" "" How can I join you ?"" asked Syme , with a sort of passion ."
chesterton#""" I know for a fact that there is a vacancy at the moment ,"" said the policeman , "" as I have the honour to be somewhat in the confidence of the chief of whom I have spoken . You should really come and see him . Or rather , I should not say see him , nobody ever sees him ; but you can talk to him if you like ."" "" Telephone ?"" inquired Syme , with interest . "" No ,"" said the policeman placidly , "" he has a fancy for always sitting in a pitch - dark room ."
chesterton#"He says it makes his thoughts brighter . Do come along ."" Somewhat dazed and considerably excited , Syme allowed himself to be led to a side - door in the long row of buildings of Scotland Yard . Almost before he knew what he was doing , he had been passed through the hands of about four intermediate officials , and was suddenly shown into a room , the abrupt blackness of which startled him like a blaze of light . It was not the ordinary darkness , in which forms can be faintly traced ; it was like going suddenly stone - blind . "" Are you the new recruit ?"""
chesterton#"asked a heavy voice . And in some strange way , though there was not the shadow of a shape in the gloom , Syme knew two things : first , that it came from a man of massive stature ; and second , that the man had his back to him . "" Are you the new recruit ?"" said the invisible chief , who seemed to have heard all about it . "" All right . You are engaged ."""
chesterton#"Syme , quite swept off his feet , made a feeble fight against this irrevocable phrase . "" I really have no experience ,"" he began . "" No one has any experience ,"" said the other , "" of the Battle of Armageddon ."" "" But I am really unfit --"" "" You are willing , that is enough ,"" said the unknown . "" Well , really ,"" said Syme , "" I don ' t know any profession of which mere willingness is the final test ."""
chesterton#""" I do ,"" said the other --"" martyrs . I am condemning you to death . Good day ."" Thus it was that when Gabriel Syme came out again into the crimson light of evening , in his shabby black hat and shabby , lawless cloak , he came out a member of the New Detective Corps for the frustration of the great conspiracy . Acting under the advice of his friend the policeman ( who was professionally inclined to neatness ), he trimmed his hair and beard , bought a good hat , clad himself in an exquisite summer suit of light blue - grey , with a pale yellow flower in the button - hole , and , in short , became that elegant and rather insupportable person whom Gregory had first encountered in the little garden of Saffron Park . Before he finally left the police premises his friend provided him with a small blue card , on which was written , "" The Last Crusade ,"" and a number , the sign of his official authority ."
chesterton#He put this carefully in his upper waistcoat pocket , lit a cigarette , and went forth to track and fight the enemy in all the drawing - rooms of London . Where his adventure ultimately led him we have already seen . At about half - past one on a February night he found himself steaming in a small tug up the silent Thames , armed with swordstick and revolver , the duly elected Thursday of the Central Council of Anarchists . When Syme stepped out on to the steam - tug he had a singular sensation of stepping out into something entirely new ; not merely into the landscape of a new land , but even into the landscape of a new planet . This was mainly due to the insane yet solid decision of that evening , though partly also to an entire change in the weather and the sky since he entered the little tavern some two hours before . Every trace of the passionate plumage of the cloudy sunset had been swept away , and a naked moon stood in a naked sky .
chesterton#The moon was so strong and full that ( by a paradox often to be noticed ) it seemed like a weaker sun . It gave , not the sense of bright moonshine , but rather of a dead daylight . Over the whole landscape lay a luminous and unnatural discoloration , as of that disastrous twilight which Milton spoke of as shed by the sun in eclipse ; so that Syme fell easily into his first thought , that he was actually on some other and emptier planet , which circled round some sadder star . But the more he felt this glittering desolation in the moonlit land , the more his own chivalric folly glowed in the night like a great fire . Even the common things he carried with him -- the food and the brandy and the loaded pistol -- took on exactly that concrete and material poetry which a child feels when he takes a gun upon a journey or a bun with him to bed . The sword - stick and the brandy - flask , though in themselves only the tools of morbid conspirators , became the expressions of his own more healthy romance .
chesterton#The sword - stick became almost the sword of chivalry , and the brandy the wine of the stirrup - cup . For even the most dehumanised modern fantasies depend on some older and simpler figure ; the adventures may be mad , but the adventurer must be sane . The dragon without St . George would not even be grotesque . So this inhuman landscape was only imaginative by the presence of a man really human . To Syme ' s exaggerative mind the bright , bleak houses and terraces by the Thames looked as empty as the mountains of the moon . But even the moon is only poetical because there is a man in the moon .
chesterton#The tug was worked by two men , and with much toil went comparatively slowly . The clear moon that had lit up Chiswick had gone down by the time that they passed Battersea , and when they came under the enormous bulk of Westminster day had already begun to break . It broke like the splitting of great bars of lead , showing bars of silver ; and these had brightened like white fire when the tug , changing its onward course , turned inward to a large landing stage rather beyond Charing Cross . The great stones of the Embankment seemed equally dark and gigantic as Syme looked up at them . They were big and black against the huge white dawn . They made him feel that he was landing on the colossal steps of some Egyptian palace ; and , indeed , the thing suited his mood , for he was , in his own mind , mounting to attack the solid thrones of horrible and heathen kings .
chesterton#He leapt out of the boat on to one slimy step , and stood , a dark and slender figure , amid the enormous masonry . The two men in the tug put her off again and turned up stream . They had never spoken a word . CHAPTER V THE FEAST OF FEAR AT first the large stone stair seemed to Syme as deserted as a pyramid ; but before he reached the top he had realised that there was a man leaning over the parapet of the Embankment and looking out across the river .
chesterton#As a figure he was quite conventional , clad in a silk hat and frock - coat of the more formal type of fashion ; he had a red flower in his buttonhole . As Syme drew nearer to him step by step , he did not even move a hair ; and Syme could come close enough to notice even in the dim , pale morning light that his face was long , pale and intellectual , and ended in a small triangular tuft of dark beard at the very point of the chin , all else being clean - shaven . This scrap of hair almost seemed a mere oversight ; the rest of the face was of the type that is best shaven -- clear - cut , ascetic , and in its way noble . Syme drew closer and closer , noting all this , and still the figure did not stir . At first an instinct had told Syme that this was the man whom he was meant to meet . Then , seeing that the man made no sign , he had concluded that he was not .
chesterton#And now again he had come back to a certainty that the man had something to do with his mad adventure . For the man remained more still than would have been natural if a stranger had come so close . He was as motionless as a wax - work , and got on the nerves somewhat in the same way . Syme looked again and again at the pale , dignified and delicate face , and the face still looked blankly across the river . Then he took out of his pocket the note from Buttons proving his election , and put it before that sad and beautiful face . Then the man smiled , and his smile was a shock , for it was all on one side , going up in the right cheek and down in the left .
chesterton#There was nothing , rationally speaking , to scare anyone about this . Many people have this nervous trick of a crooked smile , and in many it is even attractive . But in all Syme ' s circumstances , with the dark dawn and the deadly errand and the loneliness on the great dripping stones , there was something unnerving in it . There was the silent river and the silent man , a man of even classic face . And there was the last nightmare touch that his smile suddenly went wrong . The spasm of smile was instantaneous , and the man ' s face dropped at once into its harmonious melancholy .
chesterton#"He spoke without further explanation or inquiry , like a man speaking to an old colleague . "" If we walk up towards Leicester Square ,"" he said , "" we shall just be in time for breakfast . Sunday always insists on an early breakfast . Have you had any sleep ?"" "" No ,"" said Syme . "" Nor have I ,"" answered the man in an ordinary tone ."
chesterton#""" I shall try to get to bed after breakfast ."" He spoke with casual civility , but in an utterly dead voice that contradicted the fanaticism of his face . It seemed almost as if all friendly words were to him lifeless conveniences , and that his only life was hate . After a pause the man spoke again . "" Of course , the Secretary of the branch told you everything that can be told . But the one thing that can never be told is the last notion of the President , for his notions grow like a tropical forest ."
chesterton#So in case you don ' t know , I ' d better tell you that he is carrying out his notion of concealing ourselves by not concealing ourselves to the most extraordinary lengths just now . Originally , of course , we met in a cell underground , just as your branch does . Then Sunday made us take a private room at an ordinary restaurant . He said that if you didn ' t seem to be hiding nobody hunted you out . Well , he is the only man on earth , I know ; but sometimes I really think that his huge brain is going a little mad in its old age . For now we flaunt ourselves before the public .
chesterton#"We have our breakfast on a balcony -- on a balcony , if you please -- overlooking Leicester Square ."" "" And what do the people say ?"" asked Syme . "" It ' s quite simple what they say ,"" answered his guide . "" They say we are a lot of jolly gentlemen who pretend they are anarchists ."" "" It seems to me a very clever idea ,"" said Syme ."
chesterton#""" Clever ! God blast your impudence ! Clever !"" cried out the other in a sudden , shrill voice which was as startling and discordant as his crooked smile . "" When you ' ve seen Sunday for a split second you ' ll leave off calling him clever ."" With this they emerged out of a narrow street , and saw the early sunlight filling Leicester Square ."
chesterton#It will never be known , I suppose , why this square itself should look so alien and in some ways so continental . It will never be known whether it was the foreign look that attracted the foreigners or the foreigners who gave it the foreign look . But on this particular morning the effect seemed singularly bright and clear . Between the open square and the sunlit leaves and the statue and the Saracenic outlines of the Alhambra , it looked the replica of some French or even Spanish public place . And this effect increased in Syme the sensation , which in many shapes he had had through the whole adventure , the eerie sensation of having strayed into a new world . As a fact , he had bought bad cigars round Leicester Square ever since he was a boy .
chesterton#But as he turned that corner , and saw the trees and the Moorish cupolas , he could have sworn that he was turning into an unknown Place de something or other in some foreign town . At one corner of the square there projected a kind of angle of a prosperous but quiet hotel , the bulk of which belonged to a street behind . In the wall there was one large French window , probably the window of a large coffee - room ; and outside this window , almost literally overhanging the square , was a formidably buttressed balcony , big enough to contain a dining - table . In fact , it did contain a dining - table , or more strictly a breakfast - table ; and round the breakfast - table , glowing in the sunlight and evident to the street , were a group of noisy and talkative men , all dressed in the insolence of fashion , with white waistcoats and expensive button - holes . Some of their jokes could almost be heard across the square . Then the grave Secretary gave his unnatural smile , and Syme knew that this boisterous breakfast party was the secret conclave of the European Dynamiters .
chesterton#Then , as Syme continued to stare at them , he saw something that he had not seen before . He had not seen it literally because it was too large to see . At the nearest end of the balcony , blocking up a great part of the perspective , was the back of a great mountain of a man . When Syme had seen him , his first thought was that the weight of him must break down the balcony of stone . His vastness did not lie only in the fact that he was abnormally tall and quite incredibly fat . This man was planned enormously in his original proportions , like a statue carved deliberately as colossal .
chesterton#"His head , crowned with white hair , as seen from behind looked bigger than a head ought to be . The ears that stood out from it looked larger than human ears . He was enlarged terribly to scale ; and this sense of size was so staggering , that when Syme saw him all the other figures seemed quite suddenly to dwindle and become dwarfish . They were still sitting there as before with their flowers and frock - coats , but now it looked as if the big man was entertaining five children to tea . As Syme and the guide approached the side door of the hotel , a waiter came out smiling with every tooth in his head . "" The gentlemen are up there , sare ,"" he said ."
chesterton#""" They do talk and they do laugh at what they talk . They do say they will throw bombs at ze king ."" And the waiter hurried away with a napkin over his arm , much pleased with the singular frivolity of the gentlemen upstairs . The two men mounted the stairs in silence . Syme had never thought of asking whether the monstrous man who almost filled and broke the balcony was the great President of whom the others stood in awe . He knew it was so , with an unaccountable but instantaneous certainty ."
chesterton#Syme , indeed , was one of those men who are open to all the more nameless psychological influences in a degree a little dangerous to mental health . Utterly devoid of fear in physical dangers , he was a great deal too sensitive to the smell of spiritual evil . Twice already that night little unmeaning things had peeped out at him almost pruriently , and given him a sense of drawing nearer and nearer to the head - quarters of hell . And this sense became overpowering as he drew nearer to the great President . The form it took was a childish and yet hateful fancy . As he walked across the inner room towards the balcony , the large face of Sunday grew larger and larger ; and Syme was gripped with a fear that when he was quite close the face would be too big to be possible , and that he would scream aloud .
chesterton#He remembered that as a child he would not look at the mask of Memnon in the British Museum , because it was a face , and so large . By an effort , braver than that of leaping over a cliff , he went to an empty seat at the breakfast - table and sat down . The men greeted him with good - humoured raillery as if they had always known him . He sobered himself a little by looking at their conventional coats and solid , shining coffee - pot ; then he looked again at Sunday . His face was very large , but it was still possible to humanity . In the presence of the President the whole company looked sufficiently commonplace ; nothing about them caught the eye at first , except that by the President ' s caprice they had been dressed up with a festive respectability , which gave the meal the look of a wedding breakfast .
chesterton#One man indeed stood out at even a superficial glance . He at least was the common or garden Dynamiter . He wore , indeed , the high white collar and satin tie that were the uniform of the occasion ; but out of this collar there sprang a head quite unmanageable and quite unmistakable , a bewildering bush of brown hair and beard that almost obscured the eyes like those of a Skye terrier . But the eyes did look out of the tangle , and they were the sad eyes of some Russian serf . The effect of this figure was not terrible like that of the President , but it had every diablerie that can come from the utterly grotesque . If out of that stiff tie and collar there had come abruptly the head of a cat or a dog , it could not have been a more idiotic contrast .
chesterton#"The man ' s name , it seemed , was Gogol ; he was a Pole , and in this circle of days he was called Tuesday . His soul and speech were incurably tragic ; he could not force himself to play the prosperous and frivolous part demanded of him by President Sunday . And , indeed , when Syme came in the President , with that daring disregard of public suspicion which was his policy , was actually chaffing Gogol upon his inability to assume conventional graces . "" Our friend Tuesday ,"" said the President in a deep voice at once of quietude and volume , "" our friend Tuesday doesn ' t seem to grasp the idea . He dresses up like a gentleman , but he seems to be too great a soul to behave like one . He insists on the ways of the stage conspirator ."
chesterton#"Now if a gentleman goes about London in a top hat and a frock - coat , no one need know that he is an anarchist . But if a gentleman puts on a top hat and a frock - coat , and then goes about on his hands and knees -- well , he may attract attention . That ' s what Brother Gogol does . He goes about on his hands and knees with such inexhaustible diplomacy , that by this time he finds it quite difficult to walk upright ."" "" I am not good at goncealment ,"" said Gogol sulkily , with a thick foreign accent ; "" I am not ashamed of the cause ."" "" Yes you are , my boy , and so is the cause of you ,"" said the President good - naturedly ."
chesterton#""" You hide as much as anybody ; but you can ' t do it , you see , you ' re such an ass ! You try to combine two inconsistent methods . When a householder finds a man under his bed , he will probably pause to note the circumstance . But if he finds a man under his bed in a top hat , you will agree with me , my dear Tuesday , that he is not likely even to forget it . Now when you were found under Admiral Biffin ' s bed --"" "" I am not good at deception ,"" said Tuesday gloomily , flushing ."
chesterton#""" Right , my boy , right ,"" said the President with a ponderous heartiness , "" you aren ' t good at anything ."" While this stream of conversation continued , Syme was looking more steadily at the men around him . As he did so , he gradually felt all his sense of something spiritually queer return . He had thought at first that they were all of common stature and costume , with the evident exception of the hairy Gogol . But as he looked at the others , he began to see in each of them exactly what he had seen in the man by the river , a demoniac detail somewhere . That lop - sided laugh , which would suddenly disfigure the fine face of his original guide , was typical of all these types ."
chesterton#Each man had something about him , perceived perhaps at the tenth or twentieth glance , which was not normal , and which seemed hardly human . The only metaphor he could think of was this , that they all looked as men of fashion and presence would look , with the additional twist given in a false and curved mirror . Only the individual examples will express this half - concealed eccentricity . Syme ' s original cicerone bore the title of Monday ; he was the Secretary of the Council , and his twisted smile was regarded with more terror than anything , except the President ' s horrible , happy laughter . But now that Syme had more space and light to observe him , there were other touches . His fine face was so emaciated , that Syme thought it must be wasted with some disease ; yet somehow the very distress of his dark eyes denied this .
chesterton#It was no physical ill that troubled him . His eyes were alive with intellectual torture , as if pure thought was pain . He was typical of each of the tribe ; each man was subtly and differently wrong . Next to him sat Tuesday , the tousle - headed Gogol , a man more obviously mad . Next was Wednesday , a certain Marquis de St . Eustache , a sufficiently characteristic figure . The first few glances found nothing unusual about him , except that he was the only man at table who wore the fashionable clothes as if they were really his own .
chesterton#He had a black French beard cut square and a black English frock - coat cut even squarer . But Syme , sensitive to such things , felt somehow that the man carried a rich atmosphere with him , a rich atmosphere that suffocated . It reminded one irrationally of drowsy odours and of dying lamps in the darker poems of Byron and Poe . With this went a sense of his being clad , not in lighter colours , but in softer materials ; his black seemed richer and warmer than the black shades about him , as if it were compounded of profound colour . His black coat looked as if it were only black by being too dense a purple . His black beard looked as if it were only black by being too deep a blue .
chesterton#And in the gloom and thickness of the beard his dark red mouth showed sensual and scornful . Whatever he was he was not a Frenchman ; he might be a Jew ; he might be something deeper yet in the dark heart of the East . In the bright coloured Persian tiles and pictures showing tyrants hunting , you may see just those almond eyes , those blue - black beards , those cruel , crimson lips . Then came Syme , and next a very old man , Professor de Worms , who still kept the chair of Friday , though every day it was expected that his death would leave it empty . Save for his intellect , he was in the last dissolution of senile decay . His face was as grey as his long grey beard , his forehead was lifted and fixed finally in a furrow of mild despair .
chesterton#In no other case , not even that of Gogol , did the bridegroom brilliancy of the morning dress express a more painful contrast . For the red flower in his button - hole showed up against a face that was literally discoloured like lead ; the whole hideous effect was as if some drunken dandies had put their clothes upon a corpse . When he rose or sat down , which was with long labour and peril , something worse was expressed than mere weakness , something indefinably connected with the horror of the whole scene . It did not express decrepitude merely , but corruption . Another hateful fancy crossed Syme ' s quivering mind . He could not help thinking that whenever the man moved a leg or arm might fall off .
chesterton#Right at the end sat the man called Saturday , the simplest and the most baffling of all . He was a short , square man with a dark , square face clean - shaven , a medical practitioner going by the name of Bull . He had that combination of savoir - faire with a sort of well - groomed coarseness which is not uncommon in young doctors . He carried his fine clothes with confidence rather than ease , and he mostly wore a set smile . There was nothing whatever odd about him , except that he wore a pair of dark , almost opaque spectacles . It may have been merely a crescendo of nervous fancy that had gone before , but those black discs were dreadful to Syme ; they reminded him of half - remembered ugly tales , of some story about pennies being put on the eyes of the dead .
chesterton#Syme ' s eye always caught the black glasses and the blind grin . Had the dying Professor worn them , or even the pale Secretary , they would have been appropriate . But on the younger and grosser man they seemed only an enigma . They took away the key of the face . You could not tell what his smile or his gravity meant . Partly from this , and partly because he had a vulgar virility wanting in most of the others it seemed to Syme that he might be the wickedest of all those wicked men .
chesterton#Syme even had the thought that his eyes might be covered up because they were too frightful to see . CHAPTER VI THE EXPOSURE SUCH were the six men who had sworn to destroy the world . Again and again Syme strove to pull together his common sense in their presence . Sometimes he saw for an instant that these notions were subjective , that he was only looking at ordinary men , one of whom was old , another nervous , another short - sighted .
chesterton#The sense of an unnatural symbolism always settled back on him again . Each figure seemed to be , somehow , on the borderland of things , just as their theory was on the borderland of thought . He knew that each one of these men stood at the extreme end , so to speak , of some wild road of reasoning . He could only fancy , as in some old - world fable , that if a man went westward to the end of the world he would find something -- say a tree -- that was more or less than a tree , a tree possessed by a spirit ; and that if he went east to the end of the world he would find something else that was not wholly itself -- a tower , perhaps , of which the very shape was wicked . So these figures seemed to stand up , violent and unaccountable , against an ultimate horizon , visions from the verge . The ends of the earth were closing in .
chesterton#Talk had been going on steadily as he took in the scene ; and not the least of the contrasts of that bewildering breakfast - table was the contrast between the easy and unobtrusive tone of talk and its terrible purport . They were deep in the discussion of an actual and immediate plot . The waiter downstairs had spoken quite correctly when he said that they were talking about bombs and kings . Only three days afterwards the Czar was to meet the President of the French Republic in Paris , and over their bacon and eggs upon their sunny balcony these beaming gentlemen had decided how both should die . Even the instrument was chosen ; the black - bearded Marquis , it appeared , was to carry the bomb . Ordinarily speaking , the proximity of this positive and objective crime would have sobered Syme , and cured him of all his merely mystical tremors .
chesterton#He would have thought of nothing but the need of saving at least two human bodies from being ripped in pieces with iron and roaring gas . But the truth was that by this time he had begun to feel a third kind of fear , more piercing and practical than either his moral revulsion or his social responsibility . Very simply , he had no fear to spare for the French President or the Czar ; he had begun to fear for himself . Most of the talkers took little heed of him , debating now with their faces closer together , and almost uniformly grave , save when for an instant the smile of the Secretary ran aslant across his face as the jagged lightning runs aslant across the sky . But there was one persistent thing which first troubled Syme and at last terrified him . The President was always looking at him , steadily , and with a great and baffling interest .
chesterton#The enormous man was quite quiet , but his blue eyes stood out of his head . And they were always fixed on Syme . Syme felt moved to spring up and leap over the balcony . When the President ' s eyes were on him he felt as if he were made of glass . He had hardly the shred of a doubt that in some silent and extraordinary way Sunday had found out that he was a spy . He looked over the edge of the balcony , and saw a policeman , standing abstractedly just beneath , staring at the bright railings and the sunlit trees .
chesterton#Then there fell upon him the great temptation that was to torment him for many days . In the presence of these powerful and repulsive men , who were the princes of anarchy , he had almost forgotten the frail and fanciful figure of the poet Gregory , the mere aesthete of anarchism . He even thought of him now with an old kindness , as if they had played together when children . But he remembered that he was still tied to Gregory by a great promise . He had promised never to do the very thing that he now felt himself almost in the act of doing . He had promised not to jump over that balcony and speak to that policeman .
chesterton#He took his cold hand off the cold stone balustrade . His soul swayed in a vertigo of moral indecision . He had only to snap the thread of a rash vow made to a villainous society , and all his life could be as open and sunny as the square beneath him . He had , on the other hand , only to keep his antiquated honour , and be delivered inch by inch into the power of this great enemy of mankind , whose very intellect was a torture - chamber . Whenever he looked down into the square he saw the comfortable policeman , a pillar of common sense and common order . Whenever he looked back at the breakfast - table he saw the President still quietly studying him with big , unbearable eyes .
chesterton#In all the torrent of his thought there were two thoughts that never crossed his mind . First , it never occurred to him to doubt that the President and his Council could crush him if he continued to stand alone . The place might be public , the project might seem impossible . But Sunday was not the man who would carry himself thus easily without having , somehow or somewhere , set open his iron trap . Either by anonymous poison or sudden street accident , by hypnotism or by fire from hell , Sunday could certainly strike him . If he defied the man he was probably dead , either struck stiff there in his chair or long afterwards as by an innocent ailment .
chesterton#If he called in the police promptly , arrested everyone , told all , and set against them the whole energy of England , he would probably escape ; certainly not otherwise . They were a balconyful of gentlemen overlooking a bright and busy square ; but he felt no more safe with them than if they had been a boatful of armed pirates overlooking an empty sea . There was a second thought that never came to him . It never occurred to him to be spiritually won over to the enemy . Many moderns , inured to a weak worship of intellect and force , might have wavered in their allegiance under this oppression of a great personality . They might have called Sunday the super - man .
chesterton#If any such creature be conceivable , he looked , indeed , somewhat like it , with his earth - shaking abstraction , as of a stone statue walking . He might have been called something above man , with his large plans , which were too obvious to be detected , with his large face , which was too frank to be understood . But this was a kind of modern meanness to which Syme could not sink even in his extreme morbidity . Like any man , he was coward enough to fear great force ; but he was not quite coward enough to admire it . The men were eating as they talked , and even in this they were typical . Dr . Bull and the Marquis ate casually and conventionally of the best things on the table -- cold pheasant or Strasbourg pie .
chesterton#"But the Secretary was a vegetarian , and he spoke earnestly of the projected murder over half a raw tomato and three quarters of a glass of tepid water . The old Professor had such slops as suggested a sickening second childhood . And even in this President Sunday preserved his curious predominance of mere mass . For he ate like twenty men ; he ate incredibly , with a frightful freshness of appetite , so that it was like watching a sausage factory . Yet continually , when he had swallowed a dozen crumpets or drunk a quart of coffee , he would be found with his great head on one side staring at Syme . "" I have often wondered ,"" said the Marquis , taking a great bite out of a slice of bread and jam , "" whether it wouldn ' t be better for me to do it with a knife ."
chesterton#"Most of the best things have been brought off with a knife . And it would be a new emotion to get a knife into a French President and wriggle it round ."" "" You are wrong ,"" said the Secretary , drawing his black brows together . "" The knife was merely the expression of the old personal quarrel with a personal tyrant . Dynamite is not only our best tool , but our best symbol . It is as perfect a symbol of us as is incense of the prayers of the Christians ."
chesterton#"It expands ; it only destroys because it broadens ; even so , thought only destroys because it broadens . A man ' s brain is a bomb ,"" he cried out , loosening suddenly his strange passion and striking his own skull with violence . "" My brain feels like a bomb , night and day . It must expand ! It must expand ! A man ' s brain must expand , if it breaks up the universe ."""
chesterton#""" I don ' t want the universe broken up just yet ,"" drawled the Marquis . "" I want to do a lot of beastly things before I die . I thought of one yesterday in bed ."" "" No , if the only end of the thing is nothing ,"" said Dr . Bull with his sphinx - like smile , "" it hardly seems worth doing ."" The old Professor was staring at the ceiling with dull eyes . "" Every man knows in his heart ,"" he said , "" that nothing is worth doing ."""
chesterton#"There was a singular silence , and then the Secretary said -- "" We are wandering , however , from the point . The only question is how Wednesday is to strike the blow . I take it we should all agree with the original notion of a bomb . As to the actual arrangements , I should suggest that tomorrow morning he should go first of all to --"" The speech was broken off short under a vast shadow ."
chesterton#"President Sunday had risen to his feet , seeming to fill the sky above them . "" Before we discuss that ,"" he said in a small , quiet voice , "" let us go into a private room . I have something vent particular to say ."" Syme stood up before any of the others . The instant of choice had come at last , the pistol was at his head . On the pavement before he could hear the policeman idly stir and stamp , for the morning , though bright , was cold ."
chesterton#A barrel - organ in the street suddenly sprang with a jerk into a jovial tune . Syme stood up taut , as if it had been a bugle before the battle . He found himself filled with a supernatural courage that came from nowhere . That jingling music seemed full of the vivacity , the vulgarity , and the irrational valour of the poor , who in all those unclean streets were all clinging to the decencies and the charities of Christendom . His youthful prank of being a policeman had faded from his mind ; he did not think of himself as the representative of the corps of gentlemen turned into fancy constables , or of the old eccentric who lived in the dark room . But he did feel himself as the ambassador of all these common and kindly people in the street , who every day marched into battle to the music of the barrel - organ .
chesterton#And this high pride in being human had lifted him unaccountably to an infinite height above the monstrous men around him . For an instant , at least , he looked down upon all their sprawling eccentricities from the starry pinnacle of the commonplace . He felt towards them all that unconscious and elementary superiority that a brave man feels over powerful beasts or a wise man over powerful errors . He knew that he had neither the intellectual nor the physical strength of President Sunday ; but in that moment he minded it no more than the fact that he had not the muscles of a tiger or a horn on his nose like a rhinoceros . All was swallowed up in an ultimate certainty that the President was wrong and that the barrel - organ was right . There clanged in his mind that unanswerable and terrible truism in the song of Roland --
chesterton#""" Pagens ont tort et Chretiens ont droit ."" which in the old nasal French has the clang and groan of great iron . This liberation of his spirit from the load of his weakness went with a quite clear decision to embrace death . If the people of the barrel - organ could keep their old - world obligations , so could he . This very pride in keeping his word was that he was keeping it to miscreants . It was his last triumph over these lunatics to go down into their dark room and die for something that they could not even understand ."
chesterton#The barrel - organ seemed to give the marching tune with the energy and the mingled noises of a whole orchestra ; and he could hear deep and rolling , under all the trumpets of the pride of life , the drums of the pride of death . The conspirators were already filing through the open window and into the rooms behind . Syme went last , outwardly calm , but with all his brain and body throbbing with romantic rhythm . The President led them down an irregular side stair , such as might be used by servants , and into a dim , cold , empty room , with a table and benches , like an abandoned boardroom . When they were all in , he closed and locked the door . The first to speak was Gogol , the irreconcilable , who seemed bursting with inarticulate grievance .
chesterton#""" Zso ! Zso !"" he cried , with an obscure excitement , his heavy Polish accent becoming almost impenetrable . "" You zay you nod ' ide . You zay you show himselves . It is all nuzzinks ."
chesterton#"Ven you vant talk importance you run yourselves in a dark box !"" The President seemed to take the foreigner ' s incoherent satire with entire good humour . "" You can ' t get hold of it yet , Gogol ,"" he said in a fatherly way . "" When once they have heard us talking nonsense on that balcony they will not care where we go afterwards . If we had come here first , we should have had the whole staff at the keyhole . You don ' t seem to know anything about mankind ."""
chesterton#""" I die for zem ,"" cried the Pole in thick excitement , "" and I slay zare oppressors . I care not for these games of gonzealment . I would zmite ze tyrant in ze open square ."" "" I see , I see ,"" said the President , nodding kindly as he seated himself at the top of a long table . "" You die for mankind first , and then you get up and smite their oppressors . So that ' s all right ."
chesterton#"And now may I ask you to control your beautiful sentiments , and sit down with the other gentlemen at this table . For the first time this morning something intelligent is going to be said ."" Syme , with the perturbed promptitude he had shown since the original summons , sat down first . Gogol sat down last , grumbling in his brown beard about gombromise . No one except Syme seemed to have any notion of the blow that was about to fall . As for him , he had merely the feeling of a man mounting the scaffold with the intention , at any rate , of making a good speech ."
chesterton#""" Comrades ,"" said the President , suddenly rising , "" we have spun out this farce long enough . I have called you down here to tell you something so simple and shocking that even the waiters upstairs ( long inured to our levities ) might hear some new seriousness in my voice . Comrades , we were discussing plans and naming places . I propose , before saying anything else , that those plans and places should not be voted by this meeting , but should be left wholly in the control of some one reliable member . I suggest Comrade Saturday , Dr . Bull ."""
chesterton#"They all stared at him ; then they all started in their seats , for the next words , though not loud , had a living and sensational emphasis . Sunday struck the table . "" Not one word more about the plans and places must be said at this meeting . Not one tiny detail more about what we mean to do must be mentioned in this company ."" Sunday had spent his life in astonishing his followers ; but it seemed as if he had never really astonished them until now . They all moved feverishly in their seats , except Syme ."
chesterton#"He sat stiff in his , with his hand in his pocket , and on the handle of his loaded revolver . When the attack on him came he would sell his life dear . He would find out at least if the President was mortal . Sunday went on smoothly -- "" You will probably understand that there is only one possible motive for forbidding free speech at this festival of freedom . Strangers overhearing us matters nothing ."
chesterton#"They assume that we are joking . But what would matter , even unto death , is this , that there should be one actually among us who is not of us , who knows our grave purpose , but does not share it , who --"" The Secretary screamed out suddenly like a woman . "" It can ' t be !"" he cried , leaping . "" There can ' t --"""
chesterton#"The President flapped his large flat hand on the table like the fin of some huge fish . "" Yes ,"" he said slowly , "" there is a spy in this room . There is a traitor at this table . I will waste no more words . His name --"" Syme half rose from his seat , his finger firm on the trigger ."
chesterton#""" His name is Gogol ,"" said the President . "" He is that hairy humbug over there who pretends to be a Pole ."" Gogol sprang to his feet , a pistol in each hand . With the same flash three men sprang at his throat . Even the Professor made an effort to rise . But Syme saw little of the scene , for he was blinded with a beneficent darkness ; he had sunk down into his seat shuddering , in a palsy of passionate relief ."
chesterton#"CHAPTER VII THE UNACCOUNTABLE CONDUCT OF PROFESSOR DE WORMS "" SIT down !"" said Sunday in a voice that he used once or twice in his life , a voice that made men drop drawn swords . The three who had risen fell away from Gogol , and that equivocal person himself resumed his seat . "" Well , my man ,"" said the President briskly , addressing him as one addresses a total stranger , "" will you oblige me by putting your hand in your upper waistcoat pocket and showing me what you have there ?"""
chesterton#"The alleged Pole was a little pale under his tangle of dark hair , but he put two fingers into the pocket with apparent coolness and pulled out a blue strip of card . When Syme saw it lying on the table , he woke up again to the world outside him . For although the card lay at the other extreme of the table , and he could read nothing of the inscription on it , it bore a startling resemblance to the blue card in his own pocket , the card which had been given to him when he joined the anti - anarchist constabulary . "" Pathetic Slav ,"" said the President , "" tragic child of Poland , are you prepared in the presence of that card to deny that you are in this company -- shall we say de trop ?"" "" Right oh !"" said the late Gogol ."
chesterton#"It made everyone jump to hear a clear , commercial and somewhat cockney voice coming out of that forest of foreign hair . It was irrational , as if a Chinaman had suddenly spoken with a Scotch accent . "" I gather that you fully understand your position ,"" said Sunday . "" You bet ,"" answered the Pole . "" I see it ' s a fair cop . All I say is , I don ' t believe any Pole could have imitated my accent like I did his ."""
chesterton#""" I concede the point ,"" said Sunday . "" I believe your own accent to be inimitable , though I shall practise it in my bath . Do you mind leaving your beard with your card ?"" "" Not a bit ,"" answered Gogol ; and with one finger he ripped off the whole of his shaggy head - covering , emerging with thin red hair and a pale , pert face . "" It was hot ,"" he added . "" I will do you the justice to say ,"" said Sunday , not without a sort of brutal admiration , "" that you seem to have kept pretty cool under it ."
chesterton#Now listen to me . I like you . The consequence is that it would annoy me for just about two and a half minutes if I heard that you had died in torments . Well , if you ever tell the police or any human soul about us , I shall have that two and a half minutes of discomfort . On your discomfort I will not dwell . Good day .
chesterton#"Mind the step ."" The red - haired detective who had masqueraded as Gogol rose to his feet without a word , and walked out of the room with an air of perfect nonchalance . Yet the astonished Syme was able to realise that this ease was suddenly assumed ; for there was a slight stumble outside the door , which showed that the departing detective had not minded the step . "" Time is flying ,"" said the President in his gayest manner , after glancing at his watch , which like everything about him seemed bigger than it ought to be . "" I must go off at once ; I have to take the chair at a Humanitarian meeting ."" The Secretary turned to him with working eyebrows ."
chesterton#""" Would it not be better ,"" he said a little sharply , "" to discuss further the details of our project , now that the spy has left us ?"" "" No , I think not ,"" said the President with a yawn like an unobtrusive earthquake . "" Leave it as it is . Let Saturday settle it . I must be off . Breakfast here next Sunday ."""
chesterton#"But the late loud scenes had whipped up the almost naked nerves of the Secretary . He was one of those men who are conscientious even in crime . "" I must protest , President , that the thing is irregular ,"" he said . "" It is a fundamental rule of our society that all plans shall be debated in full council . Of course , I fully appreciate your forethought when in the actual presence of a traitor --"" "" Secretary ,"" said the President seriously , "" if you ' d take your head home and boil it for a turnip it might be useful ."
chesterton#"I can ' t say . But it might . The Secretary reared back in a kind of equine anger . "" I really fail to understand --"" he began in high offense . "" That ' s it , that ' s it ,"" said the President , nodding a great many times . "" That ' s where you fail right enough ."
chesterton#"You fail to understand . Why , you dancing donkey ,"" he roared , rising , "" you didn ' t want to be overheard by a spy , didn ' t you ? How do you know you aren ' t overheard now ?"" And with these words he shouldered his way out of the room , shaking with incomprehensible scorn . Four of the men left behind gaped after him without any apparent glimmering of his meaning . Syme alone had even a glimmering , and such as it was it froze him to the bone ."
chesterton#If the last words of the President meant anything , they meant that he had not after all passed unsuspected . They meant that while Sunday could not denounce him like Gogol , he still could not trust him like the others . The other four got to their feet grumbling more or less , and betook themselves elsewhere to find lunch , for it was already well past midday . The Professor went last , very slowly and painfully . Syme sat long after the rest had gone , revolving his strange position . He had escaped a thunderbolt , but he was still under a cloud .
chesterton#At last he rose and made his way out of the hotel into Leicester Square . The bright , cold day had grown increasingly colder , and when he came out into the street he was surprised by a few flakes of snow . While he still carried the sword - stick and the rest of Gregory ' s portable luggage , he had thrown the cloak down and left it somewhere , perhaps on the steam - tug , perhaps on the balcony . Hoping , therefore , that the snow - shower might be slight , he stepped back out of the street for a moment and stood up under the doorway of a small and greasy hair - dresser ' s shop , the front window of which was empty , except for a sickly wax lady in evening dress . Snow , however , began to thicken and fall fast ; and Syme , having found one glance at the wax lady quite sufficient to depress his spirits , stared out instead into the white and empty street . He was considerably astonished to see , standing quite still outside the shop and staring into the window , a man .
chesterton#His top hat was loaded with snow like the hat of Father Christmas , the white drift was rising round his boots and ankles ; but it seemed as if nothing could tear him away from the contemplation of the colourless wax doll in dirty evening dress . That any human being should stand in such weather looking into such a shop was a matter of sufficient wonder to Syme ; but his idle wonder turned suddenly into a personal shock ; for he realised that the man standing there was the paralytic old Professor de Worms . It scarcely seemed the place for a person of his years and infirmities . Syme was ready to believe anything about the perversions of this dehumanized brotherhood ; but even he could not believe that the Professor had fallen in love with that particular wax lady . He could only suppose that the man ' s malady ( whatever it was ) involved some momentary fits of rigidity or trance . He was not inclined , however , to feel in this case any very compassionate concern .
chesterton#On the contrary , he rather congratulated himself that the Professor ' s stroke and his elaborate and limping walk would make it easy to escape from him and leave him miles behind . For Syme thirsted first and last to get clear of the whole poisonous atmosphere , if only for an hour . Then he could collect his thoughts , formulate his policy , and decide finally whether he should or should not keep faith with Gregory . He strolled away through the dancing snow , turned up two or three streets , down through two or three others , and entered a small Soho restaurant for lunch . He partook reflectively of four small and quaint courses , drank half a bottle of red wine , and ended up over black coffee and a black cigar , still thinking . He had taken his seat in the upper room of the restaurant , which was full of the chink of knives and the chatter of foreigners .
chesterton#He remembered that in old days he had imagined that all these harmless and kindly aliens were anarchists . He shuddered , remembering the real thing . But even the shudder had the delightful shame of escape . The wine , the common food , the familiar place , the faces of natural and talkative men , made him almost feel as if the Council of the Seven Days had been a bad dream ; and although he knew it was nevertheless an objective reality , it was at least a distant one . Tall houses and populous streets lay between him and his last sight of the shameful seven ; he was free in free London , and drinking wine among the free . With a somewhat easier action , he took his hat and stick and strolled down the stair into the shop below .
chesterton#"When he entered that lower room he stood stricken and rooted to the spot . At a small table , close up to the blank window and the white street of snow , sat the old anarchist Professor over a glass of milk , with his lifted livid face and pendent eyelids . For an instant Syme stood as rigid as the stick he leant upon . Then with a gesture as of blind hurry , he brushed past the Professor , dashing open the door and slamming it behind him , and stood outside in the snow . "" Can that old corpse be following me ?"" he asked himself , biting his yellow moustache ."
chesterton#""" I stopped too long up in that room , so that even such leaden feet could catch me up . One comfort is , with a little brisk walking I can put a man like that as far away as Timbuctoo . Or am I too fanciful ? Was he really following me ? Surely Sunday would not be such a fool as to send a lame man ? "" He set off at a smart pace , twisting and whirling his stick , in the direction of Covent Garden ."
chesterton#As he crossed the great market the snow increased , growing blinding and bewildering as the afternoon began to darken . The snow - flakes tormented him like a swarm of silver bees . Getting into his eyes and beard , they added their unremitting futility to his already irritated nerves ; and by the time that he had come at a swinging pace to the beginning of Fleet Street , he lost patience , and finding a Sunday teashop , turned into it to take shelter . He ordered another cup of black coffee as an excuse . Scarcely had he done so , when Professor de Worms hobbled heavily into the shop , sat down with difficulty and ordered a glass of milk . Syme ' s walking - stick had fallen from his hand with a great clang , which confessed the concealed steel .
chesterton#But the Professor did not look round . Syme , who was commonly a cool character , was literally gaping as a rustic gapes at a conjuring trick . He had seen no cab following ; he had heard no wheels outside the shop ; to all mortal appearances the man had come on foot . But the old man could only walk like a snail , and Syme had walked like the wind . He started up and snatched his stick , half crazy with the contradiction in mere arithmetic , and swung out of the swinging doors , leaving his coffee untasted . An omnibus going to the Bank went rattling by with an unusual rapidity .
chesterton#He had a violent run of a hundred yards to reach it ; but he managed to spring , swaying upon the splash - board and , pausing for an instant to pant , he climbed on to the top . When he had been seated for about half a minute , he heard behind him a sort of heavy and asthmatic breathing . Turning sharply , he saw rising gradually higher and higher up the omnibus steps a top hat soiled and dripping with snow , and under the shadow of its brim the short - sighted face and shaky shoulders of Professor de Worms . He let himself into a seat with characteristic care , and wrapped himself up to the chin in the mackintosh rug . Every movement of the old man ' s tottering figure and vague hands , every uncertain gesture and panic - stricken pause , seemed to put it beyond question that he was helpless , that he was in the last imbecility of the body . He moved by inches , he let himself down with little gasps of caution .
chesterton#And yet , unless the philosophical entities called time and space have no vestige even of a practical existence , it appeared quite unquestionable that he had run after the omnibus . Syme sprang erect upon the rocking car , and after staring wildly at the wintry sky , that grew gloomier every moment , he ran down the steps . He had repressed an elemental impulse to leap over the side . Too bewildered to look back or to reason , he rushed into one of the little courts at the side of Fleet Street as a rabbit rushes into a hole . He had a vague idea , if this incomprehensible old Jack - in - the - box was really pursuing him , that in that labyrinth of little streets he could soon throw him off the scent . He dived in and out of those crooked lanes , which were more like cracks than thoroughfares ; and by the time that he had completed about twenty alternate angles and described an unthinkable polygon , he paused to listen for any sound of pursuit .
chesterton#There was none ; there could not in any case have been much , for the little streets were thick with the soundless snow . Somewhere behind Red Lion Court , however , he noticed a place where some energetic citizen had cleared away the snow for a space of about twenty yards , leaving the wet , glistening cobble - stones . He thought little of this as he passed it , only plunging into yet another arm of the maze . But when a few hundred yards farther on he stood still again to listen , his heart stood still also , for he heard from that space of rugged stones the clinking crutch and labouring feet of the infernal cripple . The sky above was loaded with the clouds of snow , leaving London in a darkness and oppression premature for that hour of the evening . On each side of Syme the walls of the alley were blind and featureless ; there was no little window or any kind of eve .
chesterton#He felt a new impulse to break out of this hive of houses , and to get once more into the open and lamp - lit street . Yet he rambled and dodged for a long time before he struck the main thoroughfare . When he did so , he struck it much farther up than he had fancied . He came out into what seemed the vast and void of Ludgate Circus , and saw St . Paul ' s Cathedral sitting in the sky . At first he was startled to find these great roads so empty , as if a pestilence had swept through the city . Then he told himself that some degree of emptiness was natural ; first because the snow - storm was even dangerously deep , and secondly because it was Sunday .
chesterton#And at the very word Sunday he bit his lip ; the word was henceforth for hire like some indecent pun . Under the white fog of snow high up in the heaven the whole atmosphere of the city was turned to a very queer kind of green twilight , as of men under the sea . The sealed and sullen sunset behind the dark dome of St . Paul ' s had in it smoky and sinister colours -- colours of sickly green , dead red or decaying bronze , that were just bright enough to emphasise the solid whiteness of the snow . But right up against these dreary colours rose the black bulk of the cathedral ; and upon the top of the cathedral was a random splash and great stain of snow , still clinging as to an Alpine peak . It had fallen accidentally , but just so fallen as to half drape the dome from its very topmost point , and to pick out in perfect silver the great orb and the cross . When Syme saw it he suddenly straightened himself , and made with his sword - stick an involuntary salute .
chesterton#"He knew that that evil figure , his shadow , was creeping quickly or slowly behind him , and he did not care . It seemed a symbol of human faith and valour that while the skies were darkening that high place of the earth was bright . The devils might have captured heaven , but they had not yet captured the cross . He had a new impulse to tear out the secret of this dancing , jumping and pursuing paralytic ; and at the entrance of the court as it opened upon the Circus he turned , stick in hand , to face his pursuer . Professor de Worms came slowly round the corner of the irregular alley behind him , his unnatural form outlined against a lonely gas - lamp , irresistibly recalling that very imaginative figure in the nursery rhymes , "" the crooked man who went a crooked mile ."" He really looked as if he had been twisted out of shape by the tortuous streets he had been threading ."
chesterton#He came nearer and nearer , the lamplight shining on his lifted spectacles , his lifted , patient face . Syme waited for him as St . George waited for the dragon , as a man waits for a final explanation or for death . And the old Professor came right up to him and passed him like a total stranger , without even a blink of his mournful eyelids . There was something in this silent and unexpected innocence that left Syme in a final fury . The man ' s colourless face and manner seemed to assert that the whole following had been an accident . Syme was galvanised with an energy that was something between bitterness and a burst of boyish derision .
chesterton#"He made a wild gesture as if to knock the old man ' s hat off , called out something like "" Catch me if you can ,"" and went racing away across the white , open Circus . Concealment was impossible now ; and looking back over his shoulder , he could see the black figure of the old gentleman coming after him with long , swinging strides like a man winning a mile race . But the head upon that bounding body was still pale , grave and professional , like the head of a lecturer upon the body of a harlequin . This outrageous chase sped across Ludgate Circus , up Ludgate Hill , round St . Paul ' s Cathedral , along Cheapside , Syme remembering all the nightmares he had ever known . Then Syme broke away towards the river , and ended almost down by the docks . He saw the yellow panes of a low , lighted public - house , flung himself into it and ordered beer ."
chesterton#It was a foul tavern , sprinkled with foreign sailors , a place where opium might be smoked or knives drawn . A moment later Professor de Worms entered the place , sat down carefully , and asked for a glass of milk . CHAPTER VIII THE PROFESSOR EXPLAINS WHEN Gabriel Syme found himself finally established in a chair , and opposite to him , fixed and final also , the lifted eyebrows and leaden eyelids of the Professor , his fears fully returned . This incomprehensible man from the fierce council , after all , had certainly pursued him .
chesterton#If the man had one character as a paralytic and another character as a pursuer , the antithesis might make him more interesting , but scarcely more soothing . It would be a very small comfort that he could not find the Professor out , if by some serious accident the Professor should find him out . He emptied a whole pewter pot of ale before the professor had touched his milk . One possibility , however , kept him hopeful and yet helpless . It was just possible that this escapade signified something other than even a slight suspicion of him . Perhaps it was some regular form or sign .
chesterton#"Perhaps the foolish scamper was some sort of friendly signal that he ought to have understood . Perhaps it was a ritual . Perhaps the new Thursday was always chased along Cheapside , as the new Lord Mayor is always escorted along it . He was just selecting a tentative inquiry , when the old Professor opposite suddenly and simply cut him short . Before Syme could ask the first diplomatic question , the old anarchist had asked suddenly , without any sort of preparation -- "" Are you a policeman ?"""
chesterton#"Whatever else Syme had expected , he had never expected anything so brutal and actual as this . Even his great presence of mind could only manage a reply with an air of rather blundering jocularity . "" A policeman ?"" he said , laughing vaguely . "" Whatever made you think of a policeman in connection with me ?"" "" The process was simple enough ,"" answered the Professor patiently ."
chesterton#""" I thought you looked like a policeman . I think so now ."" "" Did I take a policeman ' s hat by mistake out of the restaurant ?"" asked Syme , smiling wildly . "" Have I by any chance got a number stuck on to me somewhere ? Have my boots got that watchful look ?"
chesterton#"Why must I be a policeman ? Do , do let me be a postman ."" The old Professor shook his head with a gravity that gave no hope , but Syme ran on with a feverish irony . "" But perhaps I misunderstood the delicacies of your German philosophy . Perhaps policeman is a relative term . In an evolutionary sense , sir , the ape fades so gradually into the policeman , that I myself can never detect the shade ."
chesterton#"The monkey is only the policeman that may be . Perhaps a maiden lady on Clapham Common is only the policeman that might have been . I don ' t mind being the policeman that might have been . I don ' t mind being anything in German thought ."" "" Are you in the police service ?"" said the old man , ignoring all Syme ' s improvised and desperate raillery ."
chesterton#""" Are you a detective ?"" Syme ' s heart turned to stone , but his face never changed . "" Your suggestion is ridiculous ,"" he began . "" Why on earth --"" The old man struck his palsied hand passionately on the rickety table , nearly breaking it . "" Did you hear me ask a plain question , you pattering spy ?"""
chesterton#"he shrieked in a high , crazy voice . "" Are you , or are you not , a police detective ?"" "" No !"" answered Syme , like a man standing on the hangman ' s drop . "" You swear it ,"" said the old man , leaning across to him , his dead face becoming as it were loathsomely alive . "" You swear it !"
chesterton#You swear it ! If you swear falsely , will you be damned ? Will you be sure that the devil dances at your funeral ? Will you see that the nightmare sits on your grave ? Will there really be no mistake ? You are an anarchist , you are a dynamiter !
chesterton#"Above all , you are not in any sense a detective ? You are not in the British police ?"" He leant his angular elbow far across the table , and put up his large loose hand like a flap to his ear . "" I am not in the British police ,"" said Syme with insane calm . Professor de Worms fell back in his chair with a curious air of kindly collapse . "" That ' s a pity ,"" he said , "" because I am ."""
chesterton#"Syme sprang up straight , sending back the bench behind him with a crash . "" Because you are what ?"" he said thickly . "" You are what ?"" "" I am a policeman ,"" said the Professor with his first broad smile . and beaming through his spectacles ."
chesterton#""" But as you think policeman only a relative term , of course I have nothing to do with you . I am in the British police force ; but as you tell me you are not in the British police force , I can only say that I met you in a dynamiters ' club . I suppose I ought to arrest you ."" And with these words he laid on the table before Syme an exact facsimile of the blue card which Syme had in his own waistcoat pocket , the symbol of his power from the police . Syme had for a flash the sensation that the cosmos had turned exactly upside down , that all trees were growing downwards and that all stars were under his feet . Then came slowly the opposite conviction ."
chesterton#For the last twenty - four hours the cosmos had really been upside down , but now the capsized universe had come right side up again . This devil from whom he had been fleeing all day was only an elder brother of his own house , who on the other side of the table lay back and laughed at him . He did not for the moment ask any questions of detail ; he only knew the happy and silly fact that this shadow , which had pursued him with an intolerable oppression of peril , was only the shadow of a friend trying to catch him up . He knew simultaneously that he was a fool and a free man . For with any recovery from morbidity there must go a certain healthy humiliation . There comes a certain point in such conditions when only three things are possible : first a perpetuation of Satanic pride , secondly tears , and third laughter .
chesterton#"Syme ' s egotism held hard to the first course for a few seconds , and then suddenly adopted the third . Taking his own blue police ticket from his own waist coat pocket , he tossed it on to the table ; then he flung his head back until his spike of yellow beard almost pointed at the ceiling , and shouted with a barbaric laughter . Even in that close den , perpetually filled with the din of knives , plates , cans , clamorous voices , sudden struggles and stampedes , there was something Homeric in Syme ' s mirth which made many half - drunken men look round . "" What yer laughing at , guv ' nor ?"" asked one wondering labourer from the docks . "" At myself ,"" answered Syme , and went off again into the agony of his ecstatic reaction ."
chesterton#""" Pull yourself together ,"" said the Professor , "" or you ' ll get hysterical . Have some more beer . I ' ll join you ."" "" You haven ' t drunk your milk ,"" said Syme . "" My milk !"" said the other , in tones of withering and unfathomable contempt , "" my milk !"
chesterton#"Do you think I ' d look at the beastly stuff when I ' m out of sight of the bloody anarchists ? We ' re all Christians in this room , though perhaps ,"" he added , glancing around at the reeling crowd , "" not strict ones . Finish my milk ? Great blazes ! yes , I ' ll finish it right enough !"" and he knocked the tumbler off the table , making a crash of glass and a splash of silver fluid ."
chesterton#"Syme was staring at him with a happy curiosity . "" I understand now ,"" he cried ; "" of course , you ' re not an old man at all ."" "" I can ' t take my face off here ,"" replied Professor de Worms . "" It ' s rather an elaborate make - up . As to whether I ' m an old man , that ' s not for me to say . I was thirty - eight last birthday ."""
chesterton#""" Yes , but I mean ,"" said Syme impatiently , "" there ' s nothing the matter with you ."" "" Yes ,"" answered the other dispassionately . "" I am subject to colds ."" Syme ' s laughter at all this had about it a wild weakness of relief . He laughed at the idea of the paralytic Professor being really a young actor dressed up as if for the foot - lights . But he felt that he would have laughed as loudly if a pepperpot had fallen over ."
chesterton#"The false Professor drank and wiped his false beard . "" Did you know ,"" he asked , "" that that man Gogol was one of us ?"" "" I ? No , I didn ' t know it ,"" answered Syme in some surprise . "" But didn ' t you ?"" "" I knew no more than the dead ,"" replied the man who called himself de Worms ."
chesterton#""" I thought the President was talking about me , and I rattled in my boots ."" "" And I thought he was talking about me ,"" said Syme , with his rather reckless laughter . "" I had my hand on my revolver all the time ."" "" So had I ,"" said the Professor grimly ; "" so had Gogol evidently ."" Syme struck the table with an exclamation . "" Why , there were three of us there !"""
chesterton#"he cried . "" Three out of seven is a fighting number . If we had only known that we were three !"" The face of Professor de Worms darkened , and he did not look up . "" We were three ,"" he said . "" If we had been three hundred we could still have done nothing ."""
chesterton#""" Not if we were three hundred against four ?"" asked Syme , jeering rather boisterously . "" No ,"" said the Professor with sobriety , "" not if we were three hundred against Sunday ."" And the mere name struck Syme cold and serious ; his laughter had died in his heart before it could die on his lips . The face of the unforgettable President sprang into his mind as startling as a coloured photograph , and he remarked this difference between Sunday and all his satellites , that their faces , however fierce or sinister , became gradually blurred by memory like other human faces , whereas Sunday ' s seemed almost to grow more actual during absence , as if a man ' s painted portrait should slowly come alive . They were both silent for a measure of moments , and then Syme ' s speech came with a rush , like the sudden foaming of champagne ."
chesterton#""" Professor ,"" he cried , "" it is intolerable . Are you afraid of this man ?"" The Professor lifted his heavy lids , and gazed at Syme with large , wide - open , blue eyes of an almost ethereal honesty . "" Yes , I am ,"" he said mildly . "" So are you ."" Syme was dumb for an instant ."
chesterton#"Then he rose to his feet erect , like an insulted man , and thrust the chair away from him . "" Yes ,"" he said in a voice indescribable , "" you are right . I am afraid of him . Therefore I swear by God that I will seek out this man whom I fear until I find him , and strike him on the mouth . If heaven were his throne and the earth his footstool , I swear that I would pull him down ."" "" How ?"""
chesterton#"asked the staring Professor . "" Why ?"" "" Because I am afraid of him ,"" said Syme ; "" and no man should leave in the universe anything of which he is afraid ."" De Worms blinked at him with a sort of blind wonder . He made an effort to speak , but Syme went on in a low voice , but with an undercurrent of inhuman exaltation -- "" Who would condescend to strike down the mere things that he does not fear ?"
chesterton#"Who would debase himself to be merely brave , like any common prizefighter ? Who would stoop to be fearless -- like a tree ? Fight the thing that you fear . You remember the old tale of the English clergyman who gave the last rites to the brigand of Sicily , and how on his death - bed the great robber said , ' I can give you no money , but I can give you advice for a lifetime : your thumb on the blade , and strike upwards .' So I say to you , strike upwards , if you strike at the stars ."" The other looked at the ceiling , one of the tricks of his pose ."
chesterton#""" Sunday is a fixed star ,"" he said . "" You shall see him a falling star ,"" said Syme , and put on his hat . The decision of his gesture drew the Professor vaguely to his feet . "" Have you any idea ,"" he asked , with a sort of benevolent bewilderment , "" exactly where you are going ?"" "" Yes ,"" replied Syme shortly , "" I am going to prevent this bomb being thrown in Paris ."" "" Have you any conception how ?"""
chesterton#"inquired the other . "" No ,"" said Syme with equal decision . "" You remember , of course ,"" resumed the soi - disant de Worms , pulling his beard and looking out of the window , "" that when we broke up rather hurriedly the whole arrangements for the atrocity were left in the private hands of the Marquis and Dr . Bull . The Marquis is by this time probably crossing the Channel . But where he will go and what he will do it is doubtful whether even the President knows ; certainly we don ' t know . The only man who does know is Dr . Bull ."
chesterton#""" Confound it !"" cried Syme . "" And we don ' t know where he is ."" "" Yes ,"" said the other in his curious , absent - minded way , "" I know where he is myself ."" "" Will you tell me ?"" asked Syme with eager eyes ."
chesterton#""" I will take you there ,"" said the Professor , and took down his own hat from a peg . Syme stood looking at him with a sort of rigid excitement . "" What do you mean ?"" he asked sharply . "" Will you join me ? Will you take the risk ?"""
chesterton#""" Young man ,"" said the Professor pleasantly , "" I am amused to observe that you think I am a coward . As to that I will say only one word , and that shall be entirely in the manner of your own philosophical rhetoric . You think that it is possible to pull down the President . I know that it is impossible , and I am going to try it ,"" and opening the tavern door , which let in a blast of bitter air , they went out together into the dark streets by the docks . Most of the snow was melted or trampled to mud , but here and there a clot of it still showed grey rather than white in the gloom . The small streets were sloppy and full of pools , which reflected the flaming lamps irregularly , and by accident , like fragments of some other and fallen world ."
chesterton#"Syme felt almost dazed as he stepped through this growing confusion of lights and shadows ; but his companion walked on with a certain briskness , towards where , at the end of the street , an inch or two of the lamplit river looked like a bar of flame . "" Where are you going ?"" Syme inquired . "" Just now ,"" answered the Professor , "" I am going just round the corner to see whether Dr . Bull has gone to bed . He is hygienic , and retires early ."" "" Dr ."
chesterton#"Bull !"" exclaimed Syme . "" Does he live round the corner ?"" "" No ,"" answered his friend . "" As a matter of fact he lives some way off , on the other side of the river , but we can tell from here whether he has gone to bed ."" Turning the corner as he spoke , and facing the dim river , flecked with flame , he pointed with his stick to the other bank ."
chesterton#"On the Surrey side at this point there ran out into the Thames , seeming almost to overhang it , a bulk and cluster of those tall tenements , dotted with lighted windows , and rising like factory chimneys to an almost insane height . Their special poise and position made one block of buildings especially look like a Tower of Babel with a hundred eyes . Syme had never seen any of the sky - scraping buildings in America , so he could only think of the buildings in a dream . Even as he stared , the highest light in this innumerably lighted turret abruptly went out , as if this black Argus had winked at him with one of his innumerable eyes . Professor de Worms swung round on his heel , and struck his stick against his boot . "" We are too late ,"" he said , "" the hygienic Doctor has gone to bed ."""
chesterton#""" What do you mean ?"" asked Syme . "" Does he live over there , then ?"" "" Yes ,"" said de Worms , "" behind that particular window which you can ' t see . Come along and get some dinner . We must call on him tomorrow morning ."""
chesterton#"Without further parley , he led the way through several by - ways until they came out into the flare and clamour of the East India Dock Road . The Professor , who seemed to know his way about the neighbourhood , proceeded to a place where the line of lighted shops fell back into a sort of abrupt twilight and quiet , in which an old white inn , all out of repair , stood back some twenty feet from the road . "" You can find good English inns left by accident everywhere , like fossils ,"" explained the Professor . "" I once found a decent place in the West End ."" "" I suppose ,"" said Syme , smiling , "" that this is the corresponding decent place in the East End ?"" "" It is ,"" said the Professor reverently , and went in ."
chesterton#In that place they dined and slept , both very thoroughly . The beans and bacon , which these unaccountable people cooked well , the astonishing emergence of Burgundy from their cellars , crowned Syme ' s sense of a new comradeship and comfort . Through all this ordeal his root horror had been isolation , and there are no words to express the abyss between isolation and having one ally . It may be conceded to the mathematicians that four is twice two . But two is not twice one ; two is two thousand times one . That is why , in spite of a hundred disadvantages , the world will always return to monogamy .
chesterton#"Syme was able to pour out for the first time the whole of his outrageous tale , from the time when Gregory had taken him to the little tavern by the river . He did it idly and amply , in a luxuriant monologue , as a man speaks with very old friends . On his side , also , the man who had impersonated Professor de Worms was not less communicative . His own story was almost as silly as Syme ' s . "" That ' s a good get - up of yours ,"" said Syme , draining a glass of Macon ; "" a lot better than old Gogol ' s . Even at the start I thought he was a bit too hairy ."""
chesterton#""" A difference of artistic theory ,"" replied the Professor pensively . "" Gogol was an idealist . He made up as the abstract or platonic ideal of an anarchist . But I am a realist . I am a portrait painter . But , indeed , to say that I am a portrait painter is an inadequate expression ."
chesterton#"I am a portrait ."" "" I don ' t understand you ,"" said Syme . "" I am a portrait ,"" repeated the Professor . "" I am a portrait of the celebrated Professor de Worms , who is , I believe , in Naples ."" "" You mean you are made up like him ,"" said Syme . "" But doesn ' t he know that you are taking his nose in vain ?"""
chesterton#""" He knows it right enough ,"" replied his friend cheerfully . "" Then why doesn ' t he denounce you ?"" "" I have denounced him ,"" answered the Professor . "" Do explain yourself ,"" said Syme . "" With pleasure , if you don ' t mind hearing my story ,"" replied the eminent foreign philosopher . "" I am by profession an actor , and my name is Wilks ."
chesterton#When I was on the stage I mixed with all sorts of Bohemian and blackguard company . Sometimes I touched the edge of the turf , sometimes the riff - raff of the arts , and occasionally the political refugee . In some den of exiled dreamers I was introduced to the great German Nihilist philosopher , Professor de Worms . I did not gather much about him beyond his appearance , which was very disgusting , and which I studied carefully . I understood that he had proved that the destructive principle in the universe was God ; hence he insisted on the need for a furious and incessant energy , rending all things in pieces . Energy , he said , was the All .
chesterton#He was lame , shortsighted , and partially paralytic . When I met him I was in a frivolous mood , and I disliked him so much that I resolved to imitate him . If I had been a draughtsman I would have drawn a caricature . I was only an actor , I could only act a caricature . I made myself up into what was meant for a wild exaggeration of the old Professor ' s dirty old self . When I went into the room full of his supporters I expected to be received with a roar of laughter , or ( if they were too far gone ) with a roar of indignation at the insult .
chesterton#I cannot describe the surprise I felt when my entrance was received with a respectful silence , followed ( when I had first opened my lips ) with a murmur of admiration . The curse of the perfect artist had fallen upon me . I had been too subtle , I had been too true . They thought I really was the great Nihilist Professor . I was a healthy - minded young man at the time , and I confess that it was a blow . Before I could fully recover , however , two or three of these admirers ran up to me radiating indignation , and told me that a public insult had been put upon me in the next room .
chesterton#"I inquired its nature . It seemed that an impertinent fellow had dressed himself up as a preposterous parody of myself . I had drunk more champagne than was good for me , and in a flash of folly I decided to see the situation through . Consequently it was to meet the glare of the company and my own lifted eyebrows and freezing eyes that the real Professor came into the room . "" I need hardly say there was a collision . The pessimists all round me looked anxiously from one Professor to the other Professor to see which was really the more feeble ."
chesterton#But I won . An old man in poor health , like my rival , could not be expected to be so impressively feeble as a young actor in the prime of life . You see , he really had paralysis , and working within this definite limitation , he couldn ' t be so jolly paralytic as I was . Then he tried to blast my claims intellectually . I countered that by a very simple dodge . Whenever he said something that nobody but he could understand , I replied with something which I could not even understand myself .
chesterton#' I don ' t fancy ,' he said , ' that you could have worked out the principle that evolution is only negation , since there inheres in it the introduction of lacuna , which are an essential of differentiation .' I replied quite scornfully , ' You read all that up in Pinckwerts ; the notion that involution functioned eugenically was exposed long ago by Glumpe .' It is unnecessary for me to say that there never were such people as Pinckwerts and Glumpe . But the people all round ( rather to my surprise ) seemed to remember them quite well , and the Professor , finding that the learned and mysterious method left him rather at the mercy of an enemy slightly deficient in scruples , fell back upon a more popular form of wit . ' I see ,' he sneered , ' you prevail like the false pig in Aesop .' ' And you fail ,' I answered , smiling , ' like the hedgehog in Montaigne .'
chesterton#Need I say that there is no hedgehog in Montaigne ? ' Your claptrap comes off ,' he said ; ' so would your beard .' I had no intelligent answer to this , which was quite true and rather witty . But I laughed heartily , answered , ' Like the Pantheist ' s boots ,' at random , and turned on my heel with all the honours of victory . The real Professor was thrown out , but not with violence , though one man tried very patiently to pull off his nose . He is now , I believe , received everywhere in Europe as a delightful impostor .
chesterton#"His apparent earnestness and anger , you see , make him all the more entertaining ."" "" Well ,"" said Syme , "" I can understand your putting on his dirty old beard for a night ' s practical joke , but I don ' t understand your never taking it off again ."" "" That is the rest of the story ,"" said the impersonator . "" When I myself left the company , followed by reverent applause , I went limping down the dark street , hoping that I should soon be far enough away to be able to walk like a human being . To my astonishment , as I was turning the corner , I felt a touch on the shoulder , and turning , found myself under the shadow of an enormous policeman . He told me I was wanted ."
chesterton#I struck a sort of paralytic attitude , and cried in a high German accent , ' Yes , I am wanted -- by the oppressed of the world . You are arresting me on the charge of being the great anarchist , Professor de Worms .' The policeman impassively consulted a paper in his hand , ' No , sir ,' he said civilly , ' at least , not exactly , sir . I am arresting you on the charge of not being the celebrated anarchist , Professor de Worms .' This charge , if it was criminal at all , was certainly the lighter of the two , and I went along with the man , doubtful , but not greatly dismayed . I was shown into a number of rooms , and eventually into the presence of a police officer , who explained that a serious campaign had been opened against the centres of anarchy , and that this , my successful masquerade , might be of considerable value to the public safety .
chesterton#"He offered me a good salary and this little blue card . Though our conversation was short , he struck me as a man of very massive common sense and humour ; but I cannot tell you much about him personally , because --"" Syme laid down his knife and fork . "" I know ,"" he said , "" because you talked to him in a dark room ."" Professor de Worms nodded and drained his glass . CHAPTER IX"
chesterton#"THE MAN IN SPECTACLES "" BURGUNDY is a jolly thing ,"" said the Professor sadly , as he set his glass down . "" You don ' t look as if it were ,"" said Syme ; "" you drink it as if it were medicine ."" "" You must excuse my manner ,"" said the Professor dismally , "" my position is rather a curious one . Inside I am really bursting with boyish merriment ; but I acted the paralytic Professor so well , that now I can ' t leave off . So that when I am among friends , and have no need at all to disguise myself , I still can ' t help speaking slow and wrinkling my forehead -- just as if it were my forehead ."
chesterton#"I can be quite happy , you understand , but only in a paralytic sort of way . The most buoyant exclamations leap up in my heart , but they come out of my mouth quite different . You should hear me say , ' Buck up , old cock !' It would bring tears to your eyes ."" "" It does ,"" said Syme ; "" but I cannot help thinking that apart from all that you are really a bit worried ."" The Professor started a little and looked at him steadily ."
chesterton#""" You are a very clever fellow ,"" he said , "" it is a pleasure to work with you . Yes , I have rather a heavy cloud in my head . There is a great problem to face ,"" and he sank his bald brow in his two hands . Then he said in a low voice -- "" Can you play the piano ?"" "" Yes ,"" said Syme in simple wonder , "" I ' m supposed to have a good touch ."""
chesterton#"Then , as the other did not speak , he added -- "" I trust the great cloud is lifted ."" After a long silence , the Professor said out of the cavernous shadow of his hands -- "" It would have done just as well if you could work a typewriter ."" "" Thank you ,"" said Syme , "" you flatter me ."" "" Listen to me ,"" said the other , "" and remember whom we have to see tomorrow ."
chesterton#You and I are going tomorrow to attempt something which is very much more dangerous than trying to steal the Crown Jewels out of the Tower . We are trying to steal a secret from a very sharp , very strong , and very wicked man . I believe there is no man , except the President , of course , who is so seriously startling and formidable as that little grinning fellow in goggles . He has not perhaps the white - hot enthusiasm unto death , the mad martyrdom for anarchy , which marks the Secretary . But then that very fanaticism in the Secretary has a human pathos , and is almost a redeeming trait . But the little Doctor has a brutal sanity that is more shocking than the Secretary ' s disease .
chesterton#"Don ' t you notice his detestable virility and vitality . He bounces like an india - rubber ball . Depend on it , Sunday was not asleep ( I wonder if he ever sleeps ?) when he locked up all the plans of this outrage in the round , black head of Dr . Bull ."" "" And you think ,"" said Syme , "" that this unique monster will be soothed if I play the piano to him ?"""
chesterton#""" Don ' t be an ass ,"" said his mentor . "" I mentioned the piano because it gives one quick and independent fingers . Syme , if we are to go through this interview and come out sane or alive , we must have some code of signals between us that this brute will not see . I have made a rough alphabetical cypher corresponding to the five fingers -- like this , see ,"" and he rippled with his fingers on the wooden table --"" B A D , bad , a word we may frequently require ."" Syme poured himself out another glass of wine , and began to study the scheme . He was abnormally quick with his brains at puzzles , and with his hands at conjuring , and it did not take him long to learn how he might convey simple messages by what would seem to be idle taps upon a table or knee ."
chesterton#"But wine and companionship had always the effect of inspiring him to a farcical ingenuity , and the Professor soon found himself struggling with the too vast energy of the new language , as it passed through the heated brain of Syme . "" We must have several word - signs ,"" said Syme seriously --"" words that we are likely to want , fine shades of meaning . My favourite word is ' coeval '. What ' s yours ?"" "" Do stop playing the goat ,"" said the Professor plaintively . "" You don ' t know how serious this is ."""
chesterton#"""' Lush ' too ,"" said Syme , shaking his head sagaciously , "" we must have ' lush '-- word applied to grass , don ' t you know ?"" "" Do you imagine ,"" asked the Professor furiously , "" that we are going to talk to Dr . Bull about grass ?"" "" There are several ways in which the subject could be approached ,"" said Syme reflectively , "" and the word introduced without appearing forced . We might say , ' Dr . Bull , as a revolutionist , you remember that a tyrant once advised us to eat grass ; and indeed many of us , looking on the fresh lush grass of summer ""' "" Do you understand ,"" said the other , "" that this is a tragedy ?"""
chesterton#""" Perfectly ,"" replied Syme ; "" always be comic in a tragedy . What the deuce else can you do ? I wish this language of yours had a wider scope . I suppose we could not extend it from the fingers to the toes ? That would involve pulling off our boots and socks during the conversation , which however unobtrusively performed --"" "" Syme ,"" said his friend with a stern simplicity , "" go to bed !"""
chesterton#"Syme , however , sat up in bed for a considerable time mastering the new code . He was awakened next morning while the east was still sealed with darkness , and found his grey - bearded ally standing like a ghost beside his bed . Syme sat up in bed blinking ; then slowly collected his thoughts , threw off the bed - clothes , and stood up . It seemed to him in some curious way that all the safety and sociability of the night before fell with the bedclothes off him , and he stood up in an air of cold danger . He still felt an entire trust and loyalty towards his companion ; but it was the trust between two men going to the scaffold . "" Well ,"" said Syme with a forced cheerfulness as he pulled on his trousers , "" I dreamt of that alphabet of yours ."
chesterton#"Did it take you long to make it up ?"" The Professor made no answer , but gazed in front of him with eyes the colour of a wintry sea ; so Syme repeated his question . "" I say , did it take you long to invent all this ? I ' m considered good at these things , and it was a good hour ' s grind . Did you learn it all on the spot ?"" The Professor was silent ; his eyes were wide open , and he wore a fixed but very small smile ."
chesterton#""" How long did it take you ?"" The Professor did not move . "" Confound you , can ' t you answer ?"" called out Syme , in a sudden anger that had something like fear underneath . Whether or no the Professor could answer , he did not . Syme stood staring back at the stiff face like parchment and the blank , blue eyes ."
chesterton#His first thought was that the Professor had gone mad , but his second thought was more frightful . After all , what did he know about this queer creature whom he had heedlessly accepted as a friend ? What did he know , except that the man had been at the anarchist breakfast and had told him a ridiculous tale ? How improbable it was that there should be another friend there beside Gogol ! Was this man ' s silence a sensational way of declaring war ? Was this adamantine stare after all only the awful sneer of some threefold traitor , who had turned for the last time ?
chesterton#"He stood and strained his ears in this heartless silence . He almost fancied he could hear dynamiters come to capture him shifting softly in the corridor outside . Then his eye strayed downwards , and he burst out laughing . Though the Professor himself stood there as voiceless as a statue , his five dumb fingers were dancing alive upon the dead table . Syme watched the twinkling movements of the talking hand , and read clearly the message -- "" I will only talk like this ."
chesterton#"We must get used to it ."" He rapped out the answer with the impatience of relief -- "" All right . Let ' s get out to breakfast ."" They took their hats and sticks in silence ; but as Syme took his sword - stick , he held it hard . They paused for a few minutes only to stuff down coffee and coarse thick sandwiches at a coffee stall , and then made their way across the river , which under the grey and growing light looked as desolate as Acheron ."
chesterton#They reached the bottom of the huge block of buildings which they had seen from across the river , and began in silence to mount the naked and numberless stone steps , only pausing now and then to make short remarks on the rail of the banisters . At about every other flight they passed a window ; each window showed them a pale and tragic dawn lifting itself laboriously over London . From each the innumerable roofs of slate looked like the leaden surges of a grey , troubled sea after rain . Syme was increasingly conscious that his new adventure had somehow a quality of cold sanity worse than the wild adventures of the past . Last night , for instance , the tall tenements had seemed to him like a tower in a dream . As he now went up the weary and perpetual steps , he was daunted and bewildered by their almost infinite series .
chesterton#But it was not the hot horror of a dream or of anything that might be exaggeration or delusion . Their infinity was more like the empty infinity of arithmetic , something unthinkable , yet necessary to thought . Or it was like the stunning statements of astronomy about the distance of the fixed stars . He was ascending the house of reason , a thing more hideous than unreason itself . By the time they reached Dr . Bull ' s landing , a last window showed them a harsh , white dawn edged with banks of a kind of coarse red , more like red clay than red cloud . And when they entered Dr . Bull ' s bare garret it was full of light .
chesterton#Syme had been haunted by a half historic memory in connection with these empty rooms and that austere daybreak . The moment he saw the garret and Dr . Bull sitting writing at a table , he remembered what the memory was -- the French Revolution . There should have been the black outline of a guillotine against that heavy red and white of the morning . Dr . Bull was in his white shirt and black breeches only ; his cropped , dark head might well have just come out of its wig ; he might have been Marat or a more slipshod Robespierre . Yet when he was seen properly , the French fancy fell away . The Jacobins were idealists ; there was about this man a murderous materialism .
chesterton#His Dosition gave him a somewhat new appearance . The strong , white light of morning coming from one side creating sharp shadows , made him seem both more pale and more angular than he had looked at the breakfast on the balcony . Thus the two black glasses that encased his eyes might really have been black cavities in his skull , making him look like a death ' s - head . And , indeed , if ever Death himself sat writing at a wooden table , it might have been he . He looked up and smiled brightly enough as the men came in , and rose with the resilient rapidity of which the Professor had spoken . He set chairs for both of them , and going to a peg behind the door , proceeded to put on a coat and waistcoat of rough , dark tweed ; he buttoned it up neatly , and came back to sit down at his table .
chesterton#"The quiet good humour of his manner left his two opponents helpless . It was with some momentary difficulty that the Professor broke silence and began , "" I ' m sorry to disturb you so early , comrade ,"" said he , with a careful resumption of the slow de Worms manner . "" You have no doubt made all the arrangements for the Paris affair ?"" Then he added with infinite slowness , "" We have information which renders intolerable anything in the nature of a moment ' s delay ."" Dr . Bull smiled again , but continued to gaze on them without speaking . The Professor resumed , a pause before each weary word --"
chesterton#""" Please do not think me excessively abrupt ; but I advise you to alter those plans , or if it is too late for that , to follow your agent with all the support you can get for him . Comrade Syme and I have had an experience which it would take more time to recount than we can afford , if we are to act on it . I will , however , relate the occurrence in detail , even at the risk of losing time , if you really feel that it is essential to the understanding of the problem we have to discuss ."" He was spinning out his sentences , making them intolerably long and lingering , in the hope of maddening the practical little Doctor into an explosion of impatience which might show his hand . But the little Doctor continued only to stare and smile , and the monologue was uphill work . Syme began to feel a new sickness and despair ."
chesterton#The Doctor ' s smile and silence were not at all like the cataleptic stare and horrible silence which he had confronted in the Professor half an hour before . About the Professor ' s makeup and all his antics there was always something merely grotesque , like a gollywog . Syme remembered those wild woes of yesterday as one remembers being afraid of Bogy in childhood . But here was daylight ; here was a healthy , square - shouldered man in tweeds , not odd save for the accident of his ugly spectacles , not glaring or grinning at all , but smiling steadily and not saying a word . The whole had a sense of unbearable reality . Under the increasing sunlight the colours of the Doctor ' s complexion , the pattern of his tweeds , grew and expanded outrageously , as such things grow too important in a realistic novel .
chesterton#"But his smile was quite slight , the pose of his head polite ; the only uncanny thing was his silence . "" As I say ,"" resumed the Professor , like a man toiling through heavy sand , "" the incident that has occurred to us and has led us to ask for information about the Marquis , is one which you may think it better to have narrated ; but as it came in the way of Comrade Syme rather than me --"" His words he seemed to be dragging out like words in an anthem ; but Syme , who was watching , saw his long fingers rattle quickly on the edge of the crazy table . He read the message , "" You must go on . This devil has sucked me dry !"" Syme plunged into the breach with that bravado of improvisation which always came to him when he was alarmed ."
chesterton#""" Yes , the thing really happened to me ,"" he said hastily . "" I had the good fortune to fall into conversation with a detective who took me , thanks to my hat , for a respectable person . Wishing to clinch my reputation for respectability , I took him and made him very drunk at the Savoy . Under this influence he became friendly , and told me in so many words that within a day or two they hope to arrest the Marquis in France . So unless you or I can get on his track --"" The Doctor was still smiling in the most friendly way , and his protected eyes were still impenetrable ."
chesterton#"The Professor signalled to Syme that he would resume his explanation , and he began again with the same elaborate calm . "" Syme immediately brought this information to me , and we came here together to see what use you would be inclined to make of it . It seems to me unquestionably urgent that --"" All this time Syme had been staring at the Doctor almost as steadily as the Doctor stared at the Professor , but quite without the smile . The nerves of both comrades - in - arms were near snapping under that strain of motionless amiability , when Syme suddenly leant forward and idly tapped the edge of the table . His message to his ally ran , "" I have an intuition ."""
chesterton#"The Professor , with scarcely a pause in his monologue , signalled back , "" Then sit on it ."" Syme telegraphed , "" It is quite extraordinary ."" The other answered , "" Extraordinary rot !"" Syme said , "" I am a poet ."" The other retorted , "" You are a dead man ."" Syme had gone quite red up to his yellow hair , and his eyes were burning feverishly ."
chesterton#"As he said he had an intuition , and it had risen to a sort of lightheaded certainty . Resuming his symbolic taps , he signalled to his friend , "" You scarcely realise how poetic my intuition is . It has that sudden quality we sometimes feel in the coming of spring ."" He then studied the answer on his friend ' s fingers . The answer was , "" Go to hell ! "" The Professor then resumed his merely verbal monologue addressed to the Doctor ."
chesterton#""" Perhaps I should rather say ,"" said Syme on his fingers , "" that it resembles that sudden smell of the sea which may be found in the heart of lush woods ."" His companion disdained to reply . "" Or yet again ,"" tapped Syme , "" it is positive , as is the passionate red hair of a beautiful woman ."" The Professor was continuing his speech , but in the middle of it Syme decided to act . He leant across the table , and said in a voice that could not be neglected -- "" Dr ."
chesterton#"Bull !"" The Doctor ' s sleek and smiling head did not move , but they could have sworn that under his dark glasses his eyes darted towards Syme . "" Dr . Bull ,"" said Syme , in a voice peculiarly precise and courteous , "" would you do me a small favour ? Would you be so kind as to take off your spectacles ?"" The Professor swung round on his seat , and stared at Syme with a sort of frozen fury of astonishment . Syme , like a man who has thrown his life and fortune on the table , leaned forward with a fiery face ."
chesterton#The Doctor did not move . For a few seconds there was a silence in which one could hear a pin drop , split once by the single hoot of a distant steamer on the Thames . Then Dr . Bull rose slowly , still smiling , and took off his spectacles . Syme sprang to his feet , stepping backwards a little , like a chemical lecturer from a successful explosion . His eyes were like stars , and for an instant he could only point without speaking . The Professor had also started to his feet , forgetful of his supposed paralysis .
chesterton#"He leant on the back of the chair and stared doubtfully at Dr . Bull , as if the Doctor had been turned into a toad before his eyes . And indeed it was almost as great a transformation scene . The two detectives saw sitting in the chair before them a very boyish - looking young man , with very frank and happy hazel eyes , an open expression , cockney clothes like those of a city clerk , and an unquestionable breath about him of being very good and rather commonplace . The smile was still there , but it might have been the first smile of a baby . "" I knew I was a poet ,"" cried Syme in a sort of ecstasy . "" I knew my intuition was as infallible as the Pope ."
chesterton#"It was the spectacles that did it ! It was all the spectacles . Given those beastly black eyes , and all the rest of him his health and his jolly looks , made him a live devil among dead ones ."" "" It certainly does make a queer difference ,"" said the Professor shakily . "" But as regards the project of Dr . Bull --"" "" Project be damned !"""
chesterton#"roared Syme , beside himself . "" Look at him ! Look at his face , look at his collar , look at his blessed boots ! You don ' t suppose , do you , that that thing ' s an anarchist ?"" "" Syme !"" cried the other in an apprehensive agony ."
chesterton#""" Why , by God ,"" said Syme , "" I ' ll take the risk of that myself ! Dr . Bull , I am a police officer . There ' s my card ,"" and he flung down the blue card upon the table . The Professor still feared that all was lost ; but he was loyal . He pulled out his own official card and put it beside his friend ' s . Then the third man burst out laughing , and for the first time that morning they heard his voice ."
chesterton#""" I ' m awfully glad you chaps have come so early ,"" he said , with a sort of schoolboy flippancy , "" for we can all start for France together . Yes , I ' m in the force right enough ,"" and he flicked a blue card towards them lightly as a matter of form . Clapping a brisk bowler on his head and resuming his goblin glasses , the Doctor moved so quickly towards the door , that the others instinctively followed him . Syme seemed a little distrait , and as he passed under the doorway he suddenly struck his stick on the stone passage so that it rang . "" But Lord God Almighty ,"" he cried out , "" if this is all right , there were more damned detectives than there were damned dynamiters at the damned Council !"" "" We might have fought easily ,"" said Bull ; "" we were four against three ."""
chesterton#"The Professor was descending the stairs , but his voice came up from below . "" No ,"" said the voice , "" we were not four against three -- we were not so lucky . We were four against One ."" The others went down the stairs in silence . The young man called Bull , with an innocent courtesy characteristic of him , insisted on going last until they reached the street ; but there his own robust rapidity asserted itself unconsciously , and he walked quickly on ahead towards a railway inquiry office , talking to the others over his shoulder . "" It is jolly to get some pals ,"" he said ."
chesterton#""" I ' ve been half dead with the jumps , being quite alone . I nearly flung my arms round Gogol and embraced him , which would have been imprudent . I hope you won ' t despise me for having been in a blue funk ."" "" All the blue devils in blue hell ,"" said Syme , "" contributed to my blue funk ! But the worst devil was you and your infernal goggles ."" The young man laughed delightedly ."
chesterton#""" Wasn ' t it a rag ?"" he said . "" Such a simple idea -- not my own . I haven ' t got the brains . You see , I wanted to go into the detective service , especially the anti - dynamite business . But for that purpose they wanted someone to dress up as a dynamiter ; and they all swore by blazes that I could never look like a dynamiter ."
chesterton#They said my very walk was respectable , and that seen from behind I looked like the British Constitution . They said I looked too healthy and too optimistic , and too reliable and benevolent ; they called me all sorts of names at Scotland Yard . They said that if I had been a criminal , I might have made my fortune by looking so like an honest man ; but as I had the misfortune to be an honest man , there was not even the remotest chance of my assisting them by ever looking like a criminal . But as last I was brought before some old josser who was high up in the force , and who seemed to have no end of a head on his shoulders . And there the others all talked hopelessly . One asked whether a bushy beard would hide my nice smile ; another said that if they blacked my face I might look like a negro anarchist ; but this old chap chipped in with a most extraordinary remark .
chesterton#' A pair of smoked spectacles will do it ,' he said positively . ' Look at him now ; he looks like an angelic office boy . Put him on a pair of smoked spectacles , and children will scream at the sight of him .' And so it was , by George ! When once my eyes were covered , all the rest , smile and big shoulders and short hair , made me look a perfect little devil . As I say , it was simple enough when it was done , like miracles ; but that wasn ' t the really miraculous part of it .
chesterton#"There was one really staggering thing about the business , and my head still turns at it ."" "" What was that ?"" asked Syme . "" I ' ll tell you ,"" answered the man in spectacles . "" This big pot in the police who sized me up so that he knew how the goggles would go with my hair and socks -- by God , he never saw me at all !"" Syme ' s eyes suddenly flashed on him ."
chesterton#""" How was that ?"" he asked . "" I thought you talked to him ."" "" So I did ,"" said Bull brightly ; "" but we talked in a pitch - dark room like a coalcellar . There , you would never have guessed that ."" "" I could not have conceived it ,"" said Syme gravely ."
chesterton#""" It is indeed a new idea ,"" said the Professor . Their new ally was in practical matters a whirlwind . At the inquiry office he asked with businesslike brevity about the trains for Dover . Having got his information , he bundled the company into a cab , and put them and himself inside a railway carriage before they had properly realised the breathless process . They were already on the Calais boat before conversation flowed freely . "" I had already arranged ,"" he explained , "" to go to France for my lunch ; but I am delighted to have someone to lunch with me ."
chesterton#"You see , I had to send that beast , the Marquis , over with his bomb , because the President had his eye on me , though God knows how . I ' ll tell you the story some day . It was perfectly choking . Whenever I tried to slip out of it I saw the President somewhere , smiling out of the bow - window of a club , or taking off his hat to me from the top of an omnibus . I tell you , you can say what you like , that fellow sold himself to the devil ; he can be in six places at once ."" "" So you sent the Marquis off , I understand ,"" asked the Professor ."
chesterton#""" Was it long ago ? Shall we be in time to catch him ?"" "" Yes ,"" answered the new guide , "" I ' ve timed it all . He ' ll still be at Calais when we arrive ."" "" But when we do catch him at Calais ,"" said the Professor , "" what are we going to do ?"" At this question the countenance of Dr . Bull fell for the first time ."
chesterton#"He reflected a little , and then said -- "" Theoretically , I suppose , we ought to call the police ."" "" Not I ,"" said Syme . "" Theoretically I ought to drown myself first . I promised a poor fellow , who was a real modern pessimist , on my word of honour not to tell the police . I ' m no hand at casuistry , but I can ' t break my word to a modern pessimist ."
chesterton#"It ' s like breaking one ' s word to a child ."" "" I ' m in the same boat ,"" said the Professor . "" I tried to tell the police and I couldn ' t , because of some silly oath I took . You see , when I was an actor I was a sort of all - round beast . Perjury or treason is the only crime I haven ' t committed . If I did that I shouldn ' t know the difference between right and wrong ."""
chesterton#""" I ' ve been through all that ,"" said Dr . Bull , "" and I ' ve made up my mind . I gave my promise to the Secretary -- you know him , man who smiles upside down . My friends , that man is the most utterly unhappy man that was ever human . It may be his digestion , or his conscience , or his nerves , or his philosophy of the universe , but he ' s damned , he ' s in hell ! Well , I can ' t turn on a man like that , and hunt him down . It ' s like whipping a leper ."
chesterton#"I may be mad , but that ' s how I feel ; and there ' s jolly well the end of it ."" "" I don ' t think you ' re mad ,"" said Syme . "" I knew you would decide like that when first you --"" "" Eh ?"" said Dr . Bull . "" When first you took off your spectacles ."""
chesterton#"Dr . Bull smiled a little , and strolled across the deck to look at the sunlit sea . Then he strolled back again , kicking his heels carelessly , and a companionable silence fell between the three men . "" Well ,"" said Syme , "" it seems that we have all the same kind of morality or immorality , so we had better face the fact that comes of it ."" "" Yes ,"" assented the Professor , "" you ' re quite right ; and we must hurry up , for I can see the Grey Nose standing out from France ."" "" The fact that comes of it ,"" said Syme seriously , "" is this , that we three are alone on this planet . Gogol has gone , God knows where ; perhaps the President has smashed him like a fly ."
chesterton#"On the Council we are three men against three , like the Romans who held the bridge . But we are worse off than that , first because they can appeal to their organization and we cannot appeal to ours , and second because --"" "" Because one of those other three men ,"" said the Professor , "" is not a man ."" Syme nodded and was silent for a second or two , then he said -- "" My idea is this . We must do something to keep the Marquis in Calais till tomorrow midday ."
chesterton#I have turned over twenty schemes in my head . We cannot denounce him as a dynamiter ; that is agreed . We cannot get him detained on some trivial charge , for we should have to appear ; he knows us , and he would smell a rat . We cannot pretend to keep him on anarchist business ; he might swallow much in that way , but not the notion of stopping in Calais while the Czar went safely through Paris . We might try to kidnap him , and lock him up ourselves ; but he is a well - known man here . He has a whole bodyguard of friends ; he is very strong and brave , and the event is doubtful .
chesterton#"The only thing I can see to do is actually to take advantage of the very things that are in the Marquis ' s favour . I am going to profit by the fact that he is a highly respected nobleman . I am going to profit by the fact that he has many friends and moves in the best society ."" "" What the devil are you talking about ?"" asked the Professor . "" The Symes are first mentioned in the fourteenth century ,"" said Syme ; "" but there is a tradition that one of them rode behind Bruce at Bannockburn ."
chesterton#"Since 1350 the tree is quite clear ."" "" He ' s gone off his head ,"" said the little Doctor , staring . "" Our bearings ,"" continued Syme calmly , "" are ' argent a chevron gules charged with three cross crosslets of the field .' The motto varies ."" The Professor seized Syme roughly by the waistcoat . "" We are just inshore ,"" he said ."
chesterton#""" Are you seasick or joking in the wrong place ?"" "" My remarks are almost painfully practical ,"" answered Syme , in an unhurried manner . "" The house of St . Eustache also is very ancient . The Marquis cannot deny that he is a gentleman . He cannot deny that I am a gentleman . And in order to put the matter of my social position quite beyond a doubt , I propose at the earliest opportunity to knock his hat off ."
chesterton#"But here we are in the harbour ."" They went on shore under the strong sun in a sort of daze . Syme , who had now taken the lead as Bull had taken it in London , led them along a kind of marine parade until he came to some cafes , embowered in a bulk of greenery and overlooking the sea . As he went before them his step was slightly swaggering , and he swung his stick like a sword . He was making apparently for the extreme end of the line of cafes , but he stopped abruptly . With a sharp gesture he motioned them to silence , but he pointed with one gloved finger to a cafe table under a bank of flowering foliage at which sat the Marquis de St . Eustache , his teeth shining in his thick , black beard , and his bold , brown face shadowed by a light yellow straw hat and outlined against the violet sea ."
chesterton#CHAPTER X THE DUEL SYME sat down at a cafe table with his companions , his blue eyes sparkling like the bright sea below , and ordered a bottle of Saumur with a pleased impatience . He was for some reason in a condition of curious hilarity . His spirits were already unnaturally high ; they rose as the Saumur sank , and in half an hour his talk was a torrent of nonsense . He professed to be making out a plan of the conversation which was going to ensue between himself and the deadly Marquis .
chesterton#"He jotted it down wildly with a pencil . It was arranged like a printed catechism , with questions and answers , and was delivered with an extraordinary rapidity of utterance . "" I shall approach . Before taking off his hat , I shall take off my own . I shall say , ' The Marquis de Saint Eustache , I believe .' He will say , ' The celebrated Mr . Syme , I presume .'"
chesterton#"He will say in the most exquisite French , ' How are you ?' I shall reply in the most exquisite Cockney , ' Oh , just the Syme --' "" "" Oh , shut it ,"" said the man in spectacles . "" Pull yourself together , and chuck away that bit of paper . What are you really going to do ?"" "" But it was a lovely catechism ,"" said Syme pathetically ."
chesterton#""" Do let me read it you . It has only forty - three questions and answers , and some of the Marquis ' s answers are wonderfully witty . I like to be just to my enemy ."" "" But what ' s the good of it all ?"" asked Dr . Bull in exasperation . "" It leads up to my challenge , don ' t you see ,"" said Syme , beaming ."
chesterton#""" When the Marquis has given the thirty - ninth reply , which runs --"" "" Has it by any chance occurred to you ,"" asked the Professor , with a ponderous simplicity , "" that the Marquis may not say all the forty - three things you have put down for him ? In that case , I understand , your own epigrams may appear somewhat more forced ."" Syme struck the table with a radiant face . "" Why , how true that is ,"" he said , "" and I never thought of it . Sir , you have an intellect beyond the common ."
chesterton#"You will make a name ."" "" Oh , you ' re as drunk as an owl !"" said the Doctor . "" It only remains ,"" continued Syme quite unperturbed , "" to adopt some other method of breaking the ice ( if I may so express it ) between myself and the man I wish to kill . And since the course of a dialogue cannot be predicted by one of its parties alone ( as you have pointed out with such recondite acumen ), the only thing to be done , I suppose , is for the one party , as far as possible , to do all the dialogue by himself . And so I will , by George !"""
chesterton#And he stood up suddenly , his yellow hair blowing in the slight sea breeze . A band was playing in a cafe chantant hidden somewhere among the trees , and a woman had just stopped singing . On Syme ' s heated head the bray of the brass band seemed like the jar and jingle of that barrel - organ in Leicester Square , to the tune of which he had once stood up to die . He looked across to the little table where the Marquis sat . The man had two companions now , solemn Frenchmen in frock - coats and silk hats , one of them with the red rosette of the Legion of Honour , evidently people of a solid social position . Besides these black , cylindrical costumes , the Marquis , in his loose straw hat and light spring clothes , looked Bohemian and even barbaric ; but he looked the Marquis .
chesterton#"Indeed , one might say that he looked the king , with his animal elegance , his scornful eyes , and his proud head lifted against the purple sea . But he was no Christian king , at any rate ; he was , rather , some swarthy despot , half Greek , half Asiatic , who in the days when slavery seemed natural looked down on the Mediterranean , on his galley and his groaning slaves . Just so , Syme thought , would the brown - gold face of such a tyrant have shown against the dark green olives and the burning blue . "" Are you going to address the meeting ?"" asked the Professor peevishly , seeing that Syme still stood up without moving . Syme drained his last glass of sparkling wine ."
chesterton#""" I am ,"" he said , pointing across to the Marquis and his companions , "" that meeting . That meeting displeases me . I am going to pull that meeting ' s great ugly , mahogany - coloured nose ."" He stepped across swiftly , if not quite steadily . The Marquis , seeing him , arched his black Assyrian eyebrows in surprise , but smiled politely . "" You are Mr . Syme , I think ,"" he said ."
chesterton#"Syme bowed . "" And you are the Marquis de Saint Eustache ,"" he said gracefully . "" Permit me to pull your nose ."" He leant over to do so , but the Marquis started backwards , upsetting his chair , and the two men in top hats held Syme back by the shoulders . "" This man has insulted me !"" said Syme , with gestures of explanation ."
chesterton#""" Insulted you ?"" cried the gentleman with the red rosette , "" when ?"" "" Oh , just now ,"" said Syme recklessly . "" He insulted my mother ."" "" Insulted your mother !"" exclaimed the gentleman incredulously ."
chesterton#""" Well , anyhow ,"" said Syme , conceding a point , "" my aunt ."" "" But how can the Marquis have insulted your aunt just now ?"" said the second gentleman with some legitimate wonder . "" He has been sitting here all the time ."" "" Ah , it was what he said !"" said Syme darkly ."
chesterton#""" I said nothing at all ,"" said the Marquis , "" except something about the band . I only said that I liked Wagner played well ."" "" It was an allusion to my family ,"" said Syme firmly . "" My aunt played Wagner badly . It was a painful subject . We are always being insulted about it ."""
chesterton#""" This seems most extraordinary ,"" said the gentleman who was decore , looking doubtfully at the Marquis . "" Oh , I assure you ,"" said Syme earnestly , "" the whole of your conversation was simply packed with sinister allusions to my aunt ' s weaknesses ."" "" This is nonsense !"" said the second gentleman . "" I for one have said nothing for half an hour except that I liked the singing of that girl with black hair ."" "" Well , there you are again !"""
chesterton#"said Syme indignantly . "" My aunt ' s was red ."" "" It seems to me ,"" said the other , "" that you are simply seeking a pretext to insult the Marquis ."" "" By George !"" said Syme , facing round and looking at him , "" what a clever chap you are !"" The Marquis started up with eyes flaming like a tiger ' s ."
chesterton#""" Seeking a quarrel with me !"" he cried . "" Seeking a fight with me ! By God ! there was never a man who had to seek long . These gentlemen will perhaps act for me ."
chesterton#"There are still four hours of daylight . Let us fight this evening ."" Syme bowed with a quite beautiful graciousness . "" Marquis ,"" he said , "" your action is worthy of your fame and blood . Permit me to consult for a moment with the gentlemen in whose hands I shall place myself ."" In three long strides he rejoined his companions , and they , who had seen his champagne - inspired attack and listened to his idiotic explanations , were quite startled at the look of him ."
chesterton#"For now that he came back to them he was quite sober , a little pale , and he spoke in a low voice of passionate practicality . "" I have done it ,"" he said hoarsely . "" I have fixed a fight on the beast . But look here , and listen carefully . There is no time for talk . You are my seconds , and everything must come from you ."
chesterton#Now you must insist , and insist absolutely , on the duel coming off after seven tomorrow , so as to give me the chance of preventing him from catching the 7 . 45 for Paris . If he misses that he misses his crime . He can ' t refuse to meet you on such a small point of time and place . But this is what he will do . He will choose a field somewhere near a wayside station , where he can pick up the train . He is a very good swordsman , and he will trust to killing me in time to catch it .
chesterton#"But I can fence well too , and I think I can keep him in play , at any rate , until the train is lost . Then perhaps he may kill me to console his feelings . You understand ? Very well then , let me introduce you to some charming friends of mine ,"" and leading them quickly across the parade , he presented them to the Marquis ' s seconds by two very aristocratic names of which they had not previously heard . Syme was subject to spasms of singular common sense , not otherwise a part of his character . They were ( as he said of his impulse about the spectacles ) poetic intuitions , and they sometimes rose to the exaltation of prophecy ."
chesterton#He had correctly calculated in this case the policy of his opponent . When the Marquis was informed by his seconds that Syme could only fight in the morning , he must fully have realised that an obstacle had suddenly arisen between him and his bomb - throwing business in the capital . Naturally he could not explain this objection to his friends , so he chose the course which Syme had predicted . He induced his seconds to settle on a small meadow not far from the railway , and he trusted to the fatality of the first engagement . When he came down very coolly to the field of honour , no one could have guessed that he had any anxiety about a journey ; his hands were in his pockets , his straw hat on the back of his head , his handsome face brazen in the sun . But it might have struck a stranger as odd that there appeared in his train , not only his seconds carrying the sword - case , but two of his servants carrying a portmanteau and a luncheon basket .
chesterton#Early as was the hour , the sun soaked everything in warmth , and Syme was vaguely surprised to see so many spring flowers burning gold and silver in the tall grass in which the whole company stood almost knee - deep . With the exception of the Marquis , all the men were in sombre and solemn morning - dress , with hats like black chimney - pots ; the little Doctor especially , with the addition of his black spectacles , looked like an undertaker in a farce . Syme could not help feeling a comic contrast between this funereal church parade of apparel and the rich and glistening meadow , growing wild flowers everywhere . But , indeed , this comic contrast between the yellow blossoms and the black hats was but a symbol of the tragic contrast between the yellow blossoms and the black business . On his right was a little wood ; far away to his left lay the long curve of the railway line , which he was , so to speak , guarding from the Marquis , whose goal and escape it was . In front of him , behind the black group of his opponents , he could see , like a tinted cloud , a small almond bush in flower against the faint line of the sea .
chesterton#"The member of the Legion of Honour , whose name it seemed was Colonel Ducroix , approached the Professor and Dr . Bull with great politeness , and suggested that the play should terminate with the first considerable hurt . Dr . Bull , however , having been carefully coached by Syme upon this point of policy , insisted , with great dignity and in very bad French , that it should continue until one of the combatants was disabled . Syme had made up his mind that he could avoid disabling the Marquis and prevent the Marquis from disabling him for at least twenty minutes . In twenty minutes the Paris train would have gone by . "" To a man of the well - known skill and valour of Monsieur de St . Eustache ,"" said the Professor solemnly , "" it must be a matter of indifference which method is adopted , and our principal has strong reasons for demanding the longer encounter , reasons the delicacy of which prevent me from being explicit , but for the just and honourable nature of which I can --"" "" Peste !"""
chesterton#"broke from the Marquis behind , whose face had suddenly darkened , "" let us stop talking and begin ,"" and he slashed off the head of a tall flower with his stick . Syme understood his rude impatience and instinctively looked over his shoulder to see whether the train was coming in sight . But there was no smoke on the horizon . Colonel Ducroix knelt down and unlocked the case , taking out a pair of twin swords , which took the sunlight and turned to two streaks of white fire . He offered one to the Marquis , who snatched it without ceremony , and another to Syme , who took it , bent it , and poised it with as much delay as was consistent with dignity . Then the Colonel took out another pair of blades , and taking one himself and giving another to Dr . Bull , proceeded to place the men ."
chesterton#"Both combatants had thrown off their coats and waistcoats , and stood sword in hand . The seconds stood on each side of the line of fight with drawn swords also , but still sombre in their dark frock - coats and hats . The principals saluted . The Colonel said quietly , "" Engage !"" and the two blades touched and tingled . When the jar of the joined iron ran up Syme ' s arm , all the fantastic fears that have been the subject of this story fell from him like dreams from a man waking up in bed ."
chesterton#He remembered them clearly and in order as mere delusions of the nerves -- how the fear of the Professor had been the fear of the tyrannic accidents of nightmare , and how the fear of the Doctor had been the fear of the airless vacuum of science . The first was the old fear that any miracle might happen , the second the more hopeless modern fear that no miracle can ever happen . But he saw that these fears were fancies , for he found himself in the presence of the great fact of the fear of death , with its coarse and pitiless common sense . He felt like a man who had dreamed all night of falling over precipices , and had woke up on the morning when he was to be hanged . For as soon as he had seen the sunlight run down the channel of his foe ' s foreshortened blade , and as soon as he had felt the two tongues of steel touch , vibrating like two living things , he knew that his enemy was a terrible fighter , and that probably his last hour had come . He felt a strange and vivid value in all the earth around him , in the grass under his feet ; he felt the love of life in all living things .
chesterton#He could almost fancy that he heard the grass growing ; he could almost fancy that even as he stood fresh flowers were springing up and breaking into blossom in the meadow -- flowers blood red and burning gold and blue , fulfilling the whole pageant of the spring . And whenever his eyes strayed for a flash from the calm , staring , hypnotic eyes of the Marquis , they saw the little tuft of almond tree against the sky - line . He had the feeling that if by some miracle he escaped he would be ready to sit for ever before that almond tree , desiring nothing else in the world . But while earth and sky and everything had the living beauty of a thing lost , the other half of his head was as clear as glass , and he was parrying his enemy ' s point with a kind of clockwork skill of which he had hardly supposed himself capable . Once his enemy ' s point ran along his wrist , leaving a slight streak of blood , but it either was not noticed or was tacitly ignored . Every now and then he riposted , and once or twice he could almost fancy that he felt his point go home , but as there was no blood on blade or shirt he supposed he was mistaken .
chesterton#Then came an interruption and a change . At the risk of losing all , the Marquis , interrupting his quiet stare , flashed one glance over his shoulder at the line of railway on his right . Then he turned on Syme a face transfigured to that of a fiend , and began to fight as if with twenty weapons . The attack came so fast and furious , that the one shining sword seemed a shower of shining arrows . Syme had no chance to look at the railway ; but also he had no need . He could guess the reason of the Marquis ' s sudden madness of battle -- the Paris train was in sight .
chesterton#But the Marquis ' s morbid energy over - reached itself . Twice Syme , parrying , knocked his opponent ' s point far out of the fighting circle ; and the third time his riposte was so rapid , that there was no doubt about the hit this time . Syme ' s sword actually bent under the weight of the Marquis ' s body , which it had pierced . Syme was as certain that he had stuck his blade into his enemy as a gardener that he has stuck his spade into the ground . Yet the Marquis sprang back from the stroke without a stagger , and Syme stood staring at his own sword - point like an idiot . There was no blood on it at all .
chesterton#There was an instant of rigid silence , and then Syme in his turn fell furiously on the other , filled with a flaming curiosity . The Marquis was probably , in a general sense , a better fencer than he , as he had surmised at the beginning , but at the moment the Marquis seemed distraught and at a disadvantage . He fought wildly and even weakly , and he constantly looked away at the railway line , almost as if he feared the train more than the pointed steel . Syme , on the other hand , fought fiercely but still carefully , in an intellectual fury , eager to solve the riddle of his own bloodless sword . For this purpose , he aimed less at the Marquis ' s body , and more at his throat and head . A minute and a half afterwards he felt his point enter the man ' s neck below the jaw .
chesterton#It came out clean . Half mad , he thrust again , and made what should have been a bloody scar on the Marquis ' s cheek . But there was no scar . For one moment the heaven of Syme again grew black with supernatural terrors . Surely the man had a charmed life . But this new spiritual dread was a more awful thing than had been the mere spiritual topsy - turvydom symbolised by the paralytic who pursued him .
chesterton#"The Professor was only a goblin ; this man was a devil -- perhaps he was the Devil ! Anyhow , this was certain , that three times had a human sword been driven into him and made no mark . When Syme had that thought he drew himself up , and all that was good in him sang high up in the air as a high wind sings in the trees . He thought of all the human things in his story -- of the Chinese lanterns in Saffron Park , of the girl ' s red hair in the garden , of the honest , beer - swilling sailors down by the dock , of his loyal companions standing by . Perhaps he had been chosen as a champion of all these fresh and kindly things to cross swords with the enemy of all creation . "" After all ,"" he said to himself , "" I am more than a devil ; I am a man ."
chesterton#"I can do the one thing which Satan himself cannot do -- I can die ,"" and as the word went through his head , he heard a faint and far - off hoot , which would soon be the roar of the Paris train . He fell to fighting again with a supernatural levity , like a Mohammedan panting for Paradise . As the train came nearer and nearer he fancied he could see people putting up the floral arches in Paris ; he joined in the growing noise and the glory of the great Republic whose gate he was guarding against Hell . His thoughts rose higher and higher with the rising roar of the train , which ended , as if proudly , in a long and piercing whistle . The train stopped . Suddenly , to the astonishment of everyone the Marquis sprang back quite out of sword reach and threw down his sword ."
chesterton#"The leap was wonderful , and not the less wonderful because Syme had plunged his sword a moment before into the man ' s thigh . "" Stop !"" said the Marquis in a voice that compelled a momentary obedience . "" I want to say something ."" "" What is the matter ?"" asked Colonel Ducroix , staring ."
chesterton#""" Has there been foul play ?"" "" There has been foul play somewhere ,"" said Dr . Bull , who was a little pale . "" Our principal has wounded the Marquis four times at least , and he is none the worse ."" The Marquis put up his hand with a curious air of ghastly patience . "" Please let me speak ,"" he said . "" It is rather important ."
chesterton#"Mr . Syme ,"" he continued , turning to his opponent , "" we are fighting today , if I remember right , because you expressed a wish ( which I thought irrational ) to pull my nose . Would you oblige me by pulling my nose now as quickly as possible ? I have to catch a train ."" "" I protest that this is most irregular ,"" said Dr . Bull indignantly . "" It is certainly somewhat opposed to precedent ,"" said Colonel Ducroix , looking wistfully at his principal . "" There is , I think , one case on record ( Captain Bellegarde and the Baron Zumpt ) in which the weapons were changed in the middle of the encounter at the request of one of the combatants ."
chesterton#"But one can hardly call one ' s nose a weapon ."" "" Will you or will you not pull my nose ?"" said the Marquis in exasperation . "" Come , come , Mr . Syme ! You wanted to do it , do it ! You can have no conception of how important it is to me ."
chesterton#"Don ' t be so selfish ! Pull my nose at once , when I ask you !"" and he bent slightly forward with a fascinating smile . The Paris train , panting and groaning , had grated into a little station behind the neighbouring hill . Syme had the feeling he had more than once had in these adventures -- the sense that a horrible and sublime wave lifted to heaven was just toppling over . Walking in a world he half understood , he took two paces forward and seized the Roman nose of this remarkable nobleman ."
chesterton#"He pulled it hard , and it came off in his hand . He stood for some seconds with a foolish solemnity , with the pasteboard proboscis still between his fingers , looking at it , while the sun and the clouds and the wooded hills looked down upon this imbecile scene . The Marquis broke the silence in a loud and cheerful voice . "" If anyone has any use for my left eyebrow ,"" he said , "" he can have it . Colonel Ducroix , do accept my left eyebrow ! It ' s the kind of thing that might come in useful any day ,"" and he gravely tore off one of his swarthy Assyrian brows , bringing about half his brown forehead with it , and politely offered it to the Colonel , who stood crimson and speechless with rage ."
chesterton#""" If I had known ,"" he spluttered , "" that I was acting for a poltroon who pads himself to fight --"" "" Oh , I know , I know !"" said the Marquis , recklessly throwing various parts of himself right and left about the field . "" You are making a mistake ; but it can ' t be explained just now . I tell you the train has come into the station !"" "" Yes ,"" said Dr . Bull fiercely , "" and the train shall go out of the station ."
chesterton#"It shall go out without you . We know well enough for what devil ' s work --"" The mysterious Marquis lifted his hands with a desperate gesture . He was a strange scarecrow standing there in the sun with half his old face peeled off , and half another face glaring and grinning from underneath . "" Will you drive me mad ?"" he cried ."
chesterton#""" The train --"" "" You shall not go by the train ,"" said Syme firmly , and grasped his sword . The wild figure turned towards Syme , and seemed to be gathering itself for a sublime effort before speaking . "" You great fat , blasted , blear - eyed , blundering , thundering , brainless , Godforsaken , doddering , damned fool !"" he said without taking breath . "" You great silly , pink - faced , towheaded turnip !"
chesterton#"You --"" "" You shall not go by this train ,"" repeated Syme . "" And why the infernal blazes ,"" roared the other , "" should I want to go by the train ?"" "" We know all ,"" said the Professor sternly . "" You are going to Paris to throw a bomb !"" "" Going to Jericho to throw a Jabberwock !"""
chesterton#"cried the other , tearing his hair , which came off easily . "" Have you all got softening of the brain , that you don ' t realise what I am ? Did you really think I wanted to catch that train ? Twenty Paris trains might go by for me . Damn Paris trains !"" "" Then what did you care about ?"""
chesterton#"began the Professor . "" What did I care about ? I didn ' t care about catching the train ; I cared about whether the train caught me , and now , by God ! it has caught me ."" "" I regret to inform you ,"" said Syme with restraint , "" that your remarks convey no impression to my mind . Perhaps if you were to remove the remains of your original forehead and some portion of what was once your chin , your meaning would become clearer ."
chesterton#"Mental lucidity fulfils itself in many ways . What do you mean by saying that the train has caught you ? It may be my literary fancy , but somehow I feel that it ought to mean something ."" "" It means everything ,"" said the other , "" and the end of everything . Sunday has us now in the hollow of his hand ."" "" Us !"""
chesterton#"repeated the Professor , as if stupefied . "" What do you mean by ' us '?"" "" The police , of course !"" said the Marquis , and tore off his scalp and half his face . The head which emerged was the blonde , well brushed , smooth - haired head which is common in the English constabulary , but the face was terribly pale . "" I am Inspector Ratcliffe ,"" he said , with a sort of haste that verged on harshness ."
chesterton#""" My name is pretty well known to the police , and I can see well enough that you belong to them . But if there is any doubt about my position , I have a card "" and he began to pull a blue card from his pocket . The Professor gave a tired gesture . "" Oh , don ' t show it us ,"" he said wearily ; "" we ' ve got enough of them to equip a paper - chase ."" The little man named Bull , had , like many men who seem to be of a mere vivacious vulgarity , sudden movements of good taste . Here he certainly saved the situation ."
chesterton#"In the midst of this staggering transformation scene he stepped forward with all the gravity and responsibility of a second , and addressed the two seconds of the Marquis . "" Gentlemen ,"" he said , "" we all owe you a serious apology ; but I assure you that you have not been made the victims of such a low joke as you imagine , or indeed of anything undignified in a man of honour . You have not wasted your time ; you have helped to save the world . We are not buffoons , but very desperate men at war with a vast conspiracy . A secret society of anarchists is hunting us like hares ; not such unfortunate madmen as may here or there throw a bomb through starvation or German philosophy , but a rich and powerful and fanatical church , a church of eastern pessimism , which holds it holy to destroy mankind like vermin . How hard they hunt us you can gather from the fact that we are driven to such disguises as those for which I apologise , and to such pranks as this one by which you suffer . """
chesterton#"The younger second of the Marquis , a short man with a black moustache , bowed politely , and said -- "" Of course , I accept the apology ; but you will in your turn forgive me if I decline to follow you further into your difficulties , and permit myself to say good morning ! The sight of an acquaintance and distinguished fellow - townsman coming to pieces in the open air is unusual , and , upon the whole , sufficient for one day . Colonel Ducroix , I would in no way influence your actions , but if you feel with me that our present society is a little abnormal , I am now going to walk back to the town ."" Colonel Ducroix moved mechanically , but then tugged abruptly at his white moustache and broke out -- "" No , by George !"
chesterton#"I won ' t . If these gentlemen are really in a mess with a lot of low wreckers like that , I ' ll see them through it . I have fought for France , and it is hard if I can ' t fight for civilization ."" Dr . Bull took off his hat and waved it , cheering as at a public meeting . "" Don ' t make too much noise ,"" said Inspector Ratcliffe , "" Sunday may hear you ."" "" Sunday !"""
chesterton#"cried Bull , and dropped his hat . "" Yes ,"" retorted Ratcliffe , "" he may be with them ."" "" With whom ?"" asked Syme . "" With the people out of that train ,"" said the other . "" What you say seems utterly wild ,"" began Syme ."
chesterton#""" Why , as a matter of fact -- But , my God ,"" he cried out suddenly , like a man who sees an explosion a long way off , "" by God ! if this is true the whole bally lot of us on the Anarchist Council were against anarchy ! Every born man was a detective except the President and his personal secretary . What can it mean ?"" "" Mean !"" said the new policeman with incredible violence ."
chesterton#""" It means that we are struck dead ! Don ' t you know Sunday ? Don ' t you know that his jokes are always so big and simple that one has never thought of them ? Can you think of anything more like Sunday than this , that he should put all his powerful enemies on the Supreme Council , and then take care that it was not supreme ? I tell you he has bought every trust , he has captured every cable , he has control of every railway line -- especially of that railway line !"" and he pointed a shaking finger towards the small wayside station ."
chesterton#""" The whole movement was controlled by him ; half the world was ready to rise for him . But there were just five people , perhaps , who would have resisted him . . . and the old devil put them on the Supreme Council , to waste their time in watching each other . Idiots that we are , he planned the whole of our idiocies !"
chesterton#"Sunday knew that the Professor would chase Syme through London , and that Syme would fight me in France . And he was combining great masses of capital , and seizing great lines of telegraphy , while we five idiots were running after each other like a lot of confounded babies playing blind man ' s buff ."" "" Well ?"" asked Syme with a sort of steadiness . "" Well ,"" replied the other with sudden serenity , "" he has found us playing blind man ' s buff today in a field of great rustic beauty and extreme solitude . He has probably captured the world ; it only remains to him to capture this field and all the fools in it ."
chesterton#"And since you really want to know what was my objection to the arrival of that train , I will tell you . My objection was that Sunday or his Secretary has just this moment got out of it ."" Syme uttered an involuntary cry , and they all turned their eyes towards the far - off station . It was quite true that a considerable bulk of people seemed to be moving in their direction . But they were too distant to be distinguished in any way . "" It was a habit of the late Marquis de St . Eustache ,"" said the new policeman , producing a leather case , "" always to carry a pair of opera glasses ."
chesterton#"Either the President or the Secretary is coming after us with that mob . They have caught us in a nice quiet place where we are under no temptations to break our oaths by calling the police . Dr . Bull , I have a suspicion that you will see better through these than through your own highly decorative spectacles ."" He handed the field - glasses to the Doctor , who immediately took off his spectacles and put the apparatus to his eyes . "" It cannot be as bad as you say ,"" said the Professor , somewhat shaken . "" There are a good number of them certainly , but they may easily be ordinary tourists ."""
chesterton#""" Do ordinary tourists ,"" asked Bull , with the fieldglasses to his eyes , "" wear black masks half - way down the face ?"" Syme almost tore the glasses out of his hand , and looked through them . Most men in the advancing mob really looked ordinary enough ; but it was quite true that two or three of the leaders in front wore black half - masks almost down to their mouths . This disguise is very complete , especially at such a distance , and Syme found it impossible to conclude anything from the clean - shaven jaws and chins of the men talking in the front . But presently as they talked they all smiled and one of them smiled on one side . CHAPTER XI"
chesterton#"THE CRIMINALS CHASE THE POLICE SYME put the field - glasses from his eyes with an almost ghastly relief . "" The President is not with them , anyhow ,"" he said , and wiped his forehead . "" But surely they are right away on the horizon ,"" said the bewildered Colonel , blinking and but half recovered from Bull ' s hasty though polite explanation . "" Could you possibly know your President among all those people ?"" "" Could I know a white elephant among all those people !"""
chesterton#"answered Syme somewhat irritably . "" As you very truly say , they are on the horizon ; but if he were walking with them . . . by God ! I believe this ground would shake ."""
chesterton#"After an instant ' s pause the new man called Ratcliffe said with gloomy decision -- "" Of course the President isn ' t with them . I wish to Gemini he were . Much more likely the President is riding in triumph through Paris , or sitting on the ruins of St . Paul ' s Cathedral ."" "" This is absurd !"" said Syme ."
chesterton#""" Something may have happened in our absence ; but he cannot have carried the world with a rush like that . It is quite true ,"" he added , frowning dubiously at the distant fields that lay towards the little station , "" it is certainly true that there seems to be a crowd coming this way ; but they are not all the army that you make out ."" "" Oh , they ,"" said the new detective contemptuously ; "" no they are not a very valuable force . But let me tell you frankly that they are precisely calculated to our value -- we are not much , my boy , in Sunday ' s universe . He has got hold of all the cables and telegraphs himself . But to kill the Supreme Council he regards as a trivial matter , like a post card ; it may be left to his private secretary ,"" and he spat on the grass ."
chesterton#"Then he turned to the others and said somewhat austerely -- "" There is a great deal to be said for death ; but if anyone has any preference for the other alternative , I strongly advise him to walk after me ."" With these words , he turned his broad back and strode with silent energy towards the wood . The others gave one glance over their shoulders , and saw that the dark cloud of men had detached itself from the station and was moving with a mysterious discipline across the plain . They saw already , even with the naked eye , black blots on the foremost faces , which marked the masks they wore . They turned and followed their leader , who had already struck the wood , and disappeared among the twinkling trees ."
chesterton#The sun on the grass was dry and hot . So in plunging into the wood they had a cool shock of shadow , as of divers who plunge into a dim pool . The inside of the wood was full of shattered sunlight and shaken shadows . They made a sort of shuddering veil , almost recalling the dizziness of a cinematograph . Even the solid figures walking with him Syme could hardly see for the patterns of sun and shade that danced upon them . Now a man ' s head was lit as with a light of Rembrandt , leaving all else obliterated ; now again he had strong and staring white hands with the face of a negro .
chesterton#The ex - Marquis had pulled the old straw hat over his eyes , and the black shade of the brim cut his face so squarely in two that it seemed to be wearing one of the black half - masks of their pursuers . The fancy tinted Syme ' s overwhelming sense of wonder . Was he wearing a mask ? Was anyone wearing a mask ? Was anyone anything ? This wood of witchery , in which men ' s faces turned black and white by turns , in which their figures first swelled into sunlight and then faded into formless night , this mere chaos of chiaroscuro ( after the clear daylight outside ), seemed to Syme a perfect symbol of the world in which he had been moving for three days , this world where men took off their beards and their spectacles and their noses , and turned into other people .
chesterton#That tragic self - confidence which he had felt when he believed that the Marquis was a devil had strangely disappeared now that he knew that the Marquis was a friend . He felt almost inclined to ask after all these bewilderments what was a friend and what an enemy . Was there anything that was apart from what it seemed ? The Marquis had taken off his nose and turned out to be a detective . Might he not just as well take off his head and turn out to be a hobgoblin ? Was not everything , after all , like this bewildering woodland , this dance of dark and light ?
chesterton#Everything only a glimpse , the glimpse always unforeseen , and always forgotten . For Gabriel Syme had found in the heart of that sun - splashed wood what many modern painters had found there . He had found the thing which the modern people call Impressionism , which is another name for that final scepticism which can find no floor to the universe . As a man in an evil dream strains himself to scream and wake , Syme strove with a sudden effort to fling off this last and worst of his fancies . With two impatient strides he overtook the man in the Marquis ' s straw hat , the man whom he had come to address as Ratcliffe . In a voice exaggeratively loud and cheerful , he broke the bottomless silence and made conversation .
chesterton#""" May I ask ,"" he said , "" where on earth we are all going to ? "" So genuine had been the doubts of his soul , that he was quite glad to hear his companion speak in an easy , human voice . "" We must get down through the town of Lancy to the sea ,"" he said . "" I think that part of the country is least likely to be with them ."" "" What can you mean by all this ?"" cried Syme ."
chesterton#""" They can ' t be running the real world in that way . Surely not many working men are anarchists , and surely if they were , mere mobs could not beat modern armies and police ."" "" Mere mobs !"" repeated his new friend with a snort of scorn . "" So you talk about mobs and the working classes as if they were the question . You ' ve got that eternal idiotic idea that if anarchy came it would come from the poor ."
chesterton#"Why should it ? The poor have been rebels , but they have never been anarchists ; they have more interest than anyone else in there being some decent government . The poor man really has a stake in the country . The rich man hasn ' t ; he can go away to New Guinea in a yacht . The poor have sometimes objected to being governed badly ; the rich have always objected to being governed at all . Aristocrats were always anarchists , as you can see from the barons ' wars ."""
chesterton#""" As a lecture on English history for the little ones ,"" said Syme , "" this is all very nice ; but I have not yet grasped its application ."" "" Its application is ,"" said his informant , "" that most of old Sunday ' s right - hand men are South African and American millionaires . That is why he has got hold of all the communications ; and that is why the last four champions of the anti - anarchist police force are running through a wood like rabbits ."" "" Millionaires I can understand ,"" said Syme thoughtfully , "" they are nearly all mad . But getting hold of a few wicked old gentlemen with hobbies is one thing ; getting hold of great Christian nations is another . I would bet the nose off my face ( forgive the allusion ) that Sunday would stand perfectly helpless before the task of converting any ordinary healthy person anywhere ."""
chesterton#""" Well ,"" said the other , "" it rather depends what sort of person you mean ."" "" Well , for instance ,"" said Syme , "" he could never convert that person ,"" and he pointed straight in front of him . They had come to an open space of sunlight , which seemed to express to Syme the final return of his own good sense ; and in the middle of this forest clearing was a figure that might well stand for that common sense in an almost awful actuality . Burnt by the sun and stained with perspiration , and grave with the bottomless gravity of small necessary toils , a heavy French peasant was cutting wood with a hatchet . His cart stood a few yards off , already half full of timber ; and the horse that cropped the grass was , like his master , valorous but not desperate ; like his master , he was even prosperous , but yet was almost sad . The man was a Norman , taller than the average of the French and very angular ; and his swarthy figure stood dark against a square of sunlight , almost like some allegoric figure of labour frescoed on a ground of gold ."
chesterton#""" Mr . Syme is saying ,"" called out Ratcliffe to the French Colonel , "" that this man , at least , will never be an anarchist ."" "" Mr . Syme is right enough there ,"" answered Colonel Ducroix , laughing , "" if only for the reason that he has plenty of property to defend . But I forgot that in your country you are not used to peasants being wealthy ."" "" He looks poor ,"" said Dr . Bull doubtfully . "" Quite so ,"" said the Colonel ; "" that is why he is rich ."" "" I have an idea ,"" called out Dr . Bull suddenly ; "" how much would he take to give us a lift in his cart ?"
chesterton#"Those dogs are all on foot , and we could soon leave them behind ."" "" Oh , give him anything !"" said Syme eagerly . "" I have piles of money on me ."" "" That will never do ,"" said the Colonel ; "" he will never have any respect for you unless you drive a bargain ."" "" Oh , if he haggles !"""
chesterton#"began Bull impatiently . "" Erie haggles because he is a free man ,"" said the other . "" You do not understand ; he would not see the meaning of generosity . He is not being tipped ."" And even while they seemed to hear the heavy feet of their strange pursuers behind them , they had to stand and stamp while the French Colonel talked to the French wood - cutter with all the leisurely badinage and bickering of market - day . At the end of the four minutes , however , they saw that the Colonel was right , for the wood - cutter entered into their plans , not with the vague servility of a tout too - well paid , but with the seriousness of a solicitor who had been paid the proper fee ."
chesterton#He told them that the best thing they could do was to make their way down to the little inn on the hills above Lancy , where the innkeeper , an old soldier who had become devot in his latter years , would be certain to sympathise with them , and even to take risks in their support . The whole company , therefore , piled themselves on top of the stacks of wood , and went rocking in the rude cart down the other and steeper side of the woodland . Heavy and ramshackle as was the vehicle , it was driven quickly enough , and they soon had the exhilarating impression of distancing altogether those , whoever they were , who were hunting them . For , after all , the riddle as to where the anarchists had got all these followers was still unsolved . One man ' s presence had sufficed for them ; they had fled at the first sight of the deformed smile of the Secretary . Syme every now and then looked back over his shoulder at the army on their track .
chesterton#As the wood grew first thinner and then smaller with distance , he could see the sunlit slopes beyond it and above it ; and across these was still moving the square black mob like one monstrous beetle . In the very strong sunlight and with his own very strong eyes , which were almost telescopic , Syme could see this mass of men quite plainly . He could see them as separate human figures ; but he was increasingly surprised by the way in which they moved as one man . They seemed to be dressed in dark clothes and plain hats , like any common crowd out of the streets ; but they did not spread and sprawl and trail by various lines to the attack , as would be natural in an ordinary mob . They moved with a sort of dreadful and wicked woodenness , like a staring army of automatons . Syme pointed this out to Ratcliffe .
chesterton#""" Yes ,"" replied the policeman , "" that ' s discipline . That ' s Sunday . He is perhaps five hundred miles off , but the fear of him is on all of them , like the finger of God . Yes , they are walking regularly ; and you bet your boots that they are talking regularly , yes , and thinking regularly . But the one important thing for us is that they are disappearing regularly ."" Syme nodded ."
chesterton#"It was true that the black patch of the pursuing men was growing smaller and smaller as the peasant belaboured his horse . The level of the sunlit landscape , though flat as a whole , fell away on the farther side of the wood in billows of heavy slope towards the sea , in a way not unlike the lower slopes of the Sussex downs . The only difference was that in Sussex the road would have been broken and angular like a little brook , but here the white French road fell sheer in front of them like a waterfall . Down this direct descent the cart clattered at a considerable angle , and in a few minutes , the road growing yet steeper , they saw below them the little harbour of Lancy and a great blue arc of the sea . The travelling cloud of their enemies had wholly disappeared from the horizon . The horse and cart took a sharp turn round a clump of elms , and the horse ' s nose nearly struck the face of an old gentleman who was sitting on the benches outside the little cafe of "" Le Soleil d ' Or ."""
chesterton#The peasant grunted an apology , and got down from his seat . The others also descended one by one , and spoke to the old gentleman with fragmentary phrases of courtesy , for it was quite evident from his expansive manner that he was the owner of the little tavern . He was a white - haired , apple - faced old boy , with sleepy eyes and a grey moustache ; stout , sedentary , and very innocent , of a type that may often be found in France , but is still commoner in Catholic Germany . Everything about him , his pipe , his pot of beer , his flowers , and his beehive , suggested an ancestral peace ; only when his visitors looked up as they entered the inn - parlour , they saw the sword upon the wall . The Colonel , who greeted the innkeeper as an old friend , passed rapidly into the inn - parlour , and sat down ordering some ritual refreshment . The military decision of his action interested Syme , who sat next to him , and he took the opportunity when the old innkeeper had gone out of satisfying his curiosity .
chesterton#""" May I ask you , Colonel ,"" he said in a low voice , "" why we have come here ?"" Colonel Ducroix smiled behind his bristly white moustache . "" For two reasons , sir ,"" he said ; "" and I will give first , not the most important , but the most utilitarian . We came here because this is the only place within twenty miles in which we can get horses ."" "" Horses !"" repeated Syme , looking up quickly ."
chesterton#""" Yes ,"" replied the other ; "" if you people are really to distance your enemies it is horses or nothing for you , unless of course you have bicycles and motor - cars in your pocket ."" "" And where do you advise us to make for ?"" asked Syme doubtfully . "" Beyond question ,"" replied the Colonel , "" you had better make all haste to the police station beyond the town . My friend , whom I seconded under somewhat deceptive circumstances , seems to me to exaggerate very much the possibilities of a general rising ; but even he would hardly maintain , I suppose , that you were not safe with the gendarmes ."" Syme nodded gravely ; then he said abruptly --"
chesterton#""" And your other reason for coming here ?"" "" My other reason for coming here ,"" said Ducroix soberly , "" is that it is just as well to see a good man or two when one is possibly near to death ."" Syme looked up at the wall , and saw a crudely - painted and pathetic religious picture . Then he said -- "" You are right ,"" and then almost immediately afterwards , "" Has anyone seen about the horses ?"" "" Yes ,"" answered Ducroix , "" you may be quite certain that I gave orders the moment I came in ."
chesterton#"Those enemies of yours gave no impression of hurry , but they were really moving wonderfully fast , like a well - trained army . I had no idea that the anarchists had so much discipline . You have not a moment to waste ."" Almost as he spoke , the old innkeeper with the blue eyes and white hair came ambling into the room , and announced that six horses were saddled outside . By Ducroix ' s advice the five others equipped themselves with some portable form of food and wine , and keeping their duelling swords as the only weapons available , they clattered away down the steep , white road . The two servants , who had carried the Marquis ' s luggage when he was a marquis , were left behind to drink at the cafe by common consent , and not at all against their own inclination ."
chesterton#By this time the afternoon sun was slanting westward , and by its rays Syme could see the sturdy figure of the old innkeeper growing smaller and smaller , but still standing and looking after them quite silently , the sunshine in his silver hair . Syme had a fixed , superstitious fancy , left in his mind by the chance phrase of the Colonel , that this was indeed , perhaps , the last honest stranger whom he should ever see upon the earth . He was still looking at this dwindling figure , which stood as a mere grey blot touched with a white flame against the great green wall of the steep down behind him . And as he stared over the top of the down behind the innkeeper , there appeared an army of black - clad and marching men . They seemed to hang above the good man and his house like a black cloud of locusts . The horses had been saddled none too soon .
chesterton#"CHAPTER XII THE EARTH IN ANARCHY URGING the horses to a gallop , without respect to the rather rugged descent of the road , the horsemen soon regained their advantage over the men on the march , and at last the bulk of the first buildings of Lancy cut off the sight of their pursuers . Nevertheless , the ride had been a long one , and by the time they reached the real town the west was warming with the colour and quality of sunset . The Colonel suggested that , before making finally for the police station , they should make the effort , in passing , to attach to themselves one more individual who might be useful . "" Four out of the five rich men in this town ,"" he said , "" are common swindlers ."
chesterton#"I suppose the proportion is pretty equal all over the world . The fifth is a friend of mine , and a very fine fellow ; and what is even more important from our point of view , he owns a motor - car ."" "" I am afraid ,"" said the Professor in his mirthful way , looking back along the white road on which the black , crawling patch might appear at any moment , "" I am afraid we have hardly time for afternoon calls ."" "" Doctor Renard ' s house is only three minutes off ,"" said the Colonel . "" Our danger ,"" said Dr . Bull , "" is not two minutes off ."" "" Yes ,"" said Syme , "" if we ride on fast we must leave them behind , for they are on foot ."""
chesterton#""" He has a motor - car ,"" said the Colonel . "" But we may not get it ,"" said Bull . "" Yes , he is quite on your side ."" "" But he might be out ."" "" Hold your tongue ,"" said Syme suddenly . "" What is that noise ?"""
chesterton#"For a second they all sat as still as equestrian statues , and for a second -- for two or three or four seconds -- heaven and earth seemed equally still . Then all their ears , in an agony of attention , heard along the road that indescribable thrill and throb that means only one thing -- horses ! The Colonel ' s face had an instantaneous change , as if lightning had struck it , and yet left it scatheless . "" They have done us ,"" he said , with brief military irony . "" Prepare to receive cavalry !"" "" Where can they have got the horses ?"""
chesterton#"asked Syme , as he mechanically urged his steed to a canter . The Colonel was silent for a little , then he said in a strained voice -- "" I was speaking with strict accuracy when I said that the ' Soleil d ' Or ' was the only place where one can get horses within twenty miles ."" "" No !"" said Syme violently , "" I don ' t believe he ' d do it . Not with all that white hair ."""
chesterton#""" He may have been forced ,"" said the Colonel gently . "" They must be at least a hundred strong , for which reason we are all going to see my friend Renard , who has a motor - car ."" With these words he swung his horse suddenly round a street corner , and went down the street with such thundering speed , that the others , though already well at the gallop , had difficulty in following the flying tail of his horse . Dr . Renard inhabited a high and comfortable house at the top of a steep street , so that when the riders alighted at his door they could once more see the solid green ridge of the hill , with the white road across it , standing up above all the roofs of the town . They breathed again to see that the road as yet was clear , and they rang the bell . Dr . Renard was a beaming , brown - bearded man , a good example of that silent but very busy professional class which France has preserved even more perfectly than England ."
chesterton#"When the matter was explained to him he pooh - poohed the panic of the ex - Marquis altogether ; he said , with the solid French scepticism , that there was no conceivable probability of a general anarchist rising . "" Anarchy ,"" he said , shrugging his shoulders , "" it is childishness !"" "" Et ca ,"" cried out the Colonel suddenly , pointing over the other ' s shoulder , "" and that is childishness , isn ' t it ?"" They all looked round , and saw a curve of black cavalry come sweeping over the top of the hill with all the energy of Attila . Swiftly as they rode , however , the whole rank still kept well together , and they could see the black vizards of the first line as level as a line of uniforms . But although the main black square was the same , though travelling faster , there was now one sensational difference which they could see clearly upon the slope of the hill , as if upon a slanted map ."
chesterton#"The bulk of the riders were in one block ; but one rider flew far ahead of the column , and with frantic movements of hand and heel urged his horse faster and faster , so that one might have fancied that he was not the pursuer but the pursued . But even at that great distance they could see something so fanatical , so unquestionable in his figure , that they knew it was the Secretary himself . "" I am sorry to cut short a cultured discussion ,"" said the Colonel , "" but can you lend me your motor - car now , in two minutes ?"" "" I have a suspicion that you are all mad ,"" said Dr . Renard , smiling sociably ; "" but God forbid that madness should in any way interrupt friendship . Let us go round to the garage ."" Dr . Renard was a mild man with monstrous wealth ; his rooms were like the Musee de Cluny , and he had three motor - cars ."
chesterton#"These , however , he seemed to use very sparingly , having the simple tastes of the French middle class , and when his impatient friends came to examine them , it took them some time to assure themselves that one of them even could be made to work . This with some difficulty they brought round into the street before the Doctor ' s house . When they came out of the dim garage they were startled to find that twilight had already fallen with the abruptness of night in the tropics . Either they had been longer in the place than they imagined , or some unusual canopy of cloud had gathered over the town . They looked down the steep streets , and seemed to see a slight mist coming up from the sea . "" It is now or never ,"" said Dr . Bull ."
chesterton#""" I hear horses ."" "" No ,"" corrected the Professor , "" a horse ."" And as they listened , it was evident that the noise , rapidly coming nearer on the rattling stones , was not the noise of the whole cavalcade but that of the one horseman , who had left it far behind -- the insane Secretary . Syme ' s family , like most of those who end in the simple life , had once owned a motor , and he knew all about them . He had leapt at once into the chauffeur ' s seat , and with flushed face was wrenching and tugging at the disused machinery . He bent his strength upon one handle , and then said quite quietly --"
chesterton#""" I am afraid it ' s no go ."" As he spoke , there swept round the corner a man rigid on his rushing horse , with the rush and rigidity of an arrow . He had a smile that thrust out his chin as if it were dislocated . He swept alongside of the stationary car , into which its company had crowded , and laid his hand on the front . It was the Secretary , and his mouth went quite straight in the solemnity of triumph . Syme was leaning hard upon the steering wheel , and there was no sound but the rumble of the other pursuers riding into the town ."
chesterton#"Then there came quite suddenly a scream of scraping iron , and the car leapt forward . It plucked the Secretary clean out of his saddle , as a knife is whipped out of its sheath , trailed him kicking terribly for twenty yards , and left him flung flat upon the road far in front of his frightened horse . As the car took the corner of the street with a splendid curve , they could just see the other anarchists filling the street and raising their fallen leader . "" I can ' t understand why it has grown so dark ,"" said the Professor at last in a low voice . "" Going to be a storm , I think ,"" said Dr . Bull . "" I say , it ' s a pity we haven ' t got a light on this car , if only to see by ."""
chesterton#""" We have ,"" said the Colonel , and from the floor of the car he fished up a heavy , old - fashioned , carved iron lantern with a light inside it . It was obviously an antique , and it would seem as if its original use had been in some way semi - religious , for there was a rude moulding of a cross upon one of its sides . "" Where on earth did you get that ?"" asked the Professor . "" I got it where I got the car ,"" answered the Colonel , chuckling , "" from my best friend . While our friend here was fighting with the steering wheel , I ran up the front steps of the house and spoke to Renard , who was standing in his own porch , you will remember ."
chesterton#"' I suppose ,' I said , ' there ' s no time to get a lamp .' He looked up , blinking amiably at the beautiful arched ceiling of his own front hall . From this was suspended , by chains of exquisite ironwork , this lantern , one of the hundred treasures of his treasure house . By sheer force he tore the lamp out of his own ceiling , shattering the painted panels , and bringing down two blue vases with his violence . Then he handed me the iron lantern , and I put it in the car . Was I not right when I said that Dr . Renard was worth knowing ?"""
chesterton#""" You were ,"" said Syme seriously , and hung the heavy lantern over the front . There was a certain allegory of their whole position in the contrast between the modern automobile and its strange ecclesiastical lamp . Hitherto they had passed through the quietest part of the town , meeting at most one or two pedestrians , who could give them no hint of the peace or the hostility of the place . Now , however , the windows in the houses began one by one to be lit up , giving a greater sense of habitation and humanity . Dr . Bull turned to the new detective who had led their flight , and permitted himself one of his natural and friendly smiles . "" These lights make one feel more cheerful ."""
chesterton#"Inspector Ratcliffe drew his brows together . "" There is only one set of lights that make me more cheerful ,"" he said , "" and they are those lights of the police station which I can see beyond the town . Please God we may be there in ten minutes ."" Then all Bull ' s boiling good sense and optimism broke suddenly out of him . "" Oh , this is all raving nonsense !"" he cried ."
chesterton#""" If you really think that ordinary people in ordinary houses are anarchists , you must be madder than an anarchist yourself . If we turned and fought these fellows , the whole town would fight for us ."" "" No ,"" said the other with an immovable simplicity , "" the whole town would fight for them . We shall see .' While they were speaking the Professor had leant forward with sudden excitement . "" What is that noise ?"""
chesterton#"he said . "" Oh , the horses behind us , I suppose ,"" said the Colonel . "" I thought we had got clear of them ."" "" The horses behind us ! No ,"" said the Professor , "" it is not horses , and it is not behind us ."" Almost as he spoke , across the end of the street before them two shining and rattling shapes shot past ."
chesterton#"They were gone almost in a flash , but everyone could see that they were motor - cars , and the Professor stood up with a pale face and swore that they were the other two motor - cars from Dr . Renard ' s garage . "" I tell you they were his ,"" he repeated , with wild eyes , "" and they were full of men in masks !"" "" Absurd !"" said the Colonel angrily . "" Dr . Renard would never give them his cars ."" "" He may have been forced ,"" said Ratcliffe quietly ."
chesterton#""" The whole town is on their side ."" "" You still believe that ,"" asked the Colonel incredulously . "" You will all believe it soon ,"" said the other with a hopeless calm . There was a puzzled pause for some little time , and then the Colonel began again abruptly -- "" No , I can ' t believe it . The thing is nonsense ."
chesterton#"The plain people of a peaceable French town --"" He was cut short by a bang and a blaze of light , which seemed close to his eyes . As the car sped on it left a floating patch of white smoke behind it , and Syme had heard a shot shriek past his ear . "" My God !"" said the Colonel , "" someone has shot at us ."" "" It need not interrupt conversation ,"" said the gloomy Ratcliffe ."
chesterton#""" Pray resume your remarks , Colonel . You were talking , I think , about the plain people of a peaceable French town ."" The staring Colonel was long past minding satire . He rolled his eyes all round the street . "" It is extraordinary ,"" he said , "" most extraordinary ."" "" A fastidious person ,"" said Syme , "" might even call it unpleasant ."
chesterton#"However , I suppose those lights out in the field beyond this street are the Gendarmerie . We shall soon get there ."" "" No ,"" said Inspector Ratcliffe , "" we shall never get there ."" He had been standing up and looking keenly ahead of him . Now he sat down and smoothed his sleek hair with a weary gesture . "" What do you mean ?"""
chesterton#"asked Bull sharply . "" I mean that we shall never get there ,"" said the pessimist placidly . "" They have two rows of armed men across the road already ; I can see them from here . The town is in arms , as I said it was . I can only wallow in the exquisite comfort of my own exactitude ."" And Ratcliffe sat down comfortably in the car and lit a cigarette , but the others rose excitedly and stared down the road ."
chesterton#Syme had slowed down the car as their plans became doubtful , and he brought it finally to a standstill just at the corner of a side street that ran down very steeply to the sea . The town was mostly in shadow , but the sun had not sunk ; wherever its level light could break through , it painted everything a burning gold . Up this side street the last sunset light shone as sharp and narrow as the shaft of artificial light at the theatre . It struck the car of the five friends , and lit it like a burning chariot . But the rest of the street , especially the two ends of it , was in the deepest twilight , and for some seconds they could see nothing . Then Syme , whose eyes were the keenest , broke into a little bitter whistle , and said
chesterton#""" It is quite true . There is a crowd or an army or some such thing across the end of that street ."" "" Well , if there is ,"" said Bull impatiently , "" it must be something else -- a sham fight or the mayor ' s birthday or something . I cannot and will not believe that plain , jolly people in a place like this walk about with dynamite in their pockets . Get on a bit , Syme , and let us look at them ."" The car crawled about a hundred yards farther , and then they were all startled by Dr . Bull breaking into a high crow of laughter ."
chesterton#""" Why , you silly mugs !"" he cried , "" what did I tell you . That crowd ' s as law - abiding as a cow , and if it weren ' t , it ' s on our side ."" "" How do you know ?"" asked the professor , staring . "" You blind bat ,"" cried Bull , "" don ' t you see who is leading them ?"""
chesterton#"They peered again , and then the Colonel , with a catch in his voice , cried out -- "" Why , it ' s Renard !"" There was , indeed , a rank of dim figures running across the road , and they could not be clearly seen ; but far enough in front to catch the accident of the evening light was stalking up and down the unmistakable Dr . Renard , in a white hat , stroking his long brown beard , and holding a revolver in his left hand . "" What a fool I ' ve been !"" exclaimed the Colonel . "" Of course , the dear old boy has turned out to help us ."""
chesterton#"Dr . Bull was bubbling over with laughter , swinging the sword in his hand as carelessly as a cane . He jumped out of the car and ran across the intervening space , calling out -- "" Dr . Renard ! Dr . Renard !"" An instant after Syme thought his own eyes had gone mad in his head ."
chesterton#"For the philanthropic Dr . Renard had deliberately raised his revolver and fired twice at Bull , so that the shots rang down the road . Almost at the same second as the puff of white cloud went up from this atrocious explosion a long puff of white cloud went up also from the cigarette of the cynical Ratcliffe . Like all the rest he turned a little pale , but he smiled . Dr . Bull , at whom the bullets had been fired , just missing his scalp , stood quite still in the middle of the road without a sign of fear , and then turned very slowly and crawled back to the car , and climbed in with two holes through his hat . "" Well ,"" said the cigarette smoker slowly , "" what do you think now ?"" "" I think ,"" said Dr . Bull with precision , "" that I am lying in bed at No ."
chesterton#"217 Peabody Buildings , and that I shall soon wake up with a jump ; or , if that ' s not it , I think that I am sitting in a small cushioned cell in Hanwell , and that the doctor can ' t make much of my case . But if you want to know what I don ' t think , I ' ll tell you . I don ' t think what you think . I don ' t think , and I never shall think , that the mass of ordinary men are a pack of dirty modern thinkers . No , sir , I ' m a democrat , and I still don ' t believe that Sunday could convert one average navvy or counter - jumper . No , I may be mad , but humanity isn ' t ."""
chesterton#"Syme turned his bright blue eyes on Bull with an earnestness which he did not commonly make clear . "" You are a very fine fellow ,"" he said . "" You can believe in a sanity which is not merely your sanity . And you ' re right enough about humanity , about peasants and people like that jolly old innkeeper . But you ' re not right about Renard . I suspected him from the first ."

shakespeare#What dost thou with thy best Apparrell on ? You sir , what Trade are you ? Cobl . Truely Sir , in respect of a fine Workman , I am but as you would say , a Cobler Mur . But what Trade art thou ?
shakespeare#Answer me directly Cob . A Trade Sir , that I hope I may vse , with a safe Conscience , which is indeed Sir , a Mender of bad soules Fla . What Trade thou knaue ? Thou naughty knaue , what Trade ? Cobl .
shakespeare#Nay I beseech you Sir , be not out with me : yet if you be out Sir , I can mend you Mur . What mean ' st thou by that ? Mend mee , thou sawcy Fellow ? Cob . Why sir , Cobble you
shakespeare#Fla . Thou art a Cobler , art thou ? Cob . Truly sir , all that I liue by , is with the Aule : I meddle with no Tradesmans matters , nor womens matters ; but withal I am indeed Sir , a Surgeon to old shooes : when they are in great danger , I recouer them . As proper men as euer trod vpon Neats Leather , haue gone vpon my handy - worke Fla . But wherefore art not in thy Shop to day ?
shakespeare#Why do ' st thou leade these men about the streets ? Cob . Truly sir , to weare out their shooes , to get my selfe into more worke . But indeede sir , we make Holyday to see Caesar , and to reioyce in his Triumph Mur . Wherefore reioyce ?
shakespeare#What Conquest brings he home ? What Tributaries follow him to Rome , To grace in Captiue bonds his Chariot Wheeles ? You Blockes , you stones , you worse then senslesse things : O you hard hearts , you cruell men of Rome , Knew you not Pompey many a time and oft ? Haue you climb ' d vp to Walles and Battlements , To Towres and Windowes ? Yea , to Chimney tops , Your Infants in your Armes , and there haue sate The liue - long day , with patient expectation , To see great Pompey passe the streets of Rome : And when you saw his Chariot but appeare , Haue you not made an Vniuersall shout , That Tyber trembled vnderneath her bankes To heare the replication of your sounds , Made in her Concaue Shores ? And do you now put on your best attyre ?
shakespeare#And do you now cull out a Holyday ? And do you now strew Flowers in his way , That comes in Triumph ouer Pompeyes blood ? Be gone , Runne to your houses , fall vpon your knees , Pray to the Gods to intermit the plague That needs must light on this Ingratitude Fla . Go , go , good Countrymen , and for this fault Assemble all the poore men of your sort ; Draw them to Tyber bankes , and weepe your teares Into the Channell , till the lowest streame Do kisse the most exalted Shores of all . Exeunt . all the Commoners .
shakespeare#See where their basest mettle be not mou ' d , They vanish tongue - tyed in their guiltinesse : Go you downe that way towards the Capitoll , This way will I : Disrobe the Images , If you do finde them deckt with Ceremonies Mur . May we do so ? You know it is the Feast of Lupercall Fla . It is no matter , let no Images Be hung with Caesars Trophees : Ile about , And driue away the Vulgar from the streets ; So do you too , where you perceiue them thicke .
shakespeare#These growing Feathers , pluckt from Caesars wing , Will make him flye an ordinary pitch , Who else would soare aboue the view of men , And keepe vs all in seruile fearefulnesse . Exeunt . Enter Caesar , Antony for the Course , Calphurnia , Portia , Decius , Cicero , Brutus , Cassius , Caska , a Soothsayer : after them Murellus and Flauius . Caes . Calphurnia Cask .
shakespeare#Peace ho , Caesar speakes Caes . Calphurnia Calp . Heere my Lord Caes .
shakespeare#Stand you directly in Antonio ' s way , When he doth run his course . Antonio Ant . Csar , my Lord Caes . Forget not in your speed Antonio , To touch Calphurnia : for our Elders say , The Barren touched in this holy chace , Shake off their sterrile curse
shakespeare#Ant . I shall remember , When Caesar sayes , Do this ; it is perform ' d Caes . Set on , and leaue no Ceremony out Sooth . Caesar
shakespeare#Caes . Ha ? Who calles ? Cask . Bid euery noyse be still : peace yet againe Caes .
shakespeare#Who is it in the presse , that calles on me ? I heare a Tongue shriller then all the Musicke Cry , Caesar : Speake , Caesar is turn ' d to heare Sooth . Beware the Ides of March Caes . What man is that ?
shakespeare#Br . A Sooth - sayer bids you beware the Ides of March Caes . Set him before me , let me see his face Cassi . Fellow , come from the throng , look vpon Caesar Caes .
shakespeare#What sayst thou to me now ? Speak once againe , Sooth . Beware the Ides of March Caes . He is a Dreamer , let vs leaue him : Passe . Sennet
shakespeare#Exeunt . Manet Brut . & Cass . Cassi . Will you go see the order of the course ? Brut .
shakespeare#Not I Cassi . I pray you do Brut . I am not Gamesom : I do lacke some part Of that quicke Spirit that is in Antony : Let me not hinder Cassius your desires ; Ile leaue you Cassi .
shakespeare#Brutus , I do obserue you now of late : I haue not from your eyes , that gentlenesse And shew of Loue , as I was wont to haue : You beare too stubborne , and too strange a hand Ouer your Friend , that loues you Bru . Cassius , Be not deceiu ' d : If I haue veyl ' d my looke , I turne the trouble of my Countenance Meerely vpon my selfe . Vexed I am Of late , with passions of some difference , Conceptions onely proper to my selfe , Which giue some soyle ( perhaps ) to my Behauiours : But let not therefore my good Friends be greeu ' d ( Among which number Cassius be you one ) Nor construe any further my neglect , Then that poore Brutus with himselfe at warre , Forgets the shewes of Loue to other men Cassi . Then Brutus , I haue much mistook your passion , By meanes whereof , this Brest of mine hath buried Thoughts of great value , worthy Cogitations .
shakespeare#Tell me good Brutus , Can you see your face ? Brutus . No Cassius : For the eye sees not it selfe but by reflection , By some other things Cassius . ' Tis iust , And it is very much lamented Brutus , That you haue no such Mirrors , as will turne Your hidden worthinesse into your eye , That you might see your shadow : I haue heard , Where many of the best respect in Rome , ( Except immortall Caesar ) speaking of Brutus , And groaning vnderneath this Ages yoake , Haue wish ' d , that Noble Brutus had his eyes Bru .
shakespeare#Into what dangers , would you Leade me Cassius ? That you would haue me seeke into my selfe , For that which is not in me ? Cas . Therefore good Brutus , be prepar ' d to heare : And since you know , you cannot see your selfe So well as by Reflection ; I your Glasse , Will modestly discouer to your selfe That of your selfe , which you yet know not of . And be not iealous on me , gentle Brutus : Were I a common Laughter , or did vse To stale with ordinary Oathes my loue To euery new Protester : if you know , That I do fawne on men , and hugge them hard , And after scandall them : Or if you know , That I professe my selfe in Banquetting To all the Rout , then hold me dangerous . Flourish , and Shout .
shakespeare#Bru . What meanes this Showting ? I do feare , the People choose Caesar For their King Cassi . I , do you feare it ? Then must I thinke you would not haue it so
shakespeare#Bru . I would not Cassius , yet I loue him well : But wherefore do you hold me heere so long ? What is it , that you would impart to me ? If it be ought toward the generall good , Set Honor in one eye , and Death i ' th other , And I will looke on both indifferently : For let the Gods so speed mee , as I loue The name of Honor , more then I feare death Cassi . I know that vertue to be in you Brutus , As well as I do know your outward fauour .
shakespeare#Well , Honor is the subiect of my Story : I cannot tell , what you and other men Thinke of this life : But for my single selfe , I had as liefe not be , as liue to be In awe of such a Thing , as I my selfe . I was borne free as Caesar , so were you , We both haue fed as well , and we can both Endure the Winters cold , as well as hee . For once , vpon a Rawe and Gustie day , The troubled Tyber , chafing with her Shores , Caesar saide to me , Dar ' st thou Cassius now Leape in with me into this angry Flood , And swim to yonder Point ? Vpon the word , Accoutred as I was , I plunged in , And bad him follow : so indeed he did . The Torrent roar ' d , and we did buffet it With lusty Sinewes , throwing it aside , And stemming it with hearts of Controuersie . But ere we could arriue the Point propos ' d , Caesar cride , Helpe me Cassius , or I sinke .
shakespeare#I ( as Aeneas , our great Ancestor , Did from the Flames of Troy , vpon his shoulder The old Anchyses beare ) so , from the waues of Tyber Did I the tyred Caesar : And this Man , Is now become a God , and Cassius is A wretched Creature , and must bend his body , If Caesar carelesly but nod on him . He had a Feauer when he was in Spaine , And when the Fit was on him , I did marke How he did shake : Tis true , this God did shake , His Coward lippes did from their colour flye , And that same Eye , whose bend doth awe the World , Did loose his Lustre : I did heare him grone : I , and that Tongue of his , that bad the Romans Marke him , and write his Speeches in their Bookes , Alas , it cried , Giue me some drinke Titinius , As a sicke Girle : Ye Gods , it doth amaze me , A man of such a feeble temper should So get the start of the Maiesticke world , And beare the Palme alone . Shout . Flourish . Bru . Another generall shout ?
shakespeare#I do beleeue , that these applauses are For some new Honors , that are heap ' d on Caesar Cassi . Why man , he doth bestride the narrow world Like a Colossus , and we petty men Walke vnder his huge legges , and peepe about To finde our selues dishonourable Graues . Men at sometime , are Masters of their Fates . The fault ( deere Brutus ) is not in our Starres , But in our Selues , that we are vnderlings . Brutus and Caesar : What should be in that Caesar ?
shakespeare#Why should that name be sounded more then yours Write them together : Yours , is as faire a Name : Sound them , it doth become the mouth aswell : Weigh them , it is as heauy : Coniure with ' em , Brutus will start a Spirit as soone as Caesar . Now in the names of all the Gods at once , Vpon what meate doth this our Caesar feede , That he is growne so great ? Age , thou art sham ' d . Rome , thou hast lost the breed of Noble Bloods . When went there by an Age , since the great Flood , But it was fam ' d with more then with one man ? When could they say ( till now ) that talk ' d of Rome , That her wide Walkes incompast but one man ?
shakespeare#Now is it Rome indeed , and Roome enough When there is in it but one onely man . O ! you and I , haue heard our Fathers say , There was a Brutus once , that would haue brook ' d Th ' eternall Diuell to keepe his State in Rome , As easily as a King Bru . That you do loue me , I am nothing iealous : What you would worke me too , I haue some ayme : How I haue thought of this , and of these times I shall recount heereafter . For this present , I would not so ( with loue I might intreat you ) Be any further moou ' d : What you haue said , I will consider : what you haue to say I will with patience heare , and finde a time Both meete to heare , and answer such high things .
shakespeare#Till then , my Noble Friend , chew vpon this : Brutus had rather be a Villager , Then to repute himselfe a Sonne of Rome Vnder these hard Conditions , as this time Is like to lay vpon vs Cassi . I am glad that my weake words Haue strucke but thus much shew of fire from Brutus , Enter Caesar and his Traine . Bru . The Games are done , And Caesar is returning Cassi .
shakespeare#As they passe by , Plucke Caska by the Sleeue , And he will ( after his sowre fashion ) tell you What hath proceeded worthy note to day Bru . I will do so : but looke you Cassius , The angry spot doth glow on Caesars brow , And all the rest , looke like a chidden Traine ; Calphurnia ' s Cheeke is pale , and Cicero Lookes with such Ferret , and such fiery eyes As we haue seene him in the Capitoll Being crost in Conference , by some Senators Cassi . Caska will tell vs what the matter is Caes Antonio
shakespeare#Ant . Caesar Caes Let me haue men about me , that are fat , Sleeke - headed men , and such as sleepe a - nights : Yond Cassius has a leane and hungry looke , He thinkes too much : such men are dangerous Ant . Feare him not Caesar , he ' s not dangerous , He is a Noble Roman , and well giuen Caes Would he were fatter ; But I feare him not : Yet if my name were lyable to feare , I do not know the man I should auoyd So soone as that spare Cassius .
shakespeare#He reades much , He is a great Obseruer , and he lookes Quite through the Deeds of men . He loues no Playes , As thou dost Antony : he heares no Musicke ; Seldome he smiles , and smiles in such a sort As if he mock ' d himselfe , and scorn ' d his spirit That could be mou ' d to smile at any thing . Such men as he , be neuer at hearts ease , Whiles they behold a greater then themselues , And therefore are they very dangerous . I rather tell thee what is to be fear ' d , Then what I feare : for alwayes I am Caesar . Come on my right hand , for this eare is deafe , And tell me truely , what thou think ' st of him . Sennit .
shakespeare#Exeunt . Caesar and his Traine . Cask . You pul ' d me by the cloake , would you speake with me ? Bru . I Caska , tell vs what hath chanc ' d to day That Caesar lookes so sad
shakespeare#Cask . Why you were with him , were you not ? Bru . I should not then aske Caska what had chanc ' d Cask . Why there was a Crowne offer ' d him ; & being offer ' d him , he put it by with the backe of his hand thus , and then the people fell a shouting
shakespeare#Bru . What was the second noyse for ? Cask . Why for that too Cassi . They shouted thrice : what was the last cry for ?
shakespeare#Cask . Why for that too Bru . Was the Crowne offer ' d him thrice ? Cask . I marry was ' t , and hee put it by thrice , euerie time gentler then other ; and at euery putting by , mine honest Neighbors showted
shakespeare#Cassi . Who offer ' d him the Crowne ? Cask . Why Antony Bru . Tell vs the manner of it , gentle Caska
shakespeare#Caska . I can as well bee hang ' d as tell the manner of it : It was meere Foolerie , I did not marke it . I sawe Marke Antony offer him a Crowne , yet ' twas not a Crowne neyther , ' twas one of these Coronets : and as I told you , hee put it by once : but for all that , to my thinking , he would faine haue had it . Then hee offered it to him againe : then hee put it by againe : but to my thinking , he was very loath to lay his fingers off it . And then he offered it the third time ; hee put it the third time by , and still as hee refus ' d it , the rabblement howted , and clapp ' d their chopt hands , and threw vppe their sweatie Night - cappes , and vttered such a deale of stinking breath , because Caesar refus ' d the Crowne , that it had ( almost ) choaked Caesar : for hee swoonded , and fell downe at it : And for mine owne part , I durst not laugh , for feare of opening my Lippes , and receyuing the bad Ayre Cassi .
shakespeare#But soft I pray you : what , did Caesar swound ? Cask . He fell downe in the Market - place , and foam ' d at mouth , and was speechlesse Brut . ' Tis very like he hath the Falling sicknesse Cassi .
shakespeare#No , Caesar hath it not : but you , and I , And honest Caska , we haue the Falling sicknesse Cask . I know not what you meane by that , but I am sure Caesar fell downe . If the tag - ragge people did not clap him , and hisse him , according as he pleas ' d , and displeas ' d them , as they vse to doe the Players in the Theatre , I am no true man Brut . What said he , when he came vnto himselfe ?
shakespeare#Cask . Marry , before he fell downe , when he perceiu ' d the common Heard was glad he refus ' d the Crowne , he pluckt me ope his Doublet , and offer ' d them his Throat to cut : and I had beene a man of any Occupation , if I would not haue taken him at a word , I would I might goe to Hell among the Rogues , and so hee fell . When he came to himselfe againe , hee said , If hee had done , or said any thing amisse , he desir ' d their Worships to thinke it was his infirmitie . Three or foure Wenches where I stood , cryed , Alasse good Soule , and forgaue him with all their hearts : But there ' s no heed to be taken of them ; if Caesar had stab ' d their Mothers , they would haue done no lesse Brut . And after that , he came thus sad away
shakespeare#Cask . I Cassi . Did Cicero say any thing ? Cask . I , he spoke Greeke
shakespeare#Cassi . To what effect ? Cask . Nay , and I tell you that , Ile ne ' re looke you i ' th ' face againe . But those that vnderstood him , smil ' d at one another , and shooke their heads : but for mine owne part , it was Greeke to me . I could tell you more newes too : Murrellus and Flauius , for pulling Scarffes off Caesars Images , are put to silence .
shakespeare#Fare you well . There was more Foolerie yet , if I could remember it Cassi . Will you suppe with me to Night , Caska ? Cask . No , I am promis ' d forth
shakespeare#Cassi . Will you Dine with me to morrow ? Cask . I , if I be aliue , and your minde hold , and your Dinner worth the eating Cassi . Good , I will expect you
shakespeare#Cask . Doe so : farewell both . Enter . Brut . What a blunt fellow is this growne to be ? He was quick Mettle , when he went to Schoole
shakespeare#Cassi . So is he now , in execution Of any bold , or Noble Enterprize , How - euer he puts on this tardie forme : This Rudenesse is a Sawce to his good Wit , Which giues men stomacke to disgest his words With better Appetite Brut . And so it is : For this time I will leaue you : To morrow , if you please to speake with me , I will come home to you : or if you will , Come home to me , and I will wait for you Cassi . I will doe so : till then , thinke of the World .
shakespeare#Exit Brutus . Well Brutus , thou art Noble : yet I see , Thy Honorable Mettle may be wrought From that it is dispos ' d : therefore it is meet , That Noble mindes keepe euer with their likes : For who so firme , that cannot be seduc ' d ? Caesar doth beare me hard , but he loues Brutus . If I were Brutus now , and he were Cassius , He should not humor me . I will this Night , In seuerall Hands , in at his Windowes throw , As if they came from seuerall Citizens , Writings , all tending to the great opinion That Rome holds of his Name : wherein obscurely Caesars Ambition shall be glanced at . And after this , let Caesar seat him sure , For wee will shake him , or worse dayes endure .
shakespeare#Enter . Thunder , and Lightning . Enter Caska , and Cicero . Cic . Good euen , Caska : brought you Caesar home ? Why are you breathlesse , and why stare you so ?
shakespeare#Cask . Are not you mou ' d , when all the sway of Earth Shakes , like a thing vnfirme ? O Cicero , I haue seene Tempests , when the scolding Winds Haue riu ' d the knottie Oakes , and I haue seene Th ' ambitious Ocean swell , and rage , and foame , To be exalted with the threatning Clouds : But neuer till to Night , neuer till now , Did I goe through a Tempest - dropping - fire . Eyther there is a Ciuill strife in Heauen , Or else the World , too sawcie with the Gods , Incenses them to send destruction Cic . Why , saw you any thing more wonderfull ?
shakespeare#Cask . A common slaue , you know him well by sight , Held vp his left Hand , which did flame and burne Like twentie Torches ioyn ' d ; and yet his Hand , Not sensible of fire , remain ' d vnscorch ' d . Besides , I ha ' not since put vp my Sword , Against the Capitoll I met a Lyon , Who glaz ' d vpon me , and went surly by , Without annoying me . And there were drawne Vpon a heape , a hundred gastly Women , Transformed with their feare , who swore , they saw Men , all in fire , walke vp and downe the streetes . And yesterday , the Bird of Night did sit , Euen at Noone - day , vpon the Market place , Howting , and shreeking . When these Prodigies Doe so conioyntly meet , let not men say , These are their Reasons , they are Naturall : For I beleeue , they are portentous things Vnto the Clymate , that they point vpon
shakespeare#Cic . Indeed , it is a strange disposed time : But men may construe things after their fashion , Cleane from the purpose of the things themselues . Comes Caesar to the Capitoll to morrow ? Cask . He doth : for he did bid Antonio Send word to you , he would be there to morrow Cic .
shakespeare#Good - night then , Caska : This disturbed Skie is not to walke in Cask . Farewell Cicero . Exit Cicero . Enter Cassius . Cassi .
shakespeare#Who ' s there ? Cask . A Romane Cassi . Caska , by your Voyce Cask .
shakespeare#Your Eare is good . Cassius , what Night is this ? Cassi . A very pleasing Night to honest men Cask . Who euer knew the Heauens menace so ?
shakespeare#Cassi . Those that haue knowne the Earth so full of faults . For my part , I haue walk ' d about the streets , Submitting me vnto the perillous Night ; And thus vnbraced , Caska , as you see , Haue bar ' d my Bosome to the Thunder - stone : And when the crosse blew Lightning seem ' d to open The Brest of Heauen , I did present my selfe Euen in the ayme , and very flash of it Cask . But wherefore did you so much tempt the Heauens ? It is the part of men , to feare and tremble , When the most mightie Gods , by tokens send Such dreadfull Heraulds , to astonish vs
shakespeare#Cassi . You are dull , Caska : And those sparkes of Life , that should be in a Roman , You doe want , or else you vse not . You looke pale , and gaze , and put on feare , And cast your selfe in wonder , To see the strange impatience of the Heauens : But if you would consider the true cause , Why all these Fires , why all these gliding Ghosts , Why Birds and Beasts , from qualitie and kinde , Why Old men , Fooles , and Children calculate , Why all these things change from their Ordinance , Their Natures , and pre - formed Faculties , To monstrous qualitie ; why you shall finde , That Heauen hath infus ' d them with these Spirits , To make them Instruments of feare , and warning , Vnto some monstrous State . Now could I ( Caska ) name to thee a man , Most like this dreadfull Night , That Thunders , Lightens , opens Graues , and roares , As doth the Lyon in the Capitoll : A man no mightier then thy selfe , or me , In personall action ; yet prodigious growne , And fearefull , as these strange eruptions are Cask . ' Tis Caesar that you meane : Is it not , Cassius ?
shakespeare#Cassi . Let it be who it is : for Romans now Haue Thewes , and Limbes , like to their Ancestors ; But woe the while , our Fathers mindes are dead , And we are gouern ' d with our Mothers spirits , Our yoake , and sufferance , shew vs Womanish Cask . Indeed , they say , the Senators to morrow Meane to establish Caesar as a King : And he shall weare his Crowne by Sea , and Land , In euery place , saue here in Italy Cassi . I know where I will weare this Dagger then ; Cassius from Bondage will deliuer Cassius : Therein , yee Gods , you make the weake most strong ; Therein , yee Gods , you Tyrants doe defeat .
shakespeare#Nor Stonie Tower , nor Walls of beaten Brasse , Nor ayre - lesse Dungeon , nor strong Linkes of Iron , Can be retentiue to the strength of spirit : But Life being wearie of these worldly Barres , Neuer lacks power to dismisse it selfe . If I know this , know all the World besides , That part of Tyrannie that I doe beare , I can shake off at pleasure . Thunder still . Cask . So can I : So euery Bond - man in his owne hand beares The power to cancell his Captiuitie Cassi .
shakespeare#And why should Csar be a Tyrant then ? Poore man , I know he would not be a Wolfe , But that he sees the Romans are but Sheepe : He were no Lyon , were not Romans Hindes . Those that with haste will make a mightie fire , Begin it with weake Strawes . What trash is Rome ? What Rubbish , and what Offall ? when it serues For the base matter , to illuminate So vile a thing as Caesar .
shakespeare#But oh Griefe , Where hast thou led me ? I ( perhaps ) speake this Before a willing Bond - man : then I know My answere must be made . But I am arm ' d , And dangers are to me indifferent Cask . You speake to Caska , and to such a man , That is no flearing Tell - tale . Hold , my Hand : Be factious for redresse of all these Griefes , And I will set this foot of mine as farre , As who goes farthest
shakespeare#Cassi . There ' s a Bargaine made . Now know you , Caska , I haue mou ' d already Some certaine of the Noblest minded Romans To vnder - goe , with me , an Enterprize , Of Honorable dangerous consequence ; And I doe know by this , they stay for me In Pompeyes Porch : for now this fearefull Night , There is no stirre , or walking in the streetes ; And the Complexion of the Element Is Fauors , like the Worke we haue in hand , Most bloodie , fierie , and most terrible . Enter Cinna . Caska . Stand close a while , for heere comes one in haste
shakespeare#Cassi . ' Tis Cinna , I doe know him by his Gate , He is a friend . Cinna , where haste you so ? Cinna . To finde out you : Who ' s that , Metellus Cymber ? Cassi .
shakespeare#No , it is Caska , one incorporate To our Attempts . Am I not stay ' d for , Cinna ? Cinna . I am glad on ' t . What a fearefull Night is this ? There ' s two or three of vs haue seene strange sights
shakespeare#Cassi . Am I not stay ' d for ? tell me Cinna . Yes , you are . O Cassius , If you could but winne the Noble Brutus To our party - Cassi .
shakespeare#Be you content . Good Cinna , take this Paper , And looke you lay it in the Pretors Chayre , Where Brutus may but finde it : and throw this In at his Window ; set this vp with Waxe Vpon old Brutus Statue : all this done , Repaire to Pompeyes Porch , where you shall finde vs . Is Decius Brutus and Trebonius there ? Cinna . All , but Metellus Cymber , and hee ' s gone To seeke you at your house . Well , I will hie , And so bestow these Papers as you bad me Cassi .
shakespeare#That done , repayre to Pompeyes Theater . Exit Cinna . Come Caska , you and I will yet , ere day , See Brutus at his house : three parts of him Is ours alreadie , and the man entire Vpon the next encounter , yeelds him ours Cask . O , he sits high in all the Peoples hearts : And that which would appeare Offence in vs , His Countenance , like richest Alchymie , Will change to Vertue , and to Worthinesse Cassi .
shakespeare#Him , and his worth , and our great need of him , You haue right well conceited : let vs goe , For it is after Mid - night , and ere day , We will awake him , and be sure of him . Exeunt . Actus Secundus . Enter Brutus in his Orchard . Brut . What Lucius , hoe ?
shakespeare#I cannot , by the progresse of the Starres , Giue guesse how neere to day - Lucius , I say ? I would it were my fault to sleepe so soundly . When Lucius , when ? awake , I say : what Lucius ? Enter Lucius . Luc .
shakespeare#Call ' d you , my Lord ? Brut . Get me a Tapor in my Study , Lucius : When it is lighted , come and call me here Luc . I will , my Lord . Enter .
shakespeare#Brut . It must be by his death : and for my part , I know no personall cause , to spurne at him , But for the generall . He would be crown ' d : How that might change his nature , there ' s the question ? It is the bright day , that brings forth the Adder , And that craues warie walking : Crowne him that , And then I graunt we put a Sting in him , That at his will he may doe danger with . Th ' abuse of Greatnesse , is , when it dis - ioynes Remorse from Power : And to speake truth of Caesar , I haue not knowne , when his Affections sway ' d More then his Reason . But ' tis a common proofe , That Lowlynesse is young Ambitions Ladder , Whereto the Climber vpward turnes his Face : But when he once attaines the vpmost Round , He then vnto the Ladder turnes his Backe , Lookes in the Clouds , scorning the base degrees By which he did ascend : so Caesar may ; Then least he may , preuent .
shakespeare#And since the Quarrell Will beare no colour , for the thing he is , Fashion it thus ; that what he is , augmented , Would runne to these , and these extremities : And therefore thinke him as a Serpents egge , Which hatch ' d , would as his kinde grow mischieuous ; And kill him in the shell . Enter Lucius . Luc . The Taper burneth in your Closet , Sir : Searching the Window for a Flint , I found This Paper , thus seal ' d vp , and I am sure It did not lye there when I went to Bed . Giues him the Letter . Brut .
shakespeare#Get you to Bed againe , it is not day : Is not to morrow ( Boy ) the first of March ? Luc . I know not , Sir Brut . Looke in the Calender , and bring me word Luc .
shakespeare#I will , Sir . Enter . Brut . The exhalations , whizzing in the ayre , Giue so much light , that I may reade by them . Opens the Letter , and reades . Brutus thou sleep ' st ; awake , and see thy selfe : Shall Rome , & c . speake , strike , redresse .
shakespeare#Brutus , thou sleep ' st : awake . Such instigations haue beene often dropt , Where I haue tooke them vp : Shall Rome , & c .

Am I entreated To speake , and strike ?
shakespeare#O Rome , I make thee promise , If the redresse will follow , thou receiuest Thy full Petition at the hand of Brutus . Enter Lucius . Luc . Sir , March is wasted fifteene dayes . Knocke within . Brut .
shakespeare#' Tis good . Go to the Gate , some body knocks : Since Cassius first did whet me against Caesar , I haue not slept . Betweene the acting of a dreadfull thing , And the first motion , all the Interim is Like a Phantasma , or a hideous Dreame : The Genius , and the mortall Instruments Are then in councell ; and the state of a man , Like to a little Kingdome , suffers then The nature of an Insurrection . Enter Lucius . Luc . Sir , ' tis your Brother Cassius at the Doore , Who doth desire to see you
shakespeare#Brut . Is he alone ? Luc . No , Sir , there are moe with him Brut . Doe you know them ?
shakespeare#Luc . No , Sir , their Hats are pluckt about their Eares , And halfe their Faces buried in their Cloakes , That by no meanes I may discouer them , By any marke of fauour Brut . Let ' em enter : They are the Faction . O Conspiracie , Sham ' st thou to shew thy dang ' rous Brow by Night , When euills are most free ? O then , by day Where wilt thou finde a Cauerne darke enough , To maske thy monstrous Visage ?
shakespeare#Seek none Conspiracie , Hide it in Smiles , and Affabilitie : For if thou path thy natiue semblance on , Not Erebus it selfe were dimme enough , To hide thee from preuention . Enter the Conspirators , Cassius , Caska , Decius , Cinna , Metellus , and Trebonius . Cass . I thinke we are too bold vpon your Rest : Good morrow Brutus , doe we trouble you ? Brut . I haue beene vp this howre , awake all Night : Know I these men , that come along with you ?
shakespeare#Cass . Yes , euery man of them ; and no man here But honors you : and euery one doth wish , You had but that opinion of your selfe , Which euery Noble Roman beares of you . This is Trebonius Brut . He is welcome hither Cass .
shakespeare#This , Decius Brutus Brut . He is welcome too Cass . This , Caska ; this , Cinna ; and this , Metellus Cymber Brut .
shakespeare#They are all welcome . What watchfull Cares doe interpose themselues Betwixt your Eyes , and Night ? Cass . Shall I entreat a word ? They whisper . Decius .

shakespeare#You shall confesse , that you are both deceiu ' d : Heere , as I point my Sword , the Sunne arises , Which is a great way growing on the South , Weighing the youthfull Season of the yeare . Some two moneths hence , vp higher toward the North He first presents his fire , and the high East Stands as the Capitoll , directly heere Bru . Giue me your hands all ouer , one by one Cas . And let vs sweare our Resolution
shakespeare#Brut . No , not an Oath : if not the Face of men , The sufferance of our Soules , the times Abuse ; If these be Motiues weake , breake off betimes , And euery man hence , to his idle bed : So let high - sighted - Tyranny range on , Till each man drop by Lottery . But if these ( As I am sure they do ) beare fire enough To kindle Cowards , and to steele with valour The melting Spirits of women . Then Countrymen , What neede we any spurre , but our owne cause To pricke vs to redresse ? What other Bond , Then secret Romans , that haue spoke the word , And will not palter ? And what other Oath , Then Honesty to Honesty ingag ' d , That this shall be , or we will fall for it .
shakespeare#Sweare Priests and Cowards , and men Cautelous Old feeble Carrions , and such suffering Soules That welcome wrongs : Vnto bad causes , sweare Such Creatures as men doubt ; but do not staine The euen vertue of our Enterprize , Nor th ' insuppressiue Mettle of our Spirits , To thinke , that or our Cause , or our Performance Did neede an Oath . When euery drop of blood That euery Roman beares , and Nobly beares Is guilty of a seuerall Bastardie , If he do breake the smallest Particle Of any promise that hath past from him Cas . But what of Cicero ? Shall we sound him ? I thinke he will stand very strong with vs
shakespeare#Cask . Let vs not leaue him out Cyn . No , by no meanes Metel . O let vs haue him , for his Siluer haires Will purchase vs a good opinion : And buy mens voyces , to commend our deeds : It shall be sayd , his iudgement rul ' d our hands , Our youths , and wildenesse , shall no whit appeare , But all be buried in his Grauity
shakespeare#Bru . O name him not ; let vs not breake with him , For he will neuer follow any thing That other men begin Cas . Then leaue him out Cask . Indeed , he is not fit
shakespeare#Decius . Shall no man else be toucht , but onely Caesar ? Cas . Decius well vrg ' d : I thinke it is not meet , Marke Antony , so well belou ' d of Caesar , Should out - liue Caesar , we shall finde of him A shrew ' d Contriuer . And you know , his meanes If he improue them , may well stretch so farre As to annoy vs all : which to preuent , Let Antony and Caesar fall together Bru .
shakespeare#Our course will seeme too bloody , Caius Cassius , To cut the Head off , and then hacke the Limbes : Like Wrath in death , and Enuy afterwards : For Antony , is but a Limbe of Caesar . Let ' s be Sacrificers , but not Butchers Caius : We all stand vp against the spirit of Caesar , And in the Spirit of men , there is no blood : O that we then could come by Caesars Spirit , And not dismember Caesar ! But ( alas ) Caesar must bleed for it . And gentle Friends , Let ' s kill him Boldly , but not Wrathfully : Let ' s carue him , as a Dish fit for the Gods , Not hew him as a Carkasse fit for Hounds : And let our Hearts , as subtle Masters do , Stirre vp their Seruants to an acte of Rage , And after seeme to chide ' em . This shall make Our purpose Necessary , and not Enuious . Which so appearing to the common eyes , We shall be call ' d Purgers , not Murderers .
shakespeare#And for Marke Antony , thinke not of him : For he can do no more then Caesars Arme , When Caesars head is off Cas . Yet I feare him , For in the ingrafted loue he beares to Caesar Bru . Alas , good Cassius , do not thinke of him : If he loue Caesar , all that he can do Is to himselfe ; take thought , and dye for Caesar , And that were much he should : for he is giuen To sports , to wildenesse , and much company Treb .
shakespeare#There is no feare in him ; let him not dye , For he will liue , and laugh at this heereafter . Clocke strikes . Bru . Peace , count the Clocke Cas . The Clocke hath stricken three
shakespeare#Treb . ' Tis time to part Cass . But it is doubtfull yet , Whether Caesar will come forth to day , or no : For he is Superstitious growne of late , Quite from the maine Opinion he held once , Of Fantasie , of Dreames , and Ceremonies : It may be , these apparant Prodigies , The vnaccustom ' d Terror of this night , And the perswasion of his Augurers , May hold him from the Capitoll to day Decius . Neuer feare that : If he be so resolu ' d , I can ore - sway him : For he loues to heare , That Vnicornes may be betray ' d with Trees , And Beares with Glasses , Elephants with Holes , Lyons with Toyles , and men with Flatterers .
shakespeare#But , when I tell him , he hates Flatterers , He sayes , he does ; being then most flattered . Let me worke : For I can giue his humour the true bent ; And I will bring him to the Capitoll Cas . Nay , we will all of vs , be there to fetch him Bru . By the eight houre , is that the vttermost ?
shakespeare#Cin . Be that the vttermost , and faile not then Met . Caius Ligarius doth beare Caesar hard , Who rated him for speaking well of Pompey ; I wonder none of you haue thought of him Bru . Now good Metellus go along by him : He loues me well , and I haue giuen him Reasons , Send him but hither , and Ile fashion him

shakespeare#I vrg ' d you further , then you scratch ' d your head , And too impatiently stampt with your foote : Yet I insisted , yet you answer ' d not , But with an angry wafter of your hand Gaue signe for me to leaue you : So I did , Fearing to strengthen that impatience Which seem ' d too much inkindled ; and withall , Hoping it was but an effect of Humor , Which sometime hath his houre with euery man . It will not let you eate , nor talke , nor sleepe ; And could it worke so much vpon your shape , As it hath much preuayl ' d on your Condition , I should not know you Brutus . Deare my Lord , Make me acquainted with your cause of greefe Bru . I am not well in health , and that is all Por .

shakespeare#What , is Brutus sicke ? And will he steale out of his wholsome bed To dare the vile contagion of the Night ? And tempt the Rhewmy , and vnpurged Ayre , To adde vnto his sicknesse ? No my Brutus , You haue some sicke Offence within your minde , Which by the Right and Vertue of my place I ought to know of : And vpon my knees , I charme you , by my once commended Beauty , By all your vowes of Loue , and that great Vow Which did incorporate and make vs one , That you vnfold to me , your selfe ; your halfe Why you are heauy : and what men to night Haue had resort to you : for heere haue beene Some sixe or seuen , who did hide their faces Euen from darknesse Bru . Kneele not gentle Portia

shakespeare#You shall not stirre out of your house to day Caes Caesar shall forth ; the things that threaten ' d me , Ne ' re look ' d but on my backe : When they shall see The face of Caesar , they are vanished Calp . Caesar , I neuer stood on Ceremonies , Yet now they fright me : There is one within , Besides the things that we haue heard and seene , Recounts most horrid sights seene by the Watch . A Lionnesse hath whelped in the streets , And Graues haue yawn ' d , and yeelded vp their dead ; Fierce fiery Warriours fight vpon the Clouds In Rankes and Squadrons , and right forme of Warre Which drizel ' d blood vpon the Capitoll : The noise of Battell hurtled in the Ayre : Horsses do neigh , and dying men did grone , And Ghosts did shrieke and squeale about the streets . O Caesar , these things are beyond all vse , And I do feare them
shakespeare#Caes What can be auoyded Whose end is purpos ' d by the mighty Gods ? Yet Caesar shall go forth : for these Predictions Are to the world in generall , as to Caesar Calp . When Beggers dye , there are no Comets seen , The Heauens themselues blaze forth the death of Princes Caes Cowards dye many times before their deaths , The valiant neuer taste of death but once : Of all the Wonders that I yet haue heard , It seemes to me most strange that men should feare , Seeing that death , a necessary end Will come , when it will come . Enter a Seruant . What say the Augurers ?
shakespeare#Ser . They would not haue you to stirre forth to day . Plucking the intrailes of an Offering forth , They could not finde a heart within the beast Caes The Gods do this in shame of Cowardice : Caesar should be a Beast without a heart If he should stay at home to day for feare : No Caesar shall not ; Danger knowes full well That Caesar is more dangerous then he . We heare two Lyons litter ' d in one day , And I the elder and more terrible , And Caesar shall go foorth Calp .
shakespeare#Alas my Lord , Your wisedome is consum ' d in confidence : Do not go forth to day : Call it my feare , That keepes you in the house , and not your owne . Wee ' l send Mark Antony to the Senate house , And he shall say , you are not well to day : Let me vpon my knee , preuaile in this Caes Mark Antony shall say I am not well , And for thy humor , I will stay at home .

Say he is sicke Caes Shall Caesar send a Lye ? Haue I in Conquest stretcht mine Arme so farre , To be afear ' d to tell Gray - beards the truth : Decius , go tell them , Caesar will not come
shakespeare#Deci . Most mighty Caesar , let me know some cause , Lest I be laught at when I tell them so Caes The cause is in my Will , I will not come , That is enough to satisfie the Senate . But for your priuate satisfaction , Because I loue you , I will let you know . Calphurnia heere my wife , stayes me at home : She dreampt to night , she saw my Statue , Which like a Fountaine , with an hundred spouts Did run pure blood : and many lusty Romans Came smiling , & did bathe their hands in it : And these does she apply , for warnings and portents , And euils imminent ; and on her knee Hath begg ' d , that I will stay at home to day Deci .
shakespeare#This Dreame is all amisse interpreted , It was a vision , faire and fortunate : Your Statue spouting blood in many pipes , In which so many smiling Romans bath ' d , Signifies , that from you great Rome shall sucke Reuiuing blood , and that great men shall presse For Tinctures , Staines , Reliques , and Cognisance . This by Calphurnia ' s Dreame is signified Caes And this way haue you well expounded it Deci . I haue , when you haue heard what I can say : And know it now , the Senate haue concluded To giue this day , a Crowne to mighty Caesar . If you shall send them word you will not come , Their mindes may change .
shakespeare#Besides , it were a mocke Apt to be render ' d , for some one to say , Breake vp the Senate , till another time : When Caesars wife shall meete with better Dreames . If Caesar hide himselfe , shall they not whisper Loe Caesar is affraid ? Pardon me Caesar , for my deere deere loue To your proceeding , bids me tell you this : And reason to my loue is liable Caes How foolish do your fears seeme now Calphurnia ? I am ashamed I did yeeld to them . Giue me my Robe , for I will go .

I do beseech yee , if you beare me hard , Now , whil ' st your purpled hands do reeke and smoake , Fulfill your pleasure . Liue a thousand yeeres , I shall not finde my selfe so apt to dye .

Gentlemen all : Alas , what shall I say , My credit now stands on such slippery ground , That one of two bad wayes you must conceit me , Either a Coward , or a Flatterer . That I did loue thee Caesar , O ' tis true : If then thy Spirit looke vpon vs now , Shall it not greeue thee deerer then thy death , To see thy Antony making his peace , Shaking the bloody fingers of thy Foes ? Most Noble , in the presence of thy Coarse , Had I as many eyes , as thou hast wounds , Weeping as fast as they streame forth thy blood , It would become me better , then to close In tearmes of Friendship with thine enemies .

You all did see , that on the Lupercall , I thrice presented him a Kingly Crowne , Which he did thrice refuse . Was this Ambition ? Yet Brutus sayes , he was Ambitious : And sure he is an Honourable man . I speake not to disprooue what Brutus spoke , But heere I am , to speake what I do know ; You all did loue him once , not without cause , What cause with - holds you then , to mourne for him ?

But heere ' s a Parchment , with the Seale of Caesar , I found it in his Closset , ' tis his Will : Let but the Commons heare this Testament : ( Which pardon me ) I do not meane to reade , And they would go and kisse dead Caesars wounds , And dip their Napkins in his Sacred Blood ; Yea , begge a haire of him for Memory , And dying , mention it within their Willes , Bequeathing it as a rich Legacie Vnto their issue

Iudge , O you Gods , how deerely Caesar lou ' d him : This was the most vnkindest cut of all . For when the Noble Caesar saw him stab , Ingratitude , more strong then Traitors armes , Quite vanquish ' d him : then burst his Mighty heart , And in his Mantle , muffling vp his face , Euen at the Base of Pompeyes Statue ( Which all the while ran blood ) great Caesar fell .

There is no terror Cassius in your threats : For I am Arm ' d so strong in Honesty , That they passe by me , as the idle winde , Which I respect not . I did send to you For certaine summes of Gold , which you deny ' d me , For I can raise no money by vile meanes : By Heauen , I had rather Coine my Heart , And drop my blood for Drachmaes , then to wring From the hard hands of Peazants , their vile trash By any indirection . I did send To you for Gold to pay my Legions , Which you deny ' d me : was that done like Cassius ? Should I haue answer ' d Caius Cassius so ?

O I could weepe My Spirit from mine eyes . There is my Dagger , And heere my naked Breast : Within , a Heart Deerer then Pluto ' s Mine , Richer then Gold : If that thou bee ' st a Roman , take it foorth .

Hath Cassius liu ' d To be but Mirth and Laughter to his Brutus , When greefe and blood ill temper ' d , vexeth him ? Bru .

shakespeare#Though yet of Hamlet our deere Brothers death The memory be greene : and that it vs befitted To beare our hearts in greefe , and our whole Kingdome To be contracted in one brow of woe : Yet so farre hath Discretion fought with Nature , That we with wisest sorrow thinke on him , Together with remembrance of our selues . Therefore our sometimes Sister , now our Queene , Th ' imperiall Ioyntresse of this warlike State , Haue we , as ' twere , with a defeated ioy , With one Auspicious , and one Dropping eye , With mirth in Funerall , and with Dirge in Marriage , In equall Scale weighing Delight and Dole Taken to Wife ; nor haue we heerein barr ' d Your better Wisedomes , which haue freely gone With this affaire along , for all our Thankes . Now followes , that you know young Fortinbras , Holding a weake supposall of our worth ; Or thinking by our late deere Brothers death , Our State to be disioynt , and out of Frame , Colleagued with the dreame of his Aduantage ; He hath not fayl ' d to pester vs with Message , Importing the surrender of those Lands Lost by his Father : with all Bonds of Law To our most valiant Brother . So much for him . Enter Voltemand and Cornelius . Now for our selfe , and for this time of meeting Thus much the businesse is .
shakespeare#We haue heere writ To Norway , Vncle of young Fortinbras , Who Impotent and Bedrid , scarsely heares Of this his Nephewes purpose , to suppresse His further gate heerein . In that the Leuies , The Lists , and full proportions are all made Out of his subiect : and we heere dispatch You good Cornelius , and you Voltemand , For bearing of this greeting to old Norway , Giuing to you no further personall power To businesse with the King , more then the scope Of these dilated Articles allow : Farewell , and let your hast commend your duty Volt . In that , and all things , will we shew our duty King . We doubt it nothing , heartily farewell .

Dread my Lord , Your leaue and fauour to returne to France , From whence , though willingly I came to Denmarke To shew my duty in your Coronation , Yet now I must confesse , that duty done , My thoughts and wishes bend againe towards France , And bow them to your gracious leaue and pardon King . Haue you your Fathers leaue ?

shakespeare#Good Hamlet cast thy nightly colour off , And let thine eye looke like a Friend on Denmarke . Do not for euer with thy veyled lids Seeke for thy Noble Father in the dust ; Thou know ' st ' tis common , all that liues must dye , Passing through Nature , to Eternity Ham . I Madam , it is common Queen . If it be ; Why seemes it so particular with thee
shakespeare#Ham . Seemes Madam ? Nay , it is : I know not Seemes : ' Tis not alone my Inky Cloake ( good Mother ) Nor Customary suites of solemne Blacke , Nor windy suspiration of forc ' d breath , No , nor the fruitfull Riuer in the Eye , Nor the deiected hauiour of the Visage , Together with all Formes , Moods , shewes of Griefe , That can denote me truly . These indeed Seeme , For they are actions that a man might play : But I haue that Within , which passeth show ; These , but the Trappings , and the Suites of woe King . ' Tis sweet and commendable In your Nature Hamlet , To giue these mourning duties to your Father : But you must know , your Father lost a Father , That Father lost , lost his , and the Suruiuer bound In filiall Obligation , for some terme To do obsequious Sorrow .
shakespeare#But to perseuer In obstinate Condolement , is a course Of impious stubbornnesse . ' Tis vnmanly greefe , It shewes a will most incorrect to Heauen , A Heart vnfortified , a Minde impatient , An Vnderstanding simple , and vnschool ' d : For , what we know must be , and is as common As any the most vulgar thing to sence , Why should we in our peeuish Opposition Take it to heart ? Fye , ' tis a fault to Heauen , A fault against the Dead , a fault to Nature , To Reason most absurd , whose common Theame Is death of Fathers , and who still hath cried , From the first Coarse , till he that dyed to day , This must be so . We pray you throw to earth This vnpreuayling woe , and thinke of vs As of a Father ; For let the world take note , You are the most immediate to our Throne , And with no lesse Nobility of Loue , Then that which deerest Father beares his Sonne , Do I impart towards you .

shakespeare#A figure like your Father , Arm ' d at all points exactly , Cap a Pe , Appeares before them , and with sollemne march Goes slow and stately : By them thrice he walkt , By their opprest and feare - surprized eyes , Within his Truncheons length ; whilst they bestil ' d Almost to Ielly with the Act of feare , Stand dumbe and speake not to him . This to me In dreadfull secrecie impart they did , And I with them the third Night kept the Watch , Whereas they had deliuer ' d both in time , Forme of the thing ; each word made true and good , The Apparition comes . I knew your Father : These hands are not more like Ham . But where was this ? Mar .

Doe you doubt that ? Laer . For Hamlet , and the trifling of his fauours , Hold it a fashion and a toy in Bloude ; A Violet in the youth of Primy Nature ; Froward , not permanent ; sweet not lasting The suppliance of a minute ?
shakespeare#No more Ophel . No more but so Laer . Thinke it no more : For nature cressant does not grow alone , In thewes and Bulke : but as his Temple waxes , The inward seruice of the Minde and Soule Growes wide withall . Perhaps he loues you now , And now no soyle nor cautell doth besmerch The vertue of his feare : but you must feare His greatnesse weigh ' d , his will is not his owne ; For hee himselfe is subiect to his Birth : Hee may not , as vnuallued persons doe , Carue for himselfe ; for , on his choyce depends The sanctity and health of the whole State .
shakespeare#And therefore must his choyce be circumscrib ' d Vnto the voyce and yeelding of that Body , Whereof he is the Head . Then if he sayes he loues you , It fits your wisedome so farre to beleeue it ; As he in his peculiar Sect and force May giue his saying deed : which is no further , Then the maine voyce of Denmarke goes withall . Then weight what losse your Honour may sustaine , If with too credent eare you list his Songs ; Or lose your Heart ; or your chast Treasure open To his vnmastred importunity . Feare it Ophelia , feare it my deare Sister , And keepe within the reare of your Affection ; Out of the shot and danger of Desire . The chariest Maid is Prodigall enough , If she vnmaske her beauty to the Moone : Vertue it selfe scapes not calumnious stroakes , The Canker Galls , the Infants of the Spring Too oft before the buttons be disclos ' d , And in the Morne and liquid dew of Youth , Contagious blastments are most imminent . Be wary then , best safety lies in feare ; Youth to it selfe rebels , though none else neere
shakespeare#Ophe . I shall th ' effect of this good Lesson keepe , As watchmen to my heart : but good my Brother Doe not as some vngracious Pastors doe , Shew me the steepe and thorny way to Heauen ; Whilst like a puft and recklesse Libertine Himselfe , the Primrose path of dalliance treads , And reaks not his owne reade Laer . Oh , feare me not . Enter Polonius . I stay too long ; but here my Father comes : A double blessing is a double grace ; Occasion smiles vpon a second leaue
shakespeare#Polon . Yet heere Laertes ? Aboord , aboord for shame , The winde sits in the shoulder of your saile , And you are staid for there : my blessing with you ; And these few Precepts in thy memory , See thou Character . Giue thy thoughts no tongue , Nor any vnproportion ' d thoughts his Act : Be thou familiar ; but by no meanes vulgar : The friends thou hast , and their adoption tride , Grapple them to thy Soule , with hoopes of Steele : But doe not dull thy palme , with entertainment Of each vnhatch ' t , vnfledg ' d Comrade . Beware Of entrance to a quarrell : but being in Bear ' t that th ' opposed may beware of thee . Giue euery man thine eare ; but few thy voyce : Take each mans censure ; but reserue thy iudgement : Costly thy habit as thy purse can buy ; But not exprest in fancie ; rich , not gawdie : For the Apparell oft proclaimes the man .
shakespeare#And they in France of the best ranck and station , Are of a most select and generous cheff in that . Neither a borrower , nor a lender be ; For lone oft loses both it selfe and friend : And borrowing duls the edge of Husbandry . This aboue all ; to thine owne selfe be true : And it must follow , as the Night the Day , Thou canst not then be false to any man . Farewell : my Blessing season this in thee Laer . Most humbly doe I take my leaue , my Lord

shakespeare#Ophe . I do not know , my Lord , what I should thinke Polon . Marry Ile teach you ; thinke your selfe a Baby , That you haue tane his tenders for true pay , Which are not starling . Tender your selfe more dearly ; Or not to crack the winde of the poore Phrase , Roaming it thus , you ' l tender me a foole Ophe .
shakespeare#My Lord , he hath importun ' d me with loue , In honourable fashion Polon . I , fashion you may call it , go too , go too Ophe . And hath giuen countenance to his speech , My Lord , with all the vowes of Heauen Polon .
shakespeare#I , Springes to catch Woodcocks . I doe know When the Bloud burnes , how Prodigall the Soule Giues the tongue vowes : these blazes , Daughter , Giuing more light then heate ; extinct in both , Euen in their promise , as it is a making ; You must not take for fire . For this time Daughter , Be somewhat scanter of your Maiden presence ; Set your entreatments at a higher rate , Then a command to parley . For Lord Hamlet , Beleeue so much in him , that he is young , And with a larger tether may he walke , Then may be giuen you . In few , Ophelia , Doe not beleeue his vowes ; for they are Broakers , Not of the eye , which their Inuestments show : But meere implorators of vnholy Sutes , Breathing like sanctified and pious bonds , The better to beguile . This is for all : I would not , in plaine tearmes , from this time forth , Haue you so slander any moment leisure , As to giue words or talke with the Lord Hamlet : Looke too ' t , I charge you ; come your wayes

shakespeare#The King doth wake to night , and takes his rouse , Keepes wassels and the swaggering vpspring reeles , And as he dreines his draughts of Renish downe , The kettle Drum and Trumpet thus bray out The triumph of his Pledge Horat . Is it a custome ? Ham . I marry ist ; And to my mind , though I am natiue heere , And to the manner borne : It is a Custome More honour ' d in the breach , then the obseruance . Enter Ghost .
shakespeare#Hor . Looke my Lord , it comes Ham . Angels and Ministers of Grace defend vs : Be thou a Spirit of health , or Goblin damn ' d , Bring with thee ayres from Heauen , or blasts from Hell , Be thy euents wicked or charitable , Thou com ' st in such a questionable shape That I will speake to thee . Ile call thee Hamlet , King , Father , Royall Dane : Oh , oh , answer me , Let me not burst in Ignorance ; but tell Why thy Canoniz ' d bones Hearsed in death , Haue burst their cerments , why the Sepulcher Wherein we saw thee quietly enurn ' d , Hath op ' d his ponderous and Marble iawes , To cast thee vp againe ? What may this meane ?
shakespeare#That thou dead Coarse againe in compleat steele , Reuisits thus the glimpses of the Moone , Making Night hidious ? And we fooles of Nature , So horridly to shake our disposition , With thoughts beyond thee ; reaches of our Soules , Say , why is this ? wherefore ? what should we doe ? Ghost beckens Hamlet . Hor .

Or to the dreadfull Sonnet of the Cliffe , That beetles o ' re his base into the Sea , And there assumes some other horrible forme , Which might depriue your Soueraignty of Reason , And draw you into madnesse thinke of it ? Ham . It wafts me still : goe on , Ile follow thee
shakespeare#Mar . You shall not goe my Lord Ham . Hold off your hand Hor . Be rul ' d , you shall not goe
shakespeare#Ham . My fate cries out , And makes each petty Artire in this body , As hardy as the Nemian Lions nerue : Still am I cal ' d ? Vnhand me Gentlemen : By Heau ' n , Ile make a Ghost of him that lets me : I say away , goe on , Ile follow thee . Exeunt . Ghost & Hamlet . Hor .

shakespeare#Ham . What ? Gho . I am thy Fathers Spirit , Doom ' d for a certaine terme to walke the night ; And for the day confin ' d to fast in Fiers , Till the foule crimes done in my dayes of Nature Are burnt and purg ' d away ? But that I am forbid To tell the secrets of my Prison - House ; I could a Tale vnfold , whose lightest word Would harrow vp thy soule , freeze thy young blood , Make thy two eyes like Starres , start from their Spheres , Thy knotty and combined lockes to part , And each particular haire to stand an end , Like Quilles vpon the fretfull Porpentine : But this eternall blason must not be To eares of flesh and bloud ; list Hamlet , oh list , If thou didst euer thy deare Father loue Ham .

Hast , hast me to know it , That with wings as swift As meditation , or the thoughts of Loue , May sweepe to my Reuenge Ghost . I finde thee apt , And duller should ' st thou be then the fat weede That rots it selfe in ease , on Lethe Wharfe , Would ' st thou not stirre in this . Now Hamlet heare : It ' s giuen out , that sleeping in mine Orchard , A Serpent stung me : so the whole eare of Denmarke , Is by a forged processe of my death Rankly abus ' d : But know thou Noble youth , The Serpent that did sting thy Fathers life , Now weares his Crowne
shakespeare#Ham . O my Propheticke soule : mine Vncle ? Ghost . I that incestuous , that adulterate Beast With witchcraft of his wits , hath Traitorous guifts . Oh wicked Wit , and Gifts , that haue the power So to seduce ? Won to this shamefull Lust The will of my most seeming vertuous Queene : Oh Hamlet , what a falling off was there , From me , whose loue was of that dignity , That it went hand in hand , euen with the Vow I made to her in Marriage ; and to decline Vpon a wretch , whose Naturall gifts were poore To those of mine .
shakespeare#But Vertue , as it neuer wil be moued , Though Lewdnesse court it in a shape of Heauen : So Lust , though to a radiant Angell link ' d , Will sate it selfe in a Celestiall bed , & prey on Garbage . But soft , me thinkes I sent the Mornings Ayre ; Briefe let me be : Sleeping within mine Orchard , My custome alwayes in the afternoone ; Vpon my secure hower thy Vncle stole With iuyce of cursed Hebenon in a Violl , And in the Porches of mine eares did poure The leaperous Distilment ; whose effect Holds such an enmity with bloud of Man , That swift as Quick - siluer , it courses through The naturall Gates and Allies of the body ; And with a sodaine vigour it doth posset And curd , like Aygre droppings into Milke , The thin and wholsome blood : so did it mine ; And a most instant Tetter bak ' d about , Most Lazar - like , with vile and loathsome crust , All my smooth Body . Thus was I , sleeping , by a Brothers hand , Of Life , of Crowne , and Queene at once dispatcht ; Cut off euen in the Blossomes of my Sinne , Vnhouzzled , disappointed , vnnaneld , No reckoning made , but sent to my account With all my imperfections on my head ; Oh horrible Oh horrible , most horrible : If thou hast nature in thee beare it not ; Let not the Royall Bed of Denmarke be A Couch for Luxury and damned Incest . But howsoeuer thou pursuest this Act , Taint not thy mind ; nor let thy Soule contriue Against thy Mother ought ; leaue her to heauen , And to those Thornes that in her bosome lodge , To pricke and sting her . Fare thee well at once ; The Glow - worme showes the Matine to be neere , And gins to pale his vneffectuall Fire : Adue , adue , Hamlet : remember me . Enter .

Oh fie : hold my heart ; And you my sinnewes , grow not instant Old ; But beare me stiffely vp : Remember thee ?

shakespeare#Yea , from the Table of my Memory , Ile wipe away all triuiall fond Records , All sawes of Bookes , all formes , all presures past , That youth and obseruation coppied there ; And thy Commandment all alone shall liue Within the Booke and Volume of my Braine , Vnmixt with baser matter ; yes yes , by Heauen : Oh most pernicious woman ! Oh Villaine , Villaine , smiling damned Villaine ! My Tables , my Tables ; meet it is I set it downe , That one may smile , and smile and be a Villaine ; At least I ' m sure it may be so in Denmarke ; So Vnckle there you are : now to my word ; It is ; Adue , Adue , Remember me : I haue sworn ' t Hor . & Mar . within .

Looke you Sir , Enquire me first what Danskers are in Paris ; And how , and who ; what meanes ; and where they keepe : What company , at what expence : and finding By this encompassement and drift of question , That they doe know my sonne : Come you more neerer Then your particular demands will touch it , Take you as ' twere some distant knowledge of him , And thus I know his father and his friends , And in part him . Doe you marke this Reynoldo ? Reynol .
shakespeare#I , very well my Lord Polon . And in part him , but you may say not well ; But if ' t be hee I meane , hees very wilde ; Addicted so and so ; and there put on him What forgeries you please ; marry , none so ranke , As may dishonour him ; take heed of that : But Sir , such wanton , wild , and vsuall slips , As are Companions noted and most knowne To youth and liberty Reynol . As gaming my Lord Polon .
shakespeare#I , or drinking , fencing , swearing , Quarelling , drabbing . You may goe so farre Reynol . My Lord that would dishonour him Polon . Faith no , as you may season it in the charge ; You must not put another scandall on him , That hee is open to Incontinencie ; That ' s not my meaning : but breath his faults so quaintly , That they may seeme the taints of liberty ; The flash and out - breake of a fiery minde , A sauagenes in vnreclaim ' d bloud of generall assault
shakespeare#Reynol . But my good Lord Polon . Wherefore should you doe this ? Reynol . I my Lord , I would know that
shakespeare#Polon . Marry Sir , heere ' s my drift , And I belieue it is a fetch of warrant : You laying these slight sulleyes on my Sonne , As ' twere a thing a little soil ' d i ' th ' working : Marke you your party in conuerse ; him you would sound , Hauing euer seene . In the prenominate crimes , The youth you breath of guilty , be assur ' d He closes with you in this consequence : Good sir , or so , or friend , or Gentleman . According to the Phrase and the Addition , Of man and Country Reynol . Very good my Lord

shakespeare#Polon . At closes in the consequence , I marry , He closes with you thus . I know the Gentleman , I saw him yesterday , or tother day ; Or then or then , with such and such ; and as you say , There was he gaming , there o ' retooke in ' s Rouse , There falling out at Tennis ; or perchance , I saw him enter such a house of saile ; Videlicet , a Brothell , or so forth . See you now ; Your bait of falshood , takes this Cape of truth ; And thus doe we of wisedome and of reach With windlesses , and with assaies of Bias , By indirections finde directions out : So by my former Lecture and aduice Shall you my Sonne ; you haue me , haue you not ? Reynol . My Lord I haue

shakespeare#Polon . With what , in the name of Heauen ? Ophe . My Lord , as I was sowing in my Chamber , Lord Hamlet with his doublet all vnbrac ' d , No hat vpon his head , his stockings foul ' d , Vngartred , and downe giued to his Anckle , Pale as his shirt , his knees knocking each other , And with a looke so pitious in purport , As if he had been loosed out of hell , To speake of horrors : he comes before me Polon . Mad for thy Loue ?
shakespeare#Ophe . My Lord , I doe not know : but truly I do feare it Polon . What said he ? Ophe . He tooke me by the wrist , and held me hard ; Then goes he to the length of all his arme ; And with his other hand thus o ' re his brow , He fals to such perusall of my face , As he would draw it .
shakespeare#Long staid he so , At last , a little shaking of mine Arme : And thrice his head thus wauing vp and downe ; He rais ' d a sigh , so pittious and profound , That it did seeme to shatter all his bulke , And end his being . That done , he lets me goe , And with his head ouer his shoulders turn ' d , He seem ' d to finde his way without his eyes , For out adores he went without their helpe ; And to the last , bended their light on me Polon . Goe with me , I will goe seeke the King , This is the very extasie of Loue , Whose violent property foredoes it selfe , And leads the will to desperate Vndertakings , As oft as any passion vnder Heauen , That does afflict our Natures . I am sorrie , What haue you giuen him any hard words of late ? Ophe .
shakespeare#No my good Lord : but as you did command , I did repell his Letters , and deny ' de His accesse to me Pol . That hath made him mad . I am sorrie that with better speed and iudgement I had not quoted him . I feare he did but trifle , And meant to wracke thee : but beshrew my iealousie : It seemes it is as proper to our Age , To cast beyond our selues in our Opinions , As it is common for the yonger sort To lacke discretion . Come , go we to the King , This must be knowne , being kept close might moue More greefe to hide , then hate to vtter loue .

What it should bee More then his Fathers death , that thus hath put him So much from th ' vnderstanding of himselfe , I cannot deeme of . I intreat you both , That being of so young dayes brought vp with him : And since so Neighbour ' d to his youth , and humour , That you vouchsafe your rest heere in our Court Some little time : so by your Companies To draw him on to pleasures , and to gather So much as from Occasions you may gleane , That open ' d lies within our remedie Qu . Good Gentlemen , he hath much talk ' d of you , And sure I am , two men there are not liuing , To whom he more adheres . If it will please you To shew vs so much Gentrie , and good will , As to expend your time with vs a - while , For the supply and profit of our Hope , Your Visitation shall receiue such thankes As fits a Kings remembrance

shakespeare#Volt . Most faire returne of Greetings , and Desires . Vpon our first , he sent out to suppresse His Nephewes Leuies , which to him appear ' d To be a preparation ' gainst the Poleak : But better look ' d into , he truly found It was against your Highnesse , whereat greeued , That so his Sicknesse , Age , and Impotence Was falsely borne in hand , sends out Arrests On Fortinbras , which he ( in breefe ) obeyes , Receiues rebuke from Norwey : and in fine , Makes Vow before his Vnkle , neuer more To giue th ' assay of Armes against your Maiestie . Whereon old Norwey , ouercome with ioy , Giues him three thousand Crownes in Annuall Fee , And his Commission to imploy those Soldiers So leuied as before , against the Poleak : With an intreaty heerein further shewne , That it might please you to giue quiet passe Through your Dominions , for his Enterprize , On such regards of safety and allowance , As therein are set downe King .

shakespeare#My Liege , and Madam , to expostulate What Maiestie should be , what Dutie is , Why day is day ; night , night ; and time is time , Were nothing but to waste Night , Day , and Time . Therefore , since Breuitie is the Soule of Wit , And tediousnesse , the limbes and outward flourishes , I will be breefe . Your Noble Sonne is mad : Mad call I it ; for to define true Madnesse , What is ' t , but to be nothing else but mad . But let that go Qu . More matter , with lesse Art
shakespeare#Pol . Madam , I sweare I vse no Art at all : That he is mad , ' tis true : ' Tis true ' tis pittie , And pittie it is true : A foolish figure , But farewell it : for I will vse no Art . Mad let vs grant him then : and now remaines That we finde out the cause of this effect , Or rather say , the cause of this defect ; For this effect defectiue , comes by cause , Thus it remaines , and the remainder thus . Perpend , I haue a daughter : haue , whil ' st she is mine , Who in her Dutie and Obedience , marke , Hath giuen me this : now gather , and surmise . The Letter . To the Celestiall , and my Soules Idoll , the most beautifed Ophelia .
shakespeare#That ' s an ill Phrase , a vilde Phrase , beautified is a vilde Phrase : but you shall heare these in her excellent white bosome , these Qu . Came this from Hamlet to her Pol . Good Madam stay awhile , I will be faithfull . Doubt thou , the Starres are fire , Doubt , that the Sunne doth moue : Doubt Truth to be a Lier , But neuer Doubt , I loue .

Thine euermore most deere Lady , whilst this Machine is to him , Hamlet . This in Obedience hath my daughter shew ' d me : And more aboue hath his soliciting , As they fell out by Time , by Meanes , and Place , All giuen to mine eare King . But how hath she receiu ' d his Loue ?
shakespeare#Pol . What do you thinke of me ? King . As of a man , faithfull and Honourable Pol . I wold faine proue so .
shakespeare#But what might you think ? When I had seene this hot loue on the wing , As I perceiued it , I must tell you that Before my Daughter told me what might you Or my deere Maiestie your Queene heere , think , If I had playd the Deske or Table - booke , Or giuen my heart a winking , mute and dumbe , Or look ' d vpon this Loue , with idle sight , What might you thinke ? No , I went round to worke , And ( my yong Mistris ) thus I did bespeake Lord Hamlet is a Prince out of thy Starre , This must not be : and then , I Precepts gaue her , That she should locke her selfe from his Resort , Admit no Messengers , receiue no Tokens : Which done , she tooke the Fruites of my Aduice , And he repulsed . A short Tale to make , Fell into a Sadnesse , then into a Fast , Thence to a Watch , thence into a Weaknesse , Thence to a Lightnesse , and by this declension Into the Madnesse whereon now he raues , And all we waile for King . Do you thinke ' tis this ?
shakespeare#Qu . It may be very likely Pol . Hath there bene such a time , I ' de fain know that , That I haue possitiuely said , ' tis so , When it prou ' d otherwise ? King . Not that I know
shakespeare#Pol . Take this from this ; if this be otherwise , If Circumstances leade me , I will finde Where truth is hid , though it were hid indeede Within the Center King . How may we try it further ? Pol . You know sometimes He walkes foure houres together , heere In the Lobby
shakespeare#Qu . So he ha ' s indeed Pol . At such a time Ile loose my Daughter to him , Be you and I behinde an Arras then , Marke the encounter : If he loue her not , And be not from his reason falne thereon ; Let me be no Assistant for a State , And keepe a Farme and Carters King . We will try it .

shakespeare#Pol . Honest , my Lord ? Ham . I sir , to be honest as this world goes , is to bee one man pick ' d out of two thousand Pol . That ' s very true , my Lord
shakespeare#Ham . For if the Sun breed Magots in a dead dogge , being a good kissing Carrion - Haue you a daughter ? Pol . I haue my Lord Ham . Let her not walke i ' thSunne : Conception is a blessing , but not as your daughter may conceiue .
shakespeare#Friend looke too ' t Pol . How say you by that ? Still harping on my daughter : yet he knew me not at first ; he said I was a Fishmonger : he is farre gone , farre gone : and truly in my youth , I suffred much extreamity for loue : very neere this . Ile speake to him againe . What do you read my Lord ?
shakespeare#Ham . Words , words , words Pol . What is the matter , my Lord ? Ham . Betweene who ?
shakespeare#Pol . I meane the matter you meane , my Lord Ham . Slanders Sir : for the Satyricall slaue saies here , that old men haue gray Beards ; that their faces are wrinkled ; their eyes purging thicke Amber , or Plum - Tree Gumme : and that they haue a plentifull locke of Wit , together with weake Hammes . All which Sir , though I most powerfully , and potently beleeue ; yet I holde it not Honestie to haue it thus set downe : For you your selfe Sir , should be old as I am , if like a Crab you could go backward Pol .
shakespeare#Though this be madnesse , Yet there is Method in ' t : will you walke Out of the ayre my Lord ? Ham . Into my Graue ? Pol . Indeed that is out o ' th ' Ayre : How pregnant ( sometimes ) his Replies are ? A happinesse , That often Madnesse hits on , Which Reason and Sanitie could not So prosperously be deliuer ' d of .

You cannot Sir take from me any thing , that I will more willingly part withall , except my life , my life Polon . Fare you well my Lord
shakespeare#Ham . These tedious old fooles Polon . You goe to seeke my Lord Hamlet ; there hee is . Enter Rosincran and Guildensterne . Rosin .

shakespeare#My excellent good friends ? How do ' st thou Guildensterne ? Oh , Rosincrane ; good Lads : How doe ye both ? Rosin . As the indifferent Children of the earth Guild .
shakespeare#Happy , in that we are not ouer - happy : on Fortunes Cap , we are not the very Button Ham . Nor the Soales of her Shoo ? Rosin . Neither my Lord Ham .
shakespeare#Then you liue about her waste , or in the middle of her fauour ? Guil . Faith , her priuates , we Ham . In the secret parts of Fortune ? Oh , most true : she is a Strumpet .
shakespeare#What ' s the newes ? Rosin . None my Lord ; but that the World ' s growne honest Ham . Then is Doomesday neere : But your newes is not true . Let me question more in particular : what haue you my good friends , deserued at the hands of Fortune , that she sends you to Prison hither ?
shakespeare#Guil . Prison , my Lord ? Ham . Denmark ' s a Prison Rosin . Then is the World one
shakespeare#Ham . A goodly one , in which there are many Confines , Wards , and Dungeons ; Denmarke being one o ' th ' worst Rosin . We thinke not so my Lord Ham . Why then ' tis none to you ; for there is nothing either good or bad , but thinking makes it so : to me it is a prison
shakespeare#Rosin . Why then your Ambition makes it one : ' tis too narrow for your minde Ham . O God , I could be bounded in a nutshell , and count my selfe a King of infinite space ; were it not that I haue bad dreames Guil . Which dreames indeed are Ambition : for the very substance of the Ambitious , is meerely the shadow of a Dreame
shakespeare#Ham . A dreame it selfe is but a shadow Rosin . Truely , and I hold Ambition of so ayry and light a quality , that it is but a shadowes shadow Ham . Then are our Beggers bodies ; and our Monarchs and out - stretcht Heroes the Beggers Shadowes : shall wee to th ' Court : for , by my fey I cannot reason ?
shakespeare#Both . Wee ' l wait vpon you Ham . No such matter . I will not sort you with the rest of my seruants : for to speake to you like an honest man : I am most dreadfully attended ; but in the beaten way of friendship , What make you at Elsonower ? Rosin .
shakespeare#To visit you my Lord , no other occasion Ham . Begger that I am , I am euen poore in thankes ; but I thanke you : and sure deare friends my thanks are too deare a halfepeny ; were you not sent for ? Is it your owne inclining ? Is it a free visitation ? Come , deale iustly with me : come , come ; nay speake
shakespeare#Guil . What should we say my Lord ? Ham . Why any thing . But to the purpose ; you were sent for ; and there is a kinde confession in your lookes ; which your modesties haue not craft enough to color , I know the good King & Queene haue sent for you Rosin .
shakespeare#To what end my Lord ? Ham . That you must teach me : but let mee coniure you by the rights of our fellowship , by the consonancy of our youth , by the Obligation of our euer - preserued loue , and by what more deare , a better proposer could charge you withall ; be euen and direct with me , whether you were sent for or no Rosin . What say you ? Ham .
shakespeare#Nay then I haue an eye of you : if you loue me hold not off Guil . My Lord , we were sent for Ham . I will tell you why ; so shall my anticipation preuent your discouery of your secricie to the King and Queene : moult no feather , I haue of late , but wherefore I know not , lost all my mirth , forgone all custome of exercise ; and indeed , it goes so heauenly with my disposition ; that this goodly frame the Earth , seemes to me a sterrill Promontory ; this most excellent Canopy the Ayre , look you , this braue ore - hanging , this Maiesticall Roofe , fretted with golden fire : why , it appeares no other thing to mee , then a foule and pestilent congregation of vapours . What a piece of worke is a man !
shakespeare#how Noble in Reason ? how infinite in faculty ? in forme and mouing how expresse and admirable ? in Action , how like an Angel ? in apprehension , how like a God ? the beauty of the world , the Parragon of Animals ; and yet to me , what is this Quintessence of Dust ?
shakespeare#Man delights not me ; no , nor Woman neither ; though by your smiling you seeme to say so Rosin . My Lord , there was no such stuffe in my thoughts Ham . Why did you laugh , when I said , Man delights not me ? Rosin .
shakespeare#To thinke , my Lord , if you delight not in Man , what Lenton entertainment the Players shall receiue from you : wee coated them on the way , and hither are they comming to offer you Seruice Ham . He that playes the King shall be welcome ; his Maiesty shall haue Tribute of mee : the aduenturous Knight shal vse his Foyle and Target : the Louer shall not sigh gratis , the humorous man shall end his part in peace : the Clowne shall make those laugh whose lungs are tickled a ' th ' sere : and the Lady shall say her minde freely ; or the blanke Verse shall halt for ' t : what Players are they ? Rosin . Euen those you were wont to take delight in the Tragedians of the City Ham .
shakespeare#How chances it they trauaile ? their residence both in reputation and profit was better both wayes Rosin . I thinke their Inhibition comes by the meanes of the late Innouation ? Ham . Doe they hold the same estimation they did when I was in the City ?
shakespeare#Are they so follow ' d ? Rosin . No indeed , they are not Ham . How comes it ? doe they grow rusty ?
shakespeare#Rosin . Nay , their indeauour keepes in the wonted pace ; But there is Sir an ayrie of Children , little Yases , that crye out on the top of question ; and are most tyrannically clap ' t for ' t : these are now the fashion , and so be - ratled the common Stages ( so they call them ) that many wearing Rapiers , are affraide of Goose - quils , and dare scarse come thither Ham . What are they Children ? Who maintains ' em ? How are they escorted ?
shakespeare#Will they pursue the Quality no longer then they can sing ? Will they not say afterwards if they should grow themselues to common Players ( as it is most like if their meanes are not better ) their Writers do them wrong , to make them exclaim against their owne Succession Rosin . Faith there ha ' s bene much to do on both sides : and the Nation holds it no sinne , to tarre them to Controuersie . There was for a while , no mony bid for argument , vnlesse the Poet and the Player went to Cuffes in the Question Ham .
shakespeare#Is ' t possible ? Guild . Oh there ha ' s beene much throwing about of Braines Ham . Do the Boyes carry it away ? Rosin .
shakespeare#I that they do my Lord . Hercules & his load too Ham . It is not strange : for mine Vnckle is King of Denmarke , and those that would make mowes at him while my Father liued ; giue twenty , forty , an hundred Ducates a peece , for his picture in Little . There is something in this more then Naturall , if Philosophie could finde it out . Flourish for the Players .
shakespeare#Guil . There are the Players Ham . Gentlemen , you are welcom to Elsonower : your hands , come : The appurtenance of Welcome , is Fashion and Ceremony . Let me comply with you in the Garbe , lest my extent to the Players ( which I tell you must shew fairely outward ) should more appeare like entertainment then yours . You are welcome : but my Vnckle Father , and Aunt Mother are deceiu ' d
shakespeare#Guil . In what my deere Lord ? Ham . I am but mad North , North - West : when the Winde is Southerly , I know a Hawke from a Handsaw . Enter Polonius . Pol .
shakespeare#Well be with you Gentlemen Ham . Hearke you Guildensterne , and you too : at each eare a hearer : that great Baby you see there , is not yet out of his swathing clouts Rosin . Happily he ' s the second time come to them : for they say , an old man is twice a childe Ham .
shakespeare#I will Prophesie . Hee comes to tell me of the Players . Mark it , you say right Sir : for a Monday morning ' twas so indeed Pol . My Lord , I haue Newes to tell you Ham .
shakespeare#My Lord , I haue Newes to tell you . When Rossius an Actor in Rome - Pol . The Actors are come hither my Lord Ham . Buzze , buzze Pol .
shakespeare#Vpon mine Honor Ham . Then can each Actor on his Asse - Polon . The best Actors in the world , either for Tragedie , Comedie , Historie , Pastorall : Pastoricall - Comicall - Historicall - Pastorall : Tragicall - Historicall : Tragicall - Comicall - Historicall - Pastorall : Scene indiuidible : or Poem vnlimited . Seneca cannot be too heauy , nor Plautus too light , for the law of Writ , and the Liberty . These are the onely men
shakespeare#Ham . O Iephta Iudge of Israel , what a Treasure had ' st thou ? Pol . What a Treasure had he , my Lord ? Ham . Why one faire Daughter , and no more , The which he loued passing well
shakespeare#Pol . Still on my Daughter Ham . Am I not i ' th ' right old Iephta ? Polon . If you call me Iephta my Lord , I haue a daughter that I loue passing well
shakespeare#Ham . Nay that followes not Polon . What followes then , my Lord ? Ha . Why , As by lot , God wot : and then you know , It came to passe , as most like it was : The first rowe of the Pons Chanson will shew you more .
shakespeare#For looke where my Abridgements come . Enter foure or fiue Players . Y ' are welcome Masters , welcome all . I am glad to see thee well : Welcome good Friends . Oh my olde Friend ? Thy face is valiant since I saw thee last : Com ' st thou to beard me in Denmarke ?
shakespeare#What , my yong Lady and Mistris ? Byrlady your Ladiship is neerer Heauen then when I saw you last , by the altitude of a Choppine . Pray God your voice like a peece of vncurrant Gold be not crack ' d within the ring . Masters , you are all welcome : wee ' l e ' ne to ' t like French Faulconers , flie at any thing we see : wee ' l haue a Speech straight . Come giue vs a tast of your quality : come , a passionate speech 1 . Play .
shakespeare#What speech , my Lord ? Ham . I heard thee speak me a speech once , but it was neuer Acted : or if it was , not aboue once , for the Play I remember pleas ' d not the Million , ' twas Cauiarie to the Generall : but it was ( as I receiu ' d it , and others , whose iudgement in such matters , cried in the top of mine ) an excellent Play ; well digested in the Scoenes , set downe with as much modestie , as cunning . I remember one said , there was no Sallets in the lines , to make the matter sauory ; nor no matter in the phrase , that might indite the Author of affectation , but cal ' d it an honest method . One cheefe Speech in it , I cheefely lou ' d , ' twas Aeneas Tale to Dido , and thereabout of it especially , where he speaks of Priams slaughter . If it liue in your memory , begin at this Line , let me see , let me see : The rugged Pyrrhus like th ' Hyrcanian Beast .
shakespeare#It is not so : it begins with Pyrrhus The rugged Pyrrhus , he whose Sable Armes Blacke as his purpose , did the night resemble When he lay couched in the Ominous Horse , Hath now this dread and blacke Complexion smear ' d With Heraldry more dismall : Head to foote Now is he to take Geulles , horridly Trick ' d With blood of Fathers , Mothers , Daughters , Sonnes , Bak ' d and impasted with the parching streets , That lend a tyrannous , and damned light To their vilde Murthers , roasted in wrath and fire , And thus o ' re - sized with coagulate gore , With eyes like Carbuncles , the hellish Pyrrhus Olde Grandsire Priam seekes Pol . Fore God , my Lord , well spoken , with good accent , and good discretion 1 . Player . Anon he findes him , Striking too short at Greekes . His anticke Sword , Rebellious to his Arme , lyes where it falles Repugnant to command : vnequall match , Pyrrhus at Priam driues , in Rage strikes wide : But with the whiffe and winde of his fell Sword , Th ' vnnerued Father fals .
shakespeare#Then senselesse Illium , Seeming to feele his blow , with flaming top Stoopes to his Bace , and with a hideous crash Takes Prisoner Pyrrhus eare . For loe , his Sword Which was declining on the Milkie head Of Reuerend Priam , seem ' d i ' th ' Ayre to sticke : So as a painted Tyrant Pyrrhus stood , And like a Newtrall to his will and matter , did nothing . But as we often see against some storme , A silence in the Heauens , the Racke stand still , The bold windes speechlesse , and the Orbe below As hush as death : Anon the dreadfull Thunder Doth rend the Region . So after Pyrrhus pause , A rowsed Vengeance sets him new a - worke , And neuer did the Cyclops hammers fall On Mars his Armours , forg ' d for proofe Eterne , With lesse remorse then Pyrrhus bleeding sword Now falles on Priam . Out , out , thou Strumpet - Fortune , all you Gods , In generall Synod take away her power : Breake all the Spokes and Fallies from her wheele , And boule the round Naue downe the hill of Heauen , As low as to the Fiends Pol .
shakespeare#This is too long Ham . It shall to ' th Barbars , with your beard . Prythee say on : He ' s for a Iigge , or a tale of Baudry , or hee sleepes . Say on ; come to Hecuba 1 . Play .
shakespeare#But who , O who , had seen the inobled Queen Ham . The inobled Queene ? Pol . That ' s good : Inobled Queene is good 1 . Play .
shakespeare#Run bare - foot vp and downe , Threatning the flame With Bisson Rheume : A clout about that head , Where late the Diadem stood , and for a Robe About her lanke and all ore - teamed Loines , A blanket in th ' Alarum of feare caught vp . Who this had seene , with tongue in Venome steep ' d , ' Gainst Fortunes State , would Treason haue pronounc ' d ? But if the Gods themselues did see her then , When she saw Pyrrhus make malicious sport In mincing with his Sword her Husbands limbes , The instant Burst of Clamour that she made ( Vnlesse things mortall moue them not at all ) Would haue made milche the Burning eyes of Heauen , And passion in the Gods Pol . Looke where he ha ' s not turn ' d his colour , and ha ' s teares in ' s eyes . Pray you no more
shakespeare#Ham . ' Tis well , Ile haue thee speake out the rest , soone . Good my Lord , will you see the Players wel bestow ' d . Do ye heare , let them be well vs ' d : for they are the Abstracts and breefe Chronicles of the time . After your death , you were better haue a bad Epitaph , then their ill report while you liued Pol .
shakespeare#My Lord , I will vse them according to their desart Ham . Gods bodykins man , better . Vse euerie man after his desart , and who should scape whipping : vse them after your own Honor and Dignity . The lesse they deserue , the more merit is in your bountie . Take them in
shakespeare#Pol . Come sirs . Exit Polon . Ham . Follow him Friends : wee ' l heare a play to morrow . Dost thou heare me old Friend , can you play the murther of Gonzago ?
shakespeare#Play . I my Lord Ham . Wee ' l ha ' t to morrow night . You could for a need study a speech of some dosen or sixteene lines , which I would set downe , and insert in ' t ? Could ye not ?
shakespeare#Play . I my Lord Ham . Very well . Follow that Lord , and looke you mock him not . My good Friends , Ile leaue you til night you are welcome to Elsonower ?
shakespeare#Rosin . Good my Lord . Exeunt . Manet Hamlet . Ham . I so , God buy ' ye : Now I am alone .
shakespeare#Oh what a Rogue and Pesant slaue am I ? Is it not monstrous that this Player heere , But in a Fixion , in a dreame of Passion , Could force his soule so to his whole conceit , That from her working , all his visage warm ' d ; Teares in his eyes , distraction in ' s Aspect , A broken voyce , and his whole Function suiting With Formes , to his Conceit ? And all for nothing ? For Hecuba ? What ' s Hecuba to him , or he to Hecuba , That he should weepe for her ? What would he doe , Had he the Motiue and the Cue for passion That I haue ?
shakespeare#He would drowne the Stage with teares , And cleaue the generall eare with horrid speech : Make mad the guilty , and apale the free , Confound the ignorant , and amaze indeed , The very faculty of Eyes and Eares . Yet I , A dull and muddy - metled Rascall , peake Like Iohn a - dreames , vnpregnant of my cause , And can say nothing : No , not for a King , Vpon whose property , and most deere life , A damn ' d defeate was made . Am I a Coward ? Who calles me Villaine ? breakes my pate a - crosse ? Pluckes off my Beard , and blowes it in my face ?
shakespeare#Tweakes me by ' th ' Nose ? giues me the Lye i ' th ' Throate , As deepe as to the Lungs ? Who does me this ? Ha ? Why I should take it : for it cannot be , But I am Pigeon - Liuer ' d , and lacke Gall To make Oppression bitter , or ere this , I should haue fatted all the Region Kites With this Slaues Offall , bloudy : a Bawdy villaine , Remorselesse , Treacherous , Letcherous , kindles villaine ! Oh Vengeance !
shakespeare#Who ? What an Asse am I ? I sure , this is most braue , That I , the Sonne of the Deere murthered , Prompted to my Reuenge by Heauen , and Hell , Must ( like a Whore ) vnpacke my heart with words , And fall a Cursing like a very Drab . A Scullion ? Fye vpon ' t : Foh . About my Braine .
shakespeare#I haue heard , that guilty Creatures sitting at a Play , Haue by the very cunning of the Scoene , Bene strooke so to the soule , that presently They haue proclaim ' d their Malefactions . For Murther , though it haue no tongue , will speake With most myraculous Organ . Ile haue these Players , Play something like the murder of my Father , Before mine Vnkle . Ile obserue his lookes , Ile rent him to the quicke : If he but blench I know my course . The Spirit that I haue seene May be the Diuell , and the Diuel hath power T ' assume a pleasing shape , yea and perhaps Out of my Weaknesse , and my Melancholly , As he is very potent with such Spirits , Abuses me to damne me . Ile haue grounds More Relatiue then this : The Play ' s the thing , Wherein Ile catch the Conscience of the King .
shakespeare#Exit Enter King , Queene , Polonius , Ophelia , Rosincrance , Guildenstern , and Lords . King . And can you by no drift of circumstance Get from him why he puts on this Confusion : Grating so harshly all his dayes of quiet With turbulent and dangerous Lunacy Rosin . He does confesse he feeles himselfe distracted , But from what cause he will by no meanes speake
shakespeare#Guil . Nor do we finde him forward to be sounded , But with a crafty Madnesse keepes aloofe : When we would bring him on to some Confession Of his true state Qu . Did he receiue you well ? Rosin . Most like a Gentleman
shakespeare#Guild . But with much forcing of his disposition Rosin . Niggard of question , but of our demands Most free in his reply Qu . Did you assay him to any pastime ?
shakespeare#Rosin . Madam , it so fell out , that certaine Players We ore - wrought on the way : of these we told him , And there did seeme in him a kinde of ioy To heare of it : They are about the Court , And ( as I thinke ) they haue already order This night to play before him Pol . ' Tis most true : And he beseech ' d me to intreate your Maiesties To heare , and see the matter King . With all my heart , and it doth much content me To heare him so inclin ' d .
shakespeare#Good Gentlemen , Giue him a further edge , and driue his purpose on To these delights Rosin . We shall my Lord . Exeunt . King . Sweet Gertrude leaue vs too , For we haue closely sent for Hamlet hither , That he , as ' twere by accident , may there Affront Ophelia .
shakespeare#Her Father , and my selfe ( lawful espials ) Will so bestow our selues , that seeing vnseene We may of their encounter frankely iudge , And gather by him , as he is behaued , If ' t be th ' affliction of his loue , or no . That thus he suffers for Qu . I shall obey you , And for your part Ophelia , I do wish That your good Beauties be the happy cause Of Hamlets wildenesse : so shall I hope your Vertues Will bring him to his wonted way againe , To both your Honors Ophe . Madam , I wish it may
shakespeare#Pol . Ophelia , walke you heere . Gracious so please ye We will bestow our selues : Reade on this booke , That shew of such an exercise may colour Your lonelinesse . We are oft too blame in this , ' Tis too much prou ' d , that with Deuotions visage , And pious Action , we do surge o ' re The diuell himselfe King . Oh ' tis true : How smart a lash that speech doth giue my Conscience ?
shakespeare#The Harlots Cheeke beautied with plaist ' ring Art Is not more vgly to the thing that helpes it , Then is my deede , to my most painted word . Oh heauie burthen ! Pol . I heare him comming , let ' s withdraw my Lord . Exeunt . Enter Hamlet .
shakespeare#Ham . To be , or not to be , that is the Question : Whether ' tis Nobler in the minde to suffer The Slings and Arrowes of outragious Fortune , Or to take Armes against a Sea of troubles , And by opposing end them : to dye , to sleepe No more ; and by a sleepe , to say we end The Heart - ake , and the thousand Naturall shockes That Flesh is heyre too ? ' Tis a consummation Deuoutly to be wish ' d . To dye to sleepe , To sleepe , perchance to Dreame ; I , there ' s the rub , For in that sleepe of death , what dreames may come , When we haue shuffel ' d off this mortall coile , Must giue vs pawse . There ' s the respect That makes Calamity of so long life : For who would beare the Whips and Scornes of time , The Oppressors wrong , the poore mans Contumely , The pangs of dispriz ' d Loue , the Lawes delay , The insolence of Office , and the Spurnes That patient merit of the vnworthy takes , When he himselfe might his Quietus make With a bare Bodkin ? Who would these Fardles beare To grunt and sweat vnder a weary life , But that the dread of something after death , The vndiscouered Countrey , from whose Borne No Traueller returnes , Puzels the will , And makes vs rather beare those illes we haue , Then flye to others that we know not of .
shakespeare#Thus Conscience does make Cowards of vs all , And thus the Natiue hew of Resolution Is sicklied o ' re , with the pale cast of Thought , And enterprizes of great pith and moment , With this regard their Currants turne away , And loose the name of Action . Soft you now , The faire Ophelia ? Nimph , in thy Orizons Be all my sinnes remembred Ophe . Good my Lord , How does your Honor for this many a day ? Ham .
shakespeare#I humbly thanke you : well , well , well Ophe . My Lord , I haue Remembrances of yours , That I haue longed long to re - deliuer . I pray you now , receiue them Ham . No , no , I neuer gaue you ought
shakespeare#Ophe . My honor ' d Lord , I know right well you did , And with them words of so sweet breath compos ' d , As made the things more rich , then perfume left : Take these againe , for to the Noble minde Rich gifts wax poore , when giuers proue vnkinde . There my Lord Ham . Ha , ha : Are you honest ? Ophe .
shakespeare#My Lord Ham . Are you faire ? Ophe . What meanes your Lordship ? Ham .
shakespeare#That if you be honest and faire , your Honesty should admit no discourse to your Beautie Ophe . Could Beautie my Lord , haue better Comerce then your Honestie ? Ham . I trulie : for the power of Beautie , will sooner transforme Honestie from what is , to a Bawd , then the force of Honestie can translate Beautie into his likenesse . This was sometime a Paradox , but now the time giues it proofe .
shakespeare#I did loue you once Ophe . Indeed my Lord , you made me beleeue so Ham . You should not haue beleeued me . For vertue cannot so innocculate our old stocke , but we shall rellish of it .
shakespeare#I loued you not Ophe . I was the more deceiued Ham . Get thee to a Nunnerie . Why would ' st thou be a breeder of Sinners ?
shakespeare#I am my selfe indifferent honest , but yet I could accuse me of such things , that it were better my Mother had not borne me . I am very prowd , reuengefull , Ambitious , with more offences at my becke , then I haue thoughts to put them in imagination , to giue them shape , or time to acte them in . What should such Fellowes as I do , crawling betweene Heauen and Earth . We are arrant Knaues all , beleeue none of vs . Goe thy wayes to a Nunnery . Where ' s your Father ? Ophe .
shakespeare#At home , my Lord Ham . Let the doores be shut vpon him , that he may play the Foole no way , but in ' s owne house . Farewell Ophe . O helpe him , you sweet Heauens
shakespeare#Ham . If thou doest Marry , Ile giue thee this Plague for thy Dowrie . Be thou as chast as Ice , as pure as Snow , thou shalt not escape Calumny . Get thee to a Nunnery . Go , Farewell . Or if thou wilt needs Marry , marry a fool : for Wise men know well enough , what monsters you make of them .
shakespeare#To a Nunnery go , and quickly too . Farwell Ophe . O heauenly Powers , restore him Ham . I haue heard of your pratlings too wel enough .
shakespeare#God has giuen you one pace , and you make your selfe another : you gidge , you amble , and you lispe , and nickname Gods creatures , and make your Wantonnesse , your Ignorance . Go too , Ile no more on ' t , it hath made me mad . I say , we will haue no more Marriages . Those that are married already , all but one shall liue , the rest shall keep as they are . To a Nunnery , go . Exit Hamlet .
shakespeare#Ophe . O what a Noble minde is heere o ' re - throwne ? The Courtiers , Soldiers , Schollers : Eye , tongue , sword , Th ' expectansie and Rose of the faire State , The glasse of Fashion , and the mould of Forme , Th ' obseru ' d of all Obseruers , quite , quite downe . Haue I of Ladies most deiect and wretched , That suck ' d the Honie of his Musicke Vowes : Now see that Noble , and most Soueraigne Reason , Like sweet Bels iangled out of tune , and harsh , That vnmatch ' d Forme and Feature of blowne youth , Blasted with extasie . Oh woe is me , T ' haue seene what I haue seene : see what I see . Enter King , and Polonius .
shakespeare#King . Loue ? His affections do not that way tend , Nor what he spake , though it lack ' d Forme a little , Was not like Madnesse . There ' s something in his soule ? O ' re which his Melancholly sits on brood , And I do doubt the hatch , and the disclose Will be some danger , which to preuent I haue in quicke determination Thus set it downe . He shall with speed to England For the demand of our neglected Tribute : Haply the Seas and Countries different With variable Obiects , shall expell This something setled matter in his heart : Whereon his Braines still beating , puts him thus From fashion of himselfe .
shakespeare#What thinke you on ' t ? Pol . It shall do well . But yet do I beleeue The Origin and Commencement of this greefe Sprung from neglected loue . How now Ophelia ? You neede not tell vs , what Lord Hamlet saide , We heard it all .
shakespeare#My Lord , do as you please , But if you hold it fit after the Play , Let his Queene Mother all alone intreat him To shew his Greefes : let her be round with him , And Ile be plac ' d so , please you in the eare Of all their Conference . If she finde him not , To England send him : Or confine him where Your wisedome best shall thinke King . It shall be so : Madnesse in great Ones , must not vnwatch ' d go . Exeunt . Enter Hamlet , and two or three of the Players .
shakespeare#Ham . Speake the Speech I pray you , as I pronounc ' d it to you trippingly on the Tongue : But if you mouth it , as many of your Players do , I had as liue the Town - Cryer had spoke my Lines : Nor do not saw the Ayre too much your hand thus , but vse all gently ; for in the verie Torrent , Tempest , and ( as I say ) the Whirle - winde of Passion , you must acquire and beget a Temperance that may giue it Smoothnesse . O it offends mee to the Soule , to see a robustious Pery - wig - pated Fellow , teare a Passion to tatters , to verie ragges , to split the eares of the Groundlings : who ( for the most part ) are capeable of nothing , but inexplicable dumbe shewes , & noise : I could haue such a Fellow whipt for o ' re - doing Termagant : it outHerod ' s Herod . Pray you auoid it Player . I warrant your Honor
shakespeare#Ham . Be not too tame neyther : but let your owne Discretion be your Tutor . Sute the Action to the Word , the Word to the Action , with this speciall obseruance : That you ore - stop not the modestie of Nature ; for any thing so ouer - done , is fro [ m ] the purpose of Playing , whose end both at the first and now , was and is , to hold as ' twer the Mirrour vp to Nature ; to shew Vertue her owne Feature , Scorne her owne Image , and the verie Age and Bodie of the Time , his forme and pressure . Now , this ouer - done , or come tardie off , though it make the vnskilfull laugh , cannot but make the Iudicious greeue ; The censure of the which One , must in your allowance o ' reway a whole Theater of Others . Oh , there bee Players that I haue seene Play , and heard others praise , and that highly ( not to speake it prophanely ) that neyther hauing the accent of Christians , nor the gate of Christian , Pagan , or Norman , haue so strutted and bellowed , that I haue thought some of Natures Iouerney - men had made men , and not made them well , they imitated Humanity so abhominably Play .

For there be of them , that will themselues laugh , to set on some quantitie of barren Spectators to laugh too , though in the meane time , some necessary Question of the Play be then to be considered : that ' s Villanous , & shewes a most pittifull Ambition in the Foole that vses it .

Nay , do not thinke I flatter : For what aduancement may I hope from thee , That no Reuennew hast , but thy good spirits To feed & cloath thee . Why shold the poor be flatter ' d ?
shakespeare#No , let the Candied tongue , like absurd pompe , And crooke the pregnant Hindges of the knee , Where thrift may follow faining ? Dost thou heare , Since my deere Soule was Mistris of my choyse , And could of men distinguish , her election Hath seal ' d thee for her selfe . For thou hast bene As one in suffering all , that suffers nothing . A man that Fortunes buffets , and Rewards Hath ' tane with equall Thankes . And blest are those , Whose Blood and Iudgement are so well co - mingled , That they are not a Pipe for Fortunes finger . To sound what stop she please .

shakespeare#Nay then let the Diuel weare blacke , for Ile haue a suite of Sables . Oh Heauens ! dye two moneths ago , and not forgotten yet ? Then there ' s hope , a great mans Memorie , may out - liue his life halfe a yeare : But byrlady he must builde Churches then : or else shall he suffer not thinking on , with the Hoby - horsse , whose Epitaph is , For o , For o , the Hoby - horse is forgot . Hoboyes play . The dumbe shew enters .
shakespeare#Enter a King and Queene , very louingly ; the Queene embracing him . She kneeles , and makes shew of Protestation vnto him . He takes her vp , and declines his head vpon her neck . Layes him downe vpon a Banke of Flowers . She seeing him a - sleepe , leaues him . Anon comes in a Fellow , takes off his Crowne , kisses it , and powres poyson in the Kings eares , and Exits .
shakespeare#The Queene returnes , findes the King dead , and makes passionate Action . The Poysoner , with some two or three Mutes comes in againe , seeming to lament with her . The dead body is carried away : The Poysoner Wooes the Queene with Gifts , she seemes loath and vnwilling awhile , but in the end , accepts his loue . Exeunt . Ophe . What meanes this , my Lord ?
shakespeare#Ham . Marry this is Miching Malicho , that meanes Mischeefe Ophe . Belike this shew imports the Argument of the Play ? Ham . We shall know by these Fellowes : the Players cannot keepe counsell , they ' l tell all

shakespeare#You are naught , you are naught , Ile marke the Play . Enter Prologue . For vs , and for our Tragedie , Heere stooping to your Clemencie : We begge your hearing Patientlie Ham . Is this a Prologue , or the Poesie of a Ring ? Ophe .
shakespeare#' Tis briefe my Lord Ham . As Womans loue . Enter King and his Queene . King . Full thirtie times hath Phoebus Cart gon round , Neptunes salt Wash , and Tellus Orbed ground : And thirtie dozen Moones with borrowed sheene , About the World haue times twelue thirties beene , Since loue our hearts , and Hymen did our hands Vnite comutuall , in most sacred Bands
shakespeare#Bap . So many iournies may the Sunne and Moone Make vs againe count o ' re , ere loue be done . But woe is me , you are so sicke of late , So farre from cheere , and from your former state , That I distrust you : yet though I distrust , Discomfort you ( my Lord ) it nothing must : For womens Feare and Loue , holds quantitie , In neither ought , or in extremity : Now what my loue is , proofe hath made you know , And as my Loue is siz ' d , my Feare is so King . Faith I must leaue thee Loue , and shortly too : My operant Powers my Functions leaue to do : And thou shalt liue in this faire world behinde , Honour ' d , belou ' d , and haply , one as kinde . For Husband shalt thou - Bap .
shakespeare#Oh confound the rest : Such Loue , must needs be Treason in my brest : In second Husband , let me be accurst , None wed the second , but who kill ' d the first Ham . Wormwood , Wormwood Bapt . The instances that second Marriage moue , Are base respects of Thrift , but none of Loue . A second time , I kill my Husband dead , When second Husband kisses me in Bed
shakespeare#King . I do beleeue you . Think what now you speak : But what we do determine , oft we breake : Purpose is but the slaue to Memorie , Of violent Birth , but poore validitie : Which now like Fruite vnripe stickes on the Tree , But fall vnshaken , when they mellow bee . Most necessary ' tis , that we forget To pay our selues , what to our selues is debt : What to our selues in passion we propose , The passion ending , doth the purpose lose . The violence of other Greefe or Ioy , Their owne ennactors with themselues destroy : Where Ioy most Reuels , Greefe doth most lament ; Greefe ioyes , Ioy greeues on slender accident . This world is not for aye , nor ' tis not strange That euen our Loues should with our Fortunes change .
shakespeare#For ' tis a question left vs yet to proue , Whether Loue lead Fortune , or else Fortune Loue . The great man downe , you marke his fauourites flies , The poore aduanc ' d , makes Friends of Enemies : And hitherto doth Loue on Fortune tend , For who not needs , shall neuer lacke a Frend : And who in want a hollow Friend doth try , Directly seasons him his Enemie . But orderly to end , where I begun , Our Willes and Fates do so contrary run , That our Deuices still are ouerthrowne , Our thoughts are ours , their ends none of our owne . So thinke thou wilt no second Husband wed . But die thy thoughts , when thy first Lord is dead Bap .
shakespeare#Nor Earth to giue me food , nor Heauen light , Sport and repose locke from me day and night : Each opposite that blankes the face of ioy , Meet what I would haue well , and it destroy : Both heere , and hence , pursue me lasting strife , If once a Widdow , euer I be Wife Ham . If she should breake it now King . ' Tis deepely sworne : Sweet , leaue me heere a while , My spirits grow dull , and faine I would beguile The tedious day with sleepe Qu .

shakespeare#Ham . No , no , they do but iest , poyson in iest , no Offence i ' th ' world King . What do you call the Play ? Ham . The Mouse - trap : Marry how ?
shakespeare#Tropically : This Play is the Image of a murder done in Vienna : Gonzago is the Dukes name , his wife Baptista : you shall see anon : ' tis a knauish peece of worke : But what o ' that ? Your Maiestie , and wee that haue free soules , it touches vs not : let the gall ' d iade winch : our withers are vnrung . Enter Lucianus . This is one Lucianus nephew to the King Ophe . You are a good Chorus , my Lord

Powres the poyson in his eares . Ham . He poysons him i ' th ' Garden for ' s estate : His name ' s Gonzago : the Story is extant and writ in choyce Italian .

Good my Lord put your discourse into some frame , and start not so wildely from my affayre Ham .

shakespeare#Ham . Make you a wholsome answere : my wits diseas ' d . But sir , such answers as I can make , you shal command : or rather you say , my Mother : therfore no more but to the matter . My Mother you say Rosin . Then thus she sayes : your behauior hath stroke her into amazement , and admiration
shakespeare#Ham . Oh wonderfull Sonne , that can so astonish a Mother . But is there no sequell at the heeles of this Mothers admiration ? Rosin . She desires to speake with you in her Closset , ere you go to bed Ham .

shakespeare#I do beseech you Guild . I know no touch of it , my Lord Ham . ' Tis as easie as lying : gouerne these Ventiges with your finger and thumbe , giue it breath with your mouth , and it will discourse most excellent Musicke . Looke you , these are the stoppes
shakespeare#Guild . But these cannot I command to any vtterance of hermony , I haue not the skill Ham . Why looke you now , how vnworthy a thing you make of me : you would play vpon mee ; you would seeme to know my stops : you would pluck out the heart of my Mysterie ; you would sound mee from my lowest Note , to the top of my Compasse : and there is much Musicke , excellent Voice , in this little Organe , yet cannot you make it .

Now could I drink hot blood , And do such bitter businesse as the day Would quake to looke on . Soft now , to my Mother : Oh Heart , loose not thy Nature ; let not euer The Soule of Nero , enter this firme bosome : Let me be cruell , not vnnaturall , I will speake Daggers to her , but vse none : My Tongue and Soule in this be Hypocrites .

We will our selues prouide : Most holie and Religious feare it is To keepe those many many bodies safe That liue and feede vpon your Maiestie Rosin .
shakespeare#The single And peculiar life is bound With all the strength and Armour of the minde , To keepe it selfe from noyance : but much more , That Spirit , vpon whose spirit depends and rests The liues of many , the cease of Maiestie Dies not alone ; but like a Gulfe doth draw What ' s neere it , with it . It is a massie wheele Fixt on the Somnet of the highest Mount . To whose huge Spoakes , ten thousand lesser things Are mortiz ' d and adioyn ' d : which when it falles , Each small annexment , pettie consequence Attends the boystrous Ruine . Neuer alone Did the King sighe , but with a generall grone King . Arme you , I pray you to this speedie Voyage ; For we will Fetters put vpon this feare , Which now goes too free - footed

Fare you well my Liege , Ile call vpon you ere you go to bed , And tell you what I know King . Thankes deere my Lord . Oh my offence is ranke , it smels to heauen , It hath the primall eldest curse vpon ' t , A Brothers murther .
shakespeare#Pray can I not , Though inclination be as sharpe as will : My stronger guilt , defeats my strong intent , And like a man to double businesse bound , I stand in pause where I shall first begin , And both neglect ; what if this cursed hand Were thicker then it selfe with Brothers blood , Is there not Raine enough in the sweet Heauens To wash it white as Snow ? Whereto serues mercy , But to confront the visage of Offence ? And what ' s in Prayer , but this two - fold force , To be fore - stalled ere we come to fall , Or pardon ' d being downe ? Then Ile looke vp , My fault is past . But oh , what forme of Prayer Can serue my turne ? Forgiue me my foule Murther : That cannot be , since I am still possest Of those effects for which I did the Murther .

In the corrupted currants of this world , Offences gilded hand may shoue by Iustice , And oft ' tis seene , the wicked prize it selfe Buyes out the Law ; but ' tis not so aboue , There is no shuffling , there the Action lyes In his true Nature , and we our selues compell ' d Euen to the teeth and forehead of our faults , To giue in euidence . What then ? What rests ? Try what Repentance can . What can it not ?
shakespeare#Yet what can it , when one cannot repent ? Oh wretched state ! Oh bosome , blacke as death !

shakespeare#Ham . Such an Act That blurres the grace and blush of Modestie , Cals Vertue Hypocrite , takes off the Rose From the faire forehead of an innocent loue , And makes a blister there . Makes marriage vowes As false as Dicers Oathes . Oh such a deed , As from the body of Contraction pluckes The very soule , and sweete Religion makes A rapsidie of words . Heauens face doth glow , Yea this solidity and compound masse , With tristfull visage as against the doome , Is thought - sicke at the act Qu .
shakespeare#Aye me ; what act , that roares so lowd , & thunders in the Index Ham . Looke heere vpon this Picture , and on this , The counterfet presentment of two Brothers : See what a grace was seated on his Brow , Hyperions curles , the front of Ioue himselfe , An eye like Mars , to threaten or command A Station , like the Herald Mercurie New lighted on a heauen - kissing hill : A Combination , and a forme indeed , Where euery God did seeme to set his Seale , To giue the world assurance of a man . This was your Husband . Looke you now what followes . Heere is your Husband , like a Mildew ' d eare Blasting his wholsom breath .
shakespeare#Haue you eyes ? Could you on this faire Mountaine leaue to feed , And batten on this Moore ? Ha ? Haue you eyes ?

Once more goodnight , And when you are desirous to be blest , Ile blessing begge of you .
shakespeare#For this same Lord , I do repent : but heauen hath pleas ' d it so , To punish me with this , and this with me , That I must be their Scourge and Minister .

Mine Eyes are made the fooles o ' th ' other Sences , Or else worth all the rest : I see thee still ; And on thy Blade , and Dudgeon , Gouts of Blood , Which was not so before .

Thou sowre and firme - set Earth Heare not my steps , which they may walke , for feare Thy very stones prate of my where - about , And take the present horror from the time , Which now sutes with it .

Lecherie , Sir , it prouokes , and vnprouokes : it prouokes the desire , but it takes away the performance . Therefore much Drinke may be said to be an Equiuocator with Lecherie : it makes him , and it marres him ; it sets him on , and it takes him off ; it perswades him , and dis - heartens him ; makes him stand too , and not stand too : in conclusion , equiuocates him in a sleepe , and giuing him the Lye , leaues him

shakespeare#He had none : His flight was madnesse : when our Actions do not , Our feares do make vs Traitors Rosse . You know not Whether it was his wisedome , or his feare Wife . Wisedom ? to leaue his wife , to leaue his Babes , His Mansion , and his Titles , in a place From whence himselfe do ' s flye ?
shakespeare#He loues vs not , He wants the naturall touch . For the poore Wren ( The most diminitiue of Birds ) will fight , Her yong ones in her Nest , against the Owle : All is the Feare , and nothing is the Loue ; As little is the Wisedome , where the flight So runnes against all reason Rosse . My deerest Cooz , I pray you schoole your selfe . But for your Husband , He is Noble , Wise , Iudicious , and best knowes The fits o ' th ' Season . I dare not speake much further , But cruell are the times , when we are Traitors And do not know our selues : when we hold Rumor From what we feare , yet know not what we feare , But floate vpon a wilde and violent Sea Each way , and moue .
shakespeare#I take my leaue of you : Shall not be long but Ile be heere againe : Things at the worst will cease , or else climbe vpward , To what they were before . My pretty Cosine , Blessing vpon you Wife . Father ' d he is , And yet hee ' s Father - lesse Rosse . I am so much a Foole , should I stay longer It would be my disgrace , and your discomfort .

shakespeare#Son . Nay how will you do for a Husband ? Wife . Why I can buy me twenty at any Market Son . Then you ' l by ' em to sell againe

shakespeare#Son . Who must hang them ? Wife . Why , the honest men Son . Then the Liars and Swearers are Fools : for there are Lyars and Swearers enow , to beate the honest men , and hang vp them
shakespeare#Wife . Now God helpe thee , poore Monkie : But how wilt thou do for a Father ? Son . If he were dead , youl ' d weepe for him : if you would not , it were a good signe , that I should quickely haue a new Father Wife . Poore pratler , how thou talk ' st ?
shakespeare#Enter a Messenger . Mes . Blesse you faire Dame : I am not to you known , Though in your state of Honor I am perfect ; I doubt some danger do ' s approach you neerely . If you will take a homely mans aduice , Be not found heere : Hence with your little ones To fright you thus . Me thinkes I am too sauage : To do worse to you , were fell Cruelty , Which is too nie your person . Heauen preserue you , I dare abide no longer .
shakespeare#Exit Messenger Wife . Whether should I flye ? I haue done no harme . But I remember now I am in this earthly world : where to do harme Is often laudable , to do good sometime Accounted dangerous folly . Why then ( alas ) Do I put vp that womanly defence , To say I haue done no harme ?
shakespeare#What are these faces ? Enter Murtherers . Mur . Where is your Husband ? Wife . I hope in no place so vnsanctified , Where such as thou may ' st finde him

shakespeare#Mal . Let vs seeke out some desolate shade , & there Weepe our sad bosomes empty Macd . Let vs rather Hold fast the mortall Sword : and like good men , Bestride our downfall Birthdome : each new Morne , New Widdowes howle , new Orphans cry , new sorowes Strike heauen on the face , that it resounds As if it felt with Scotland , and yell ' d out Like Syllable of Dolour Mal . What I beleeue , Ile waile ; What know , beleeue ; and what I can redresse , As I shall finde the time to friend : I wil .
shakespeare#What you haue spoke , it may be so perchance . This Tyrant , whose sole name blisters our tongues , Was once thought honest : you haue lou ' d him well , He hath not touch ' d you yet . I am yong , but something You may discerne of him through me , and wisedome To offer vp a weake , poore innocent Lambe T ' appease an angry God Macd . I am not treacherous Malc .
shakespeare#But Macbeth is . A good and vertuous Nature may recoyle In an Imperiall charge . But I shall craue your pardon : That which you are , my thoughts cannot transpose ; Angels are bright still , though the brightest fell . Though all things foule , would wear the brows of grace Yet Grace must still looke so Macd . I haue lost my Hopes
shakespeare#Malc . Perchance euen there Where I did finde my doubts . Why in that rawnesse left you Wife , and Childe ? Those precious Motiues , those strong knots of Loue , Without leaue - taking . I pray you , Let not my Iealousies , be your Dishonors , But mine owne Safeties : you may be rightly iust , What euer I shall thinke Macd .
shakespeare#Bleed , bleed poore Country , Great Tyrrany , lay thou thy basis sure , For goodnesse dare not check thee : wear y thy wrongs , The Title , is affear ' d . Far thee well Lord , I would not be the Villaine that thou think ' st , For the whole Space that ' s in the Tyrants Graspe , And the rich East to boot Mal . Be not offended : I speake not as in absolute feare of you : I thinke our Country sinkes beneath the yoake , It weepes , it bleeds , and each new day a gash Is added to her wounds . I thinke withall , There would be hands vplifted in my right : And heere from gracious England haue I offer Of goodly thousands . But for all this , When I shall treade vpon the Tyrants head , Or weare it on my Sword ; yet my poore Country Shall haue more vices then it had before , More suffer , and more sundry wayes then euer , By him that shall succeede
shakespeare#Macd . What should he be ? Mal . It is my selfe I meane : in whom I know All the particulars of Vice so grafted , That when they shall be open ' d , blacke Macbeth Will seeme as pure as Snow , and the poore State Esteeme him as a Lambe , being compar ' d With my confinelesse harmes Macd . Not in the Legions Of horrid Hell , can come a Diuell more damn ' d In euils , to top Macbeth
shakespeare#Mal . I grant him Bloody , Luxurious , Auaricious , False , Deceitfull , Sodaine , Malicious , smacking of euery sinne That ha ' s a name . But there ' s no bottome , none In my Voluptuousnesse : Your Wiues , your Daughters , Your Matrons , and your Maides , could not fill vp The Cesterne of my Lust , and my Desire All continent Impediments would ore - beare That did oppose my will . Better Macbeth , Then such an one to reigne Macd . Boundlesse intemperance In Nature is a Tyranny : It hath beene Th ' vntimely emptying of the happy Throne , And fall of many Kings .
shakespeare#But feare not yet To take vpon you what is yours : you may Conuey your pleasures in a spacious plenty , And yet seeme cold . The time you may so hoodwinke : We haue willing Dames enough : there cannot be That Vulture in you , to deuoure so many As will to Greatnesse dedicate themselues , Finding it so inclinde Mal . With this , there growes In my most ill - composd Affection , such A stanchlesse Auarice , that were I King , I should cut off the Nobles for their Lands , Desire his Iewels , and this others House , And my more - hauing , would be as a Sawce To make me hunger more , that I should forge Quarrels vniust against the Good and Loyall , Destroying them for wealth Macd . This Auarice stickes deeper : growes with more pernicious roote Then Summer - seeming Lust : and it hath bin The Sword of our slaine Kings : yet do not feare , Scotland hath Foysons , to fill vp your will Of your meere Owne .
shakespeare#All these are portable , With other Graces weigh ' d Mal . But I haue none . The King - becoming Graces , As Iustice , Verity , Temp ' rance , Stablenesse , Bounty , Perseuerance , Mercy , Lowlinesse , Deuotion , Patience , Courage , Fortitude , I haue no rellish of them , but abound In the diuision of each seuerall Crime , Acting it many wayes . Nay , had I powre , I should Poure the sweet Milke of Concord , into Hell , Vprore the vniuersall peace , confound All vnity on earth Macd .
shakespeare#O Scotland , Scotland Mal . If such a one be fit to gouerne , speake : I am as I haue spoken Mac . Fit to gouern ? No not to liue .
shakespeare#O Natio [ n ] miserable ! With an vntitled Tyrant , bloody Sceptred , When shalt thou see thy wholsome dayes againe ? Since that the truest Issue of thy Throne By his owne Interdiction stands accust , And do ' s blaspheme his breed ? Thy Royall Father Was a most Sainted - King : the Queene that bore thee , Oftner vpon her knees , then on her feet , Dy ' de euery day she liu ' d . Fare thee well , These Euils thou repeat ' st vpon thy selfe , Hath banish ' d me from Scotland . O my Brest , Thy hope ends heere
