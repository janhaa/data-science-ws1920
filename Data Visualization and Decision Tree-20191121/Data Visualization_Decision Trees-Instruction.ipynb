    "# Data Visualization and Decision Tree\n",
    "In this instruction, you will learn how to use python as a powerful tool for data visualization and making decision trees. Note that you do not need to do the requirements section if you have already done the enironmental setup. You need to add \"Seaborn_Datasets\" and \"DT_Datasets\" to the home page of your Jupyter notebook.\n",
    "## Requirements\n",
    "Before starting instruction, you should make sure that you have installed following libraries:\n",
    "- pandas\n",
    "- seaborn\n",
    "- numpy\n",
    "- matplotlib\n",
    "- scipy\n",
    "- sklearn\n",
    "- subprocess\n",
    "- graphviz\n",
    "- p_decision_tree\n",
    "\n",
    "If you have installed “Anaconda”, all these libraries should be installed on your system along with “Anaconda” (except \"p_decision_tree\"). You can check availability of a library by the following command:\n",
    "- python -c \"import {name of library}\"\n",
    "\n",
    "For example to check if “Numpy” is installed or not you can use the following command:\n",
    "- python -c \"import numpy\"\n",
    "\n",
    "In case there is any missing library, you can install it by the following command:\n",
    "- pip install {name of library}\n",
    "    \n",
    "If you have not installed “Graphviz” package, in the following link you can find the right package with respect to your operation system.\n",
    "- https://www.graphviz.org/download/\n",
    "\n",
    "After installing graphviz, you need to add the installed executable “dot” path to your system environment path (default path in Windows is “C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Graphviz2.38\\bin”).\n",

    "## Decision Tree (Numerical Descriptive Attributes)\n",
    "The \"scikit-learn\" library is used to make a decision tree based on numerical descriptive attributes. Note that \"scikit-learn\" as the main library for data science in Python is not able to make a decision tree based on categorical descriptive attributes, and you have to convert the categorical attributes to numerical before passing them to the classifier method. Also, the resulting decision tree by this library is a binary tree.\n",
    "In the following, you can find a sample code in order to make a decision tree based on numerical descriptive attributes, using \"scikit-learn\" library.\n",
    "\n",
    "“DecisionTreeClassifier” method of “sklearn” is used to generate the tree classifier. You can set the parameters of this method based on what you need. In the following you can find some of the most important parameters of this method:\n",
    "- Main parameters to specify the algorithm\n",
    "    - Criterion: The function to measure the quality of a split. Supported criteria are \"gini\" for the Gini impurity and \"entropy\" for the information gain. (Default = \"gini\")\n",
    "    - Splitter: The strategy used to choose the split at each node. Supported strategies are \"best\" to choose the best split and \"random\" to choose the best random split. (Default = \"best\")\n",
    "- Parameters to control growth of the tree (Pruning)\n",
    "    - Min_samples_split: The minimum number of samples required to split an internal node\n",
    "    - Min_samples_leaf: The minimum number of samples required to be at a leaf node. (Default = 1)\n",
    "    - Max_depth: The maximum depth of the tree. If None, then nodes are expanded until all leaves are pure or until all leaves contain less than “min_samples_split” samples. (Default = None)\n",
    "    - Max_leaf_nodes: Grow a tree with “max_leaf_nodes” in best-first fashion. Best nodes are defined as relative reduction in impurity. If None then unlimited number of leaf nodes. (Default = None)\n",
    "    - Min_impurity_decrease: A node will be split if this split induces a decrease of the impurity greater than or equal to this value. (Default = 0.)"
